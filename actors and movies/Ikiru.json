The film examines the struggles of a terminally ill Tokyo bureaucrat (played by Takashi Shimura) and his final quest for meaning. The screenplay was partly inspired by Leo Tolstoy's 1886 novella The Death of Ivan Ilyich.\nThe film's major themes include learning how to live, the inefficiency of bureaucracy, and decaying family life in Japan, which have been the subject of analysis by academics and critics. Having won awards for Best Film at the Kinema Junpo and Mainichi Film Awards, it is considered one of the greatest films of all time.\n\nPlot\nKanji Watanabe has worked in the same monotonous, bureaucratic position in the Tokyo public works department for thirty years and is close to retirement. His wife is dead, and his son, Mitsuo, who lives with his wife in his father's home, seems eager to claim both his father's estate and lifetime pension. At work, he's a party to constant bureaucratic inaction. In one case, a group of parents who simply want permission to drain a cesspool so they can install a playground are endlessly routed to different offices in the same building.  \nAfter learning he has stomach cancer and less than a year to live, Watanabe attempts to come to terms with his impending death. He plans to tell Mitsuo about the cancer but decides against it when his son does not pay attention to him. He then tries to find escape in the pleasures of Tokyo's nightlife, guided by an eccentric novelist whom he has just met. In a nightclub, Watanabe requests a song from the piano player, and sings \"Gondola no Uta\" with great sadness. His singing greatly affects those watching him. Later, he realizes that hedonistic pleasure is not the solution.\nThe following day, Watanabe encounters Toyo, a young female subordinate, who needs his signature on her resignation. He takes comfort in observing her joyous love of life and enthusiasm, and he tries to spend as much time as possible with her. She eventually becomes suspicious of his intentions and grows wary of him. After persuading her to join him for the last time, he becomes open and asks for the secret to her love of life. She says that she does not know but that she found happiness in her new job making toys, which makes her feel as if she is playing with all the children of Japan. Inspired by her, Watanabe realizes that it is not too late for him to do something significant. Like Toyo, he wants to make something, but he is unsure what he can do within the city bureaucracy until he remembers the lobbying for a playground. He surprises everyone by returning to work after a long absence, and he begins pushing for a playground despite concerns that he is intruding on the jurisdiction of other departments.\nWatanabe dies, and at his wake, his former co-workers gather, after the opening of the playground, to figure out what caused such a dramatic change in his behavior. His transformation from listless bureaucrat to passionate advocate puzzles them. As the co-workers drink, they slowly realize that Watanabe must have known he was dying, even when his son denies this truth, as he was unaware of his father's condition. They also hear from a witness that, in the last few moments in Watanabe's life, he sat on the swing at the park he built. As the snow fell, he sang \"Gondola no Uta\". The bureaucrats vow to honor Watanabe's memory by following his example yet fall back into the same patterns as before the second they return to their offices.\n\nCast\nThemes\nLiving\nDeath is a major theme in the film, which leads to the protagonist Watanabe's quest to find the meaning of life. Initially, Watanabe looks to nightclubs and women to live life to the fullest, but winds up singing the 1915 song \"Gondola no Uta\" as an expression of loss. Professor Alexander Sesonske writes that in the nightclub scene, Watanabe realizes that \"pleasure is not life\" and that a goal gives him new happiness, with the song \"Happy Birthday to You\" symbolizing his rebirth. Because Toyo is young, she has the best insight as to how to live, and she is presented as the \"unlikely savior\" in Watanabe's \"redemption.\"\nAuthor Donald Richie wrote that the title of the film, meaning simply \"to live,\" could signify that \"existence is enough.\" However, Watanabe finds existence is painful, and he takes this idea as inspiration, wanting to ensure his life has not been futile. The justification of his life, found in his park, is how Watanabe discovered how \"to live.\" In the end, Watanabe now sings \"Gondola no Uta\" with great contentment.\n\nBureaucracy\nIkiru is also an \"indictment of Japanese bureaucracy.\" In Japan after World War II, it was expected that the salaryman would work predictably in accordance with an organization's rules. The scene where the mothers first visit the city office requesting a playground shows \"unconcern\" in the bureaucrats, who send the visitors on a \"farcical runaround,\" then ask them for a written request, with paperwork in the film as symbols of \"meaningless activity.\" However, Watanabe uses the bureaucracy to forge his legacy, and apparently he is not disturbed when the bureaucracy quickly forgets he drove the project to build the playground.\nJapanese health care is depicted as overly bureaucratic in the film when Watanabe visits a clinic in a \"poignant\" scene. The doctor is portrayed as paternalistic, and Watanabe does not stand up to his authority.\n\nFamily life\nAuthor Timothy Iles writes that, as with Yasujir\u014d Ozu's 1953 film Tokyo Story, Ikiru may hold a negative view about the state of family life in modern Japan. Watanabe has lived with his son for years, but they have fallen out of any true relationship. His son Mitsuo sees Watanabe as a bother and regards him as only an obstacle to his obtaining the money from Watanabe's will. The children fall short of their responsibility to respect their parents.\nUrbanization may be a reason for negative changes in Japanese society, but a reason for Watanabe and Mitsuo's drift is Watanabe's preoccupation with work. Another reason is Watanabe's not being with Mitsuo during a medical treatment when the boy was 10, which fits a pattern in Kurosawa's films of sons being overly harsh to their fathers.\n\nProduction\nThe film marked the first collaboration between director Akira Kurosawa and screenwriter Hideo Oguni. According to Oguni, the genesis of the film was Kurosawa's desire to make a film about a man who knows he is going to die and who wants a reason to live for a short time. Oguni was an experienced writer and was offered \u00a5500,000, and co-writer Shinobu Hashimoto was offered \u00a5150,000. Initially, Kurosawa told Hashimoto that a man who was set to die in 75 days had to be the theme and that the character's career was less important, with the director saying criminal, homeless man or government minister would be acceptable.\nThe screenwriters consulted Leo Tolstoy's novella The Death of Ivan Ilyich, and Oguni envisioned placing Watanabe's death halfway through the film. Kurosawa dictated the scene where Watanabe is on the swing and mentioned the beginning lyrics of \"Gondola no Uta.\" Because none of the men were familiar with the song, they consulted their eldest receptionist on the rest of the lyrics and the song title.\nKurosawa renamed the draft The Life of Kanji Watanabe to Ikiru, which Hashimoto found pretentious, but Oguni supported. The screenplay was completed on 5 February 1952.\n\nRelease\nIn Japan, Toho released the film on 9 October 1952. The film was screened in the 1954 Berlin International Film Festival.\nIn the United States, the film was shown for a short time in California in 1956 under the title Doomed. It opened as Ikiru in New York City on 29 January 1960. The film poster featured the stripper seen briefly in the film rather than Watanabe.\n\nCritical reception\nThe film won critical approval upon its release. Bosley Crowther, writing for The New York Times, called it \"a strangely fascinating and affecting film, up to a point\u2014that being the point where it consigns its aged hero to the great beyond,\" which he deemed \"anticlimactic.\" Crowther praised Shimura, writing he \"measures up through his performance in this picture with the top film actors anywhere,\" and complimented Miki Odagiri, Nobuo Kaneko and Yunosuke Ito. Variety staff called the film \"a tour-de-force...keeping a dramatic thread throughout and avoiding the mawkish.\"\nRoger Ebert added it to his list of Great Movies in 1996, stating \"Over the years I have seen Ikiru every five years or so, and each time it has moved me, and made me think. And the older I get, the less Watanabe seems like a pathetic old man, and the more he seems like every one of us.\" In his Great Movies review of Seven Samurai, Ebert called Ikiru Kurosawa's greatest film. In 2008, Wally Hammond of Time Out praised Ikiru as \"one of the triumphs of humanist cinema.\" That year, The New Yorker's Michael Sragow described it as a \"masterwork,\" noting Kurosawa was usually associated more with his action films. The scene featuring Watanabe on the swing in the playground he built has been described as \"iconic.\" Writer Pico Iyer has commented on the film's depiction of the postwar Japanese healthcare system, and historian David Conrad has remarked on its portrayal of Japanese governance at the moment Japan regained its sovereignty after a 7-year American occupation.\nIn 1972, Sight & Sound critics poll named Ikiru the 12th greatest film of all time. In 1999, The Village Voice ranked the film at number 212 in its list of the top 250 Best Films of the Century, based on a poll of critics. Empire magazine ranked Ikiru 459th on its 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time, and 44th on its 2010 list of \"The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema.\" In 2009, the film was voted at No. 13 on the list of \"The Greatest Japanese Films of All Time\" by Japanese film magazine Kinema Junpo. In 2010 Ikiru was included on Time's All-Time 100 best movies list. In 2012 the film ranked 127th and 132nd on critic's and director's poll respectively in Sight & Sound Top 250 Films list. Martin Scorsese included it on a list of \"39 Essential Foreign Films for a Young Filmmaker.\" The film was included in BBC's 2018 list of The 100 greatest foreign language films. Conversely, in 2016 The Daily Telegraph named it one of the 10 most overrated films. The film has a 98% positive rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 55 reviews, with a weighted average of 8.8\/10. The site's consensus reads: \"Ikiru is a well-acted and deeply moving humanist tale about a man facing his own mortality, one of legendary director Akira Kurosawa's most intimate films\".\n\nAccolades\nThe film competed for the Golden Bear at the 4th Berlin International Film Festival in 1954.\n\nLegacy\nKurosawa believed William Shakespeare's play Macbeth could serve as a cautionary tale complementing Ikiru, thus directing his 1957 film Throne of Blood. Ikiru was remade as a Japanese television film that debuted on TV Asahi on 9 September 2007, the day after a remake of Kurosawa's High and Low. The Ikiru remake stars kabuki actor Matsumoto K\u014dshir\u014d IX.\nAnand, a 1971 Indian-Hindi film, was  inspired by Ikiru. In 2003, DreamWorks attempted a U.S. remake, which would star Tom Hanks in the lead role, and it talked to Richard Price about adapting the screenplay. Jim Sheridan agreed to direct the film in 2004, though it has not been produced.\nA musical adaptation was produced in Japan in 2020, with music by Jason Howland and book by Chikae Takahashi.\nA British remake titled Living, adapted by Kazuo Ishiguro, directed by Oliver Hermanus, and starring Bill Nighy, was released in 2022.\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nBrannigan, Michael C.

He attended Doshisha University, but left before graduating, instead finding employment at Iwanami Productions (Iwanami Eiga). There he directed PR films and documentary films, while also participating in the \"Blue Group\" (Ao no kai) with other Iwanami filmmakers such as Noriaki Tsuchimoto, Shinsuke Ogawa, and Y\u014dichi Higashi, a group that was exploring new paths in documentary. Kuroki left Iwanami after experiencing conflicts with the sponsors of his Hokkaido, My Love (1960), and it was his Record of a Marathon Runner (1964) that helped spark changes in the Japanese documentary world.\nKuroki switched to fiction film, independently producing Silence Has No Wings (1966) and showing it at the Art Theatre Guild. He became one of the representative figures of ATG and independent Japanese cinema, and was particularly known for a series of works dealing with the atomic bombings of Japan, such as Tomorrow (1988) and The Face of Jizo (2004). These were in part spurred by his growing up near the city of Nagasaki. Kuroki's work also dealt with his own feelings of guilt from the war, as he felt responsible when some of his fellow students, who had been conscripted to work in a local factory, died in Allied bombings and he did not help.\n\nAwards\nKuroki won the best director award at the 2004 Mainichi Film Awards for The Face of Jizo and Utsukushii natsu Kirishima (2004).\n\nSelected filmography\nHokkaido, My Love (1960)\nRecord of a Marathon Runner (1964)\nSilence Has No Wings (1966)\nCuban Lover (1969)\nEvil Spirits of Japan (1970)\nRyoma Ansatsu (1975)\nPreparation for the Festival (1975)\nY\u016bgure made (1980)\nThe Bridge of Tears (1983)\nTomorrow (1988)\nR\u014dnin-gai (1990)\nPickpocket (2000)\nA Boy's Summer in 1945 (2002)\nThe Face of Jizo (2004)\nThe Blossoming of Kamiya Etsuko (2006)\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nKazuo Kuroki at IMDb\nRetrospective in Memory of Shohei Imamura and Kazuo Kuroki, National Film Center, Japan (in Japanese)","2":"A.K. is a 1985 French documentary film directed by Chris Marker about the Japanese director Akira Kurosawa.

It shows the last four years of Inoue's life while fighting cancer, and tries to capture his character and the influence he had on the people around him.\n\nSynopsis\nFilming Inoue both at public appearances and in private, and interviewing fellow writers like Yutaka Haniya as well as former pupils of Inoue's literary training centers, some of which speak frankly about their affair with their married teacher, Kazuo Hara draws a portrait of a multi-faceted personality: socially committed and egotistical, extroverted and hiding behind a persona.\nAdditionally, the film contains scenes which re-enact Inoue's childhood and youth according to his own accounts, which are partially put into question by statements from relatives.\n\nCast\nMitsuharu Inoue\nYutaka Haniya\nJakuch\u014d Setouchi\nHiroshi Noma\nIkuko Inoue\nKim Gumija as Mother Takako\nYoshie Yamamoto as Grandmother Saka\nHaruhi Iso as Choi Tsuruyo\nMasayuki Kubota as Mitsuharu as youth\nHiroya Sugiyama as Mitsuharu as child\n\nProduction\nEarly into the film's production, Inoue was diagnosed with liver metastasis, underwent an operation (which is shown in detail) and continued his work as a writer and teacher.

It was originally released in three parts, all of which were long thought to be lost until portions of the second part and much of the third part were discovered and restored in 1991. Since the film had once been voted in a 1959 Kinema Junp\u014d poll as the best Japanese film of all time, its discovery was significant. At the time of its release, It\u014d was the leader of a new style of samurai films that featured outlaw heroes and fast-cut sword fighting scenes.\n\nPlot\nThe three films focus on the travels of the kindly yakuza boss Kunisada Ch\u016bji. The existing print begins with Chuji on the road, fleeing the law while taking care of Kantaro, the son of a dead friend. He leaves Kantaro with Kabe Yasuemon, an honorable local boss, but is shocked to find out that his own men have been committing robberies using his own name. Angry, Chuji hits the road and eventually settles in another town, assuming another name and working as a clerk for a sake brewery. Okuma, the daughter of the brewer, falls in love with Chuji, but he ignores her. When he saves her brother from trouble with the Otozo gang, his identity is revealed and the police close in. Okume kills herself and Chuji flees, but the palsy he had been suffering from worsens and he is finally caught. His henchmen, however, succeed in rescuing him and bring him back to his home village. Unable to walk and confined to bed, Chuji is hidden in a storehouse. His woman, Oshina, discovers that one of his men has betrayed him, but it is too late. Despite the valiant efforts of his men to hold off the police, Chuji is finally arrested by the authorities.\n\nCast\nDenjir\u014d \u014ck\u014dchi as Kunisada Ch\u016bji\nNaoe Fushimi as Oshina\nRanko Sawa as Okume\nHideo Nakamura as Kantar\u014d\nKichiji Nakamura as Kabe Yasuemon\nMotoharu Isokawa as Kihei, a sake brewer\nYujir\u014d Asahina as Masakichi\nSeinosuke Sakamoto as Bunz\u014d\nKaj\u014d Onoe as Otoz\u014d\n\nReception\nIn Kinema Junp\u014d's poll of the best Japanese films of 1927, part two was number one and part three was number four.\n\nVersions\nIf the original three parts were projected together, the entire film would have totaled over four hours.

It was the last film of actresses Haruko Sugimura and Nobuko Otowa.\n\nPlot\nYoko, an aged but still active widowed actress, takes a rest from rehearsals and the hot temperature in Tokyo in her rural summer residence. Toyoko, her housemaid of many years, tells her that the 83-year-old gardener committed suicide, leaving behind a note which simply said, \"it's over\". On his self-made coffin, he had placed a heavy stone from the nearby riverbed, to be used for nailing the coffin's lid.\nLater, Yoko receives a phone call by Mr. Ushiguni, who is on a trip with his wife Tomie, an old friend and former theatre troupe colleague of Yoko. Yoko invites them into her house. Tomie is senile and has memory lapses and difficulties to recognise others, but with Yoko's help, she can still recite passages from Chekhov's plays The Seagull and Three Sisters, which they used to perform many years ago.\nThe next day, an armed man breaks into the house and demands food from the women at gunpoint. Tomie tries to grab his weapon, and moments later, he is arrested by the police. The intruder turns out to be a mentally ill criminal who had attacked residents of an old people's home, driven mad by their incessant playing croquet. Tomie receives a reward for helping to capture the escapee, but when she, her husband, Yoko and Toyoko go out to have lunch in an exclusive restaurant, they are disappointed to find that the envelope she was handed out contains only 10,000 yen rather than the 300,000 yen they had hoped for.\nThe Ushigunis leave the summer house to continue their journey. After their departure, Toyoko confesses to Yoko that she had an affair with Yoko's husband Saburo while she was on tour 22 years ago, and that Saburo is the father of Toyoko's daughter Akemi. Yoko is indignant at first, and Toyoko leaves the house, but eventually the women settle their dispute. Later, they attend the traditional \"tentative marriage\" ceremony of Akemi and her future husband Daigoro, a common local man, and watch various stylized costumed dances of sexual rituals.\nThe next morning, newspaper journalist Naoko visits Yoko's house, telling her that Tomie and her husband committed shinj\u016b in the ocean near Naoetsu, Niigata. Yoko realises that the couple had been on their last journey and that their visit was Tomie's means of saying goodbye. Together with the journalist, Yoko and Toyoko retrace their final steps. Back in her residence, Yoko packs her suitcase to return to Tokyo, instructing Toyoko to keep the gardener's stone for Yoko's coffin in case she should die. After Yoko has left, Toyoko takes the stone to the river and throws it into the water.\n\nCast\nHaruko Sugimura as Yoko Morimoto\nNobuko Otowa as Toyoko Yanagawa\nHideo Kanze as Fujihachiro Ushiguni\nKyoko Asagiri as Tomie Ushiguni\nToshiyuki Nagashima as Police Officer\nMitsuko Baisho as Naoko Yazawa\nYutaka Matsushige as Daigoro\nTomomi Seo as Akemi\nKatsumi Kiba as Intruder\nK\u014dichi Ueda as Chief of Police\nMasahiko Tsugawa as Saburo Morimoto\nMasaaki Uchino as Koji Kiyokawa\n\nProduction\nThe house in the mountains was director Shind\u014d's actual mountain retreat, and is the same building as the old man's house in Tree Without Leaves.

It is the third part of The Human Condition trilogy.\n\nPlot\nThe Japanese forces having been shattered during the events of the second film (Road to Eternity), Kaji and some comrades attempt to elude capture by Soviet forces and find the remnants of the Kwantung army in South Manchuria. Following the bayonetting of a Russian soldier, however, Kaji is increasingly sick of combat and decides to abandon any pretense of rejoining the army. Instead, he leads fellow soldiers and a growing number of civilian refugees as they attempt to flee the warzone and return to their homes. Lost in a dense forest, the Japanese begin to infight and eventually many die of hunger, poisonous mushrooms and suicide. Emerging from the forest on their last legs, Kaji and the refugees encounter regular Japanese army troops, who deny them food as if they were deserters. Carrying on further south, Kaji and his associates find a well-stocked farmhouse which is soon ambushed by Chinese peasant fighters. A prostitute to whom Kaji had shown kindness is killed by these partisans, and Kaji vows to fight them rather to escape. However, overpowered by these newly armed Chinese forces, Kaji and his fellow soldiers are nearly killed and are forced to run through a flaming wheat field to survive. Kaji then encounters a group of fifty Japanese army holdouts who are attempting to resume combat in alliance with Chiang Kai-shek, whom they believe will be supported by American forces, in a civil war against Russian-backed Communist Chinese. Kaji, a believer in pacifism and socialism, rejects this strategy as misguided and doomed to failure. Eventually, Kaji and a group of Japanese soldiers, whose number has grown to fifteen, fight through Russian patrols and find an encampment of women and old men who seek their protection. Kaji is driven to continue moving in search of his wife, but decides to surrender to Soviet forces when the encampment is besieged.\nCaptured by the Red Army and subjected to treatment that echoes the violence meted out to the Chinese in the first film, Kaji and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Terada resist the Japanese officers who run their work camp in cooperation with Soviet forces. While such resistance amounts to no more than picking through the Russians' garbage for scraps of food and wearing gunnysacks to protect them from increasingly colder weather, Kaji is branded a saboteur and judged by a Soviet tribunal to harsh labor. With a corrupt translator and no other means of talking to the Russian officers with whom he feels ideological sympathies, Kaji becomes increasingly disillusioned by conditions in the camp and with Communist orthodoxy. When Terada is driven to exhaustion and death by harsh treatment from the collaborating officer Kirihara, Kaji decides to kill the man and then escape the camp alone. Still dreaming of finding his wife and abused as a worthless beggar and as a \"Japanese devil\" by the Chinese peasants of whom he begs mercy, Kaji eventually succumbs to the cold and dies in the vast winter wasteland covered in snow.\n\nCast\nTatsuya Nakadai as Kaji\nKin Sugai\nKyoko Kishida as Ryuko\nY\u016bsuke Kawazu\nNobuo Kaneko\nAkira Yamauchi\nMichiyo Aratama as Michiko\nChish\u016b Ry\u016b\nHideko Takamine\n\nRelease\nThe film was released in 1961, while shown at various film festivals internationally. All-night marathons of the film were occasionally shown in Japan; screenings with Tatsuya Nakadai in attendance typically sold out.

These discs were noted for their poor image quality, cropped aspect ratio, lackluster sound, paraphrased English subtitle translation, and absence of extras. On September 8, 2009, The Criterion Collection released the film (again with the rest of the trilogy) with a brand new restoration, improved translation, a bonus disc with interviews, and a 12-page supplementary booklet.

It won the Kinema Junpo Award for best film.\n\nPlot\nThe film starts with a travelling kabuki troupe arriving by train at a provincial seaside town.  Kihachi Ichikawa (Takeshi Sakamoto), the head of the troupe, is a very popular actor.  He takes time off to visit a former mistress Otsune (Ch\u014dko Iida), with whom he had a son years before.

Kihachi and his son, Shinkichi, spend a fruitful afternoon fishing for dace in a nearby river.\nWhen the troupe's performance tour is postponed by the constant downpour around the region, one of the members of the troupe unwittingly reveals a secret: that Kihachi is seeing a woman every day. Otaka (Rieko Yagumo), one of Kihachi's actresses and his present mistress, decides to pay a visit to Otsune's watering-hole with fellow actress Otoki (Yoshiko Tsubouchi).  Kihachi becomes enraged, warns Otaka never to come and harass the mother and son again, and breaks off his relationship with her.\nTo get back at Otsune and Kihachi, Otaka suggests to Otoki to try to seduce Shinkichi and offers her some money.  Otoki waits for Shinkichi at a tree by the road one day and offers to meet after her performance at the same place.  Shinkichi agrees to the meeting, and the two start a clandestine love affair.\nAs time goes by, Otoki realizes she has fallen for Shinkichi.  She tells Shinkichi to forget her because she is merely a traveling actress.  Kihachi discovers their affair, confronts Otoki and slaps her, demanding to know what she wants.  Otoki reveals Otaka's setup, but tells him she now loves Shinkichi and is not doing this for money.  Kihachi then beats up Otaka, but realizes he no longer has any control over the affair.\nKihachi decides to disband the troupe, selling all their costumes and props.  The kabuki actors have one last night together.  Kihachi visits Otsune, and tells her of his troupe's break-up.  She invites him to stay with her for good, and they decide to tell Shinkichi of his paternity secret.  Shinkichi and Otoki return, but Shinkichi and Kihachi get into a violent quarrel when Kihachi hits Otoki repeatedly.\nOtsune now tells Shinkichi that Kihachi is his father, but Shinkichi refuses to acknowledge him for abandoning them.

Kihachi decides to restart another troupe, realizing he cannot stay.  Otoki asks to join him, but Kihachi leaves her in Otsune's care and asks Otoki to help his son be a great man.\nShinkichi comes down to look for his father but he has gone on the road.

The specifics of what constitutes an action film has been in scholarly debate since the 1980s. While some scholars such as David Bordwell suggested they were films that favor spectacle to storytelling, others such as Geoff King stated they allow the scenes of spectacle to be attuned to story telling. Action films are often hybrid with other genres, mixing into various forms ranging to comedies, science fiction films, and horror films.\nWhile the term \"action film\" or \"action adventure film\" has been used as early as the 1910s, the contemporary definition usually refers to a film that came with the arrival of New Hollywood and the rise of antiheros appearing in American films of the late 1960s and 1970s drawing from war films, crime films and Westerns. These genres were followed by what is referred to as the \"classical period\" in the 1980s. This was followed by the post-classical era where American action films were influenced by Hong Kong action cinema and the growing using of computer generated imagery in film. Following the September 11 attacks, a return to the early forms of the genre appeared in the wake of Kill Bill and The Expendables films.\nScott Higgins wrote in 2008 in Cinema Journal that action films are both one of the most popular and popularly derided of contemporary cinema genres, stating that \"in mainstream discourse, the genre is regularly lambasted for favoring spectacle over finely tuned narrative.\" Bordwell echoed this in his book, The Way Hollywood Tells It,  writing that the reception to the genre as being \"the emblem of what Hollywood does worst.\"\n\nCharacteristics\nIn the Journal of Film and Video, Lennart Soberson stated that the action film genre has been a subject of scholarly debate since the 1980s. Soberson wrote that repeated traits of the genre include chase sequences, fights, shootouts, explosions, and stunt work while other scholars asserted there were more underlying traits that define the genre. David Bordwell in The Way Hollywood Tells It wrote that audiences are \"told that spectacle over rides narrative\" in action cinema while Wheeler Winston Dixon echoed that these films were typified by \"excessive spectacle\" as a \"desperate attempt to mask the lack of content.\" Geoff King argued that the spectacle can also be a vehicle for narrative, opposed to interfering with it. Soberson stated that Harvey O'Brien had \"perhaps the most convincing understanding of the genre\", stating that the action film was \"best understood as a fusion of form and content. It represents the idea and ethic of action through a form in which action, agitation and movement are paramount.\"\nO'Brien wrote further in his book Action Movies: The Cinema of Striking Back to suggest action films being unique and not just a series of action sequences, stating that that the difference between Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) and Die Hard (1988), that while both were mainstream Hollywood blockbusters with hero asserting masculinity and overcoming obstacles to a personal and social solution, John McClane in Die Hard repeatedly firing his automatic pistol while swinging from a high rise was not congruent with the image of Indiana Jones in Raiders swinging his whip to fend off villains in the backstreets of Cairo. British author and academic Yvonne Tasker expanded on this topic, stating that action films have no clear and constant iconography or settings. In her book The Hollywood Action and Adventure Film (2015), she found that the most broadly consistent themes tend to be a characters quest from freedom from oppression such as a hero overcoming enemies or obstacles and physical conflicts or challenge, usually battling other humans or alien opponents.\nBy late 2010s studies of genre analysis, the term \"genre\" itself is often replaced or supplemented with the words \"mode\" and \"narrative form\" with all three terms often being used interchangeably. Johan H\u00f6glund and Agnieszka Soltysik Monnet said that the difference between these concepts are elusive, but stated that genre could be defined as belonging to specific historical and cultural moments while \"mode\" and \"form\" can refer to a larger pattern that operates across a wider historical and cultural field. In their book Action Cinema Since 2000 (2024), Tasker, Lisa Purse, and Chris Holmlund stated that thinking of action as a mode is more helpful than thinking of it as a genre. The three authors suggested that action frames a certain manner of filmmaking and viewing exceed genre without eclipsing it stating that websites such as IMDb and Wikipedia rarely label films by a single genre and that streaming services such as Amazon Prime and Netflix similarly dilutes what is marketed and received as action.\n\nHistory\nIn transnational cinema, there are two major trends in action films: Hollywood action films and their style being imitated around the globe and the other being Chinese-language martial arts films. The roots of action films extend into the beginning of film but it was only in the mid-20th century when action films developed into their own recognizable genre instead of being a collection of other types of films such as Westerns, swashbucklers or adventure films.\nFilms have been described \"action films\" or \"action-adventure film\" as early as the 1910s.  Only by the 1980s was the term action as its own unique genre used routinely in terms of promotion and reviewing practices.\n\nHong Kong action films\nThe first Chinese-language martial arts films can be traced to Shanghai cinema of the late 1920s. These films were popular during the period, which comprised almost 60% of the total Chinese films. Man-Fung Yip stated that these film were \"rather tame\" by contemporary standards. He wrote that they lacked the kind of dazzling action choreography as expected today and had crude and rudimentary special effects. These films came under increasing attack by both government officials and cultural elites for their allegedly superstitious and anarchistic tendencies, leading them to be banned in 1932. It was not until the base of Chinese commercial filmmaking was relocated from Shanghai to Hong Kong in the late 1940s that martial arts cinema was revived. These films contained much of the characteristics of the previous era. During this period, over 100 films were based on the adventures of real life Cantonese folk hero Wong Fei-hung who first appeared in film in 1949. These films primarily on circuited within Hong Kong and Cantonese-speaking areas with Chinese diaspora. Yip continued that these Hong Kong films were still lagging behind in aesthetic and technical standards that films from the United States, Europe and Japan had during this period.\nYip described Japanese cinema as the most advanced in Asia at the time. This was showcased by the international breakthrough of Akira Kurosawa's films like Rashomon (1950). The film genre known as the chanbara was at its height in Japan. The style was a sub-genre to the jidai-geki, or period drama with an emphasis on sword fighting and action. It had a similar level of popularity to that of the Western in the United States. The most internationally known films of this era were the films Kurosawa with Seven Samurai (1954), The Hidden Fortress (1958), and Yojimbo (1961). By at least the 1950s, Japanese films were looked upon as a model to be emulated by Hong Kong film production, and Hong Kong film companies began actively enlisting professionals from Japan, such as cinematographer Tadashi Nishimoto to contribute to color and widescreen cinematography. New literary sources also developed in martial arts films of this period, with the xinpai wuxia xiaoshuo (or \"new school martial arts fiction\") coming into prominence with the success of Liang Yusheng's Longhu Dou Jinghua (1954) and Jin Yong's Shujian enchou lu (1956) which showed influence of the Shanghai martial arts films but also circulated from Hong Kong to Taiwan and Chinese communities overseas. This led to a growing demand in both local and regional markets in the early 1960s and saw a surge in production of Hong Kong martial arts films that went beyond the stories about Wong Fei-hung which were declining in popularity. These new martial arts films featured magical swordplay and higher production values and more sophisticated special effects than the previous films with Shaw Brothers a campaign of \"new school\" (xinpai) martial arts swordplay films such as Xu Zenghong's Temple of the Red Lotus (1965) and King Hu's Come Drink with Me (1966).\n\nIn the 1970s, the Hong Kong martial arts films began to grow under the format of yanggang (\"staunch masculinity\") mostly through the films of Chang Cheh which were popular. This transition led to the kung fu film sub-genre at beginning of the decade and moved beyond the swordplay films with contemporary settings of late Qing or early Republican periods and had more hand-to-hand combat over supernatural swordplay and special effects. A new studio, Golden Harvest quickly became one of independent filmmakers to grant creative freedom and pay and attracted new directors and actors, including Bruce Lee. The popularity of kung fu films and Bruce Lee led to attract a global audience of these films in the United States and Europe, but was cut short on Lee's death in 1973 leading the phases popularity to decline. Following a period of stagnation, Chang Cheh and Lau Kar-leung revitalized the genre with shaolin kung fu films and Chor Yuen's series of darker swordplay films based on the novels of Gu Long. Kung Fu comedies appeared featuring Jackie Chan as martial arts films flourished into the 1980s. Other films again modernized the form with gangster films of John Woo (A Better Tomorrow (1986), The Killer (1989)) and the Wong Fei Hung saga returning in Tsui Hark's Once Upon a Time in China featuring Jet Li which again revitalized the swordplay styled films. By the turn of the century Hollywood action films would look towards Hong Kong cinema and bringing some of their major actors and directors over to apply their style to their films, such as Chan, Woo, Li, Michelle Yeoh and Yuen Woo-Ping. The release of Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) led to a Global release status of Chinese-language martial arts films, most notably Zhang Yimou's Hero (2002) and House of Flying Daggers (2004), Stephen Chow's Kung Fu Hustle (2004) and Chen Kaige's The Promise (2005). Most Hong Kong action films in the first quarter of the 21st century, such as those in Cold War (2012), Cold War 2 (2016) and The White Storm film series have their violence toned down, especially compared to the earlier work of directors like Woo and Johnnie To. Antong Chen, in his study on the Hong Kong action film, wrote that the influence of China and the amount of Chinese co-productions made with Hong Kong created a shift in these films, particularly following the release of Infernal Affairs (2002).\n\nHollywood action films\nHarvey O'Brien wrote in 2012 that the contemporary action film emerged through other genres, primarily Westerns, crime and war films and can be separated into four forms: the formative, the classical, the postclassical and neoclassical phases. Yvonne Tasker reiterated this in her book on action and adventure films, saying that action films became a distinct genre during the New Hollywood period of the 1970s.\n\nThe formative films would be from the 1960s to the early 1980s where the Antihero appears in cinema, featuring characters who act and transcend the law and social conventions. This appears initially in films like Bullitt (1968) where a tough police officer protects society by upholding the law against systematic corruption. This extended into films which O'Brien described as \"knee-jerk responses\" to perceived threats with rogue cop and vigilante films such as Dirty Harry (1971) and Death Wish (1974) where the restoration of order is only possible by force and anti-social characters prepared to act when society does not. The vigilantism reappears in other films that were exploitative of southern society such as Billy Jack (1971) and White Lightning (1973) and \"good ol' boy\" comedies like Smokey and the Bandit (1977). This era also emphasizes the car chase scenes as moments of spectacle in films like Bullitt and The French Connection (1971). O'Brien described these films as emphasizing \"the fusion of man and machine\" with the drivers and vehicles acting as one, concluding with what he described as \"the ultimate in apocalyptic modernity and social erasure\" in Mad Max 2 (1981).\nO'Brien described the classical form of action cinema to be the 1980s. The decade continued the trends of formative period with heroes as avengers (Lethal Weapon (1987)), rogue police officers (Die Hard (1988)) and mercenary warriors (Commando (1985)). Following the continuity of the car and man hybrid of the previous decade, the 1980s featured weaponized men with who were either also carrying weapons such as Sudden Impact (1983), trained to be weapons (American Ninja (1985)) or imbued with technology (RoboCop (1987)). O'Brien noted that the formative trends at this point had become \"identifiably generic\" as film industries began to reproduced these films during the decade producers like Joel Silver and production companies like The Cannon Group, Inc. began to formulate production of these films with both high and low budgets. The action films of this era have roots in classical story telling, specifically rooted from martial arts films and Westerns, and are built around a three-act structure centered on survival, resistance and revenge with narratives where the physical body of the hero is tested, traumatized and ultimately triumphant.\nThe third shift in action cinema, the postclassical, was defined by the predominance of Eastern cinema and its aesthetics, primarily the wire-work of Hong Kong action cinema from the classical era, through the convention of the increasingly computer generated effects. This saw the decline of overt masculinity in the action film which corresponded with the end of the Cold War in 1991, while the rise of self-referential and parodies of this era grew in films like Last Action Hero (1993). O'Brien described this era as being soft where the hard bodies of the classical era were replaced with computer generated imagery such as that of Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991). This was displayed in corresponding with corresponded with millennial angst and apocalypticism showcased in films like Independence Day (1996) and Armageddon (1998). Action films of mass destruction began requiring more overtly super heroic characters with further comic book adaptations being made with increased non-realistic settings with films like The Matrix (1999).\nThe fourth phase arrived following the September 11 attacks in 2001, which suggested an end to fantastical elements that defined the action hero and genre. Following the release of Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill: Volume 1 (2003) and Kill Bill: Volume 2 (2004) revisited the tropes of 1970s action films leading a renaissance of vengeance narratives in films like The Brave One (2007) and Taken (2008). O'Brien found that Tarantino's films were post-modern takes on the themes that rescinded irony to restore \"cinephile re-actualization of the genre's conventions.\" The genre went into full circle resurrecting films from the classical period with Live Free or Die Hard (2007) and Rambo (2008) finding the characters navigating a contemporary world while also acknowledging their age, culminating into The Expendables (2010) film.\nThe most commercially successful action films and franchise of the 21st century have been comic book adaptations, which commenced with the X-Men and is seen in other series such as Spider-Man, and Iron Man series. Tasker wrote that despite the central characters in superhero cinema being extraordinary, occasionally even God-like, they often followed the traces of the central character becoming powerful of which is fundamental to action films, often dealt with origin stories in superhero films.\n\nSubgenres\nHybrid genres\nAction films often interface with other genres. Tasker wrote that films are often labelled action thrillers, action-fantasy and action-adventure films with different nuances. Tasker later discussed that the term action film genre and adventure are often used in hybrid, and are even used interchangeably. Along with Holmund and Purse, Tasker wrote that the action films expansiveness complicates easy categorization and though the genre is often spoken of as singular genre, it is rarely discussed as singular style.\nScreenwriter and academic Jule Selbo expanded on this, describing a film as \"crime\/action\" or an \"action\/crime\" or other hybrids was \"only a semantic exercise\" as both genres are important in the construction phase of the narrative. Mark Bould in A Companion to Film Noir (2013) said that categorization of multiple generic genre labels was common in film reviews who are rarely concerned with succinct descriptions that evoke elements of the film's form, content and make no claims beyond on how these elements combine.\nFilm Studies began to engage generic hybridity in the 1970s. James Monaco wrote in 1979 in American Film Now: The People, The Power, The Money, the Movies that \"the lines that separate on genre from another have continued to disintegrate.\" Tasker said that most post-classical action films are hybrids, drawing from genres as varied as war films, science fiction, horror, crime, martial arts and comedy films.\n\nMartial arts film\nIn Chinese-language films, both wuxia and kung fu are genre-specific terms, while martial arts is a generic term to refer to several types of films containing martial arts.\n\nWuxia\nThe wuxia film is the oldest genre in Chinese cinema. Stephen Teo wrote in his book on Wuxia that there is no satisfactory English translation of the term, with it often being identified as \"the swordplay film\" in critical studies. It is derived from the Chinese words wu denoting militarist or martial qualities and xia denoting chivalry, gallantry, and qualities of knighthood. The term wuxia entered into popular culture in the serialization of Jinaghu qixia zhuan (1922) (transl.\u2009Legend of the Strange Swordsmen).  In wuxia, the emphasis is on chivalry and righteousness and allows for phantasmagoric actions over the kung fu film's more ground-based combat.\n\nKung fu film\nThe Kung fu film emerged in the 1970s from the swordplay films. Its name is derived from the Cantonese term gong fu which has two meanings: the physical effort required to completing a task and the abilities and skills acquired over time. Films from the period reflected on the cultural and social climate from the period, as seen in invoking Japanese or Wester imperialist forces as foils.\nThe kung fu film came out of the wuxia films.  In comparison to the wuxia,  film, the focus on the kung fu film is on the martial arts over chivalry,  The martial arts films was in decline by the mid-1970s in Hong Kong in relation to the stock market crash which went from over 150 films in 1972 to just over 80 in 1975, which led to a downfall in martial arts films produced. When the economy became to rebound, a new trend of martial arts films, the Shaolin kung fu films emerged and sparked a revival of the genre. Unlike the wuxia, the kung fu film primarily focuses on fighting on the ground. While heroes in kung fu films often display chivalry, they generally hail from different fighting schools, namely wudang and shaolin.\n\nAmerican-styled productions\nAmerican martial arts films feature what author M. Ray Lott described as a more realistic style of violence over the Hong Kong wuxia films with more realism and are often low-budget productions. Martial arts began routinely appearing in fight scenes in American films in the 1960s with films like The Born Losers (1967) which was predominantly a drama, interspersed with martial arts scenes. American martial arts films predominantly came into production following the release of Enter the Dragon (1973), with the only higher-budgeted American film to follow in its wake being The Yakuza (1974). Lott noted the two films would lead to the two subsequent styles of martial arts films in the United States, with films like Enter the Dragon about people who reveled in combat, often in a tournament setting, and The Yakuza which had several genres attached to it, but featured several martial arts sequences. By the end of the 1970s, the style was an established genre in American cinema, often featuring tough heroic characters who would fight and not think about their actions until after a fight sequence. In the 1980s, American martial arts films reflected the national move towards conservatism, reflected in films of Chuck Norris and other actors such as Sho Kosugi. The genre would shift from theatrical releases towards the end of the decade with the rise of home video, the lower box-office of American martial arts productions, and a significant portion of direct-to-video action films that first were made in the late 1980s in the United States were martial arts films. Towards the end of the 1990s, production of low-budget marital arts films declined as no new stars in the genre developed and older actors such as Cynthia Rothrock and Steven Seagal started showing up in less and less films. Even internationally popular films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) had negligible effects in American productions in either the direct-to-video field, or in similarly low-budgeted theatrical releases such as Bulletproof Monk (2003).\nWhile the American styled-films were predominantly made in the United States, productions were also made in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong and South Africa, and were predominantly shot in the English-language.\n\nHeroic bloodshed\nHeroic Bloodshed is a that originates with English-language Hong Kong action and crime film fan communities in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Author Bey Logan stated that the term was coined by Rick Baker, in the British fanzine Eastern Heroes. The term is used broadly. Baker described the style as Hong Kong action films which feature gangsters and gunplay and martial arts that were more violent than kung fu films and academic Kristof Van Den Troost described it a term used to distinguish Hong Kong gun-heavy action films from period martial arts films from the late 1980s and early 1990s.\nIn the Chinese language, the term used for these films is jinghungpin, literally meaning \"hero films\". Academic Laikwan Pang asserts that these gangster films appeared at a time when Hong Kong citizens felt particularly powerless with the handover of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to China set for 1997.\nThe key directors of the genre were John Woo and Ringo Lam, and producer Tsui Hark, with the starting point of the genre being traced to Woo's A Better Tomorrow (1986) make a record-breaking HK$34.7 million at the Hong Kong box office. The style of these films would influence American productions, such as Michael Bay's Bad Boys II (2003) and the Wachowskis' The Matrix (1999). Korean media recognized the more fatalistic and pessimistic tone of these films, leading to Korean journalists to label the style as \"Hong Kong noir\". The influence of these films was evident in early Korean films such as Im Kwon-taek's General's Son (1990) and later films such Song Hae-sung's A Better Tomorrow (2010), Cold Eyes (2013) and New World (2013).\nPostcolonial Hong Kong cinema has struggled to maintain its international identity as a provider of these types action films because the talents involved had abandoned the Hong Kong film industry after the handover in 1997.\n\nRegional action cinema\nAnglophone action film scholarship has tended to emphasize bigger budget American action films, with academics tending to find films that fall out of Hollywood productions as not quite fitting definitions of the genre. By 2024, many national and regional industries were known for action films. These include international films such as Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, South Korean, Japanese, Thai, Brazilian, Chinese, South African, French and Italian action titles.\n\nAustralia\nAt the turn of the millennium, Australian genre films have gained increasing acceptance in the Australian feature film industry, while the action genre represented a small percentage of its output in the 21st century.\nScholars of Australian genre film generally used the term \"action-adventure\" which allows them to apply it to various forms of narratives such as tongue in cheek heroic posturing stories like Crocodile Dundee (1986), road movies or bush\/outback films. In the book Australian Genre Film, Amanda Howell suggested that this label was used to help distance Australian cinema from Hollywood films as it would be suggesting commerce over culture and that it would be \"quite unacceptable to make Australian movies using conventions established in the U.S.A.\" Howell stated this to be the case with action films of the 1970s and 1980s with Brian Trenchard-Smith's Turkey Shoot (1982) being the most notorious. Smith had previously released films like Deathcheaters (1976) and Stunt Rock (1979) when financial incentives were available for overtly commercial projects. She commented that action films did tell identifiably Australian stories such as the Sandy Harbutt's biker film Stone (1974) and Miller's post-apocalyptic film Mad Max (1979) derived from Australia's social and cultural realities, as well as how George Miller's later Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) derived from Australia's long-standing cinematic fascination with the road and cars and a history of cultural anxiety towards a bleak and forbidding outback landscape opposed to the optimism of American action films.\n\nFrance\nFrance is a major European country for film production and has made co-production commitments with 44 countries around the world. Around beginning of the 21st century, France began producing a series of films explicitly intended for international markets, with action films representing a significant portion. These films include Taxi 2 (2000), Kiss of the Dragon (2001), District 13 (2004) and Unleashed (2005). Whan asked about the Americanization of these French films, Christophe Gans, director of Brotherhood of the Wolf (2001) stated that \"Hollywood ownership of certain elements [...] must be challenged, in order to show that these elements have also long been present in European culture.\"\nThe most significant producers of French action films with international ambitions is Luc Besson's France-based EuropaCorp, who released films like Taxi (1998) and From Paris with Love (2010). EuropaCorp produced Transporter franchise starred British actor Jason Statham and made him an action film star, which led him to feature in The Expendables series by the end of the 2010s.\n\nIndia\nThe action film genre has been a staple of Bollywood cinema.\nIn the 1970s, the Bollywood action film consolidated with two films starring Amitabh Bachchan: Prakash Mehra's Zanjeer (1973) and Yash Chopra's Deewaar (1975). The box office success of these films made Bachchan a star and spawned the \"angry young man\" film in Bollywood cinema.  \nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s, the action genre film declined considerably with new films predominantly featuring former body builders failing to reach the popularity Bachan had. These films predominantly earned their revenue through longer runs at B-grade theatres. A cycle of action films came from these films in the 1980s and 1990s called the Avenging Woman film, where female protagonists seek justice for a rape victim, where the protagonist seeks revenge through violence.\nIn 2009, the action genre was re-popularized with the box office success of Wanted (2009) starring Salman Khan. Khan reinvented his screen persona with that of his image in the Bollywood press who reported on him in the headlines of Bollywood magazines for his public brawls and affairs with leading actresses. In Dabangg (2010), Khan continued with this public persona, which was repeated in several of his later films such as Ready (2011), Bodyguard (2011),  Ek Tha Tiger (2012) and Dabangg 2 (2012).\nFrom the 1980s, generations of actors in Telugu cinema have invoked Hong Kong action films, such as Srihari who stated he wanted to become an actor after watching his first Bruce Lee film. Several films in Telugu cinema were remakes of Hong Kong films, such as Hello Brother (1994) which is based on Twin Dragons (1992). Other films such as the martial arts film Bhadrachlam (2001), borrows from American cinema with the Jean-Claude Van Damme film Kickboxer (1989). SS Rajamouli's RRR (2022) was among the highest budgeted films made in India, and became a rare hit film outside of Indian diaspora, where it broke box office records in Japan and performed exceptionally well in American box office.\n\nJapan\nJapan was a difficult market for Hong Kong action cinema to break into. Prompted by the success of Enter the Dragon and the popularity of Bruce Lee, Toei made their own Bruce Lee-styled martial arts films, with The Street Fighter and its two sequels starring Sonny Chiba as well as a spin-off with a female lead similar to Hong Kong's Angela Mao called Sister Street Fighter. The success of Enter the Dragon briefly allowed an influx of Hong Kong films to Japan, but the trend did not last, with 28 Hong Kong films, mostly kung fu films, being released in 1974, and the number decreasing to five in 1975, four in 1977 and only two in 1978.\nRyuhei Kitamura, director of Versus (2000), said in 2004 that he grew frustrated with the Japanese film industry as producers felt they couldn't make action films in competition with Hong Kong or American productions. Versus grew to become popular outside of Japan, and Kitamura said he was aiming for the foreign audience, as he was disappointed with the current state of Japanese films. Kitamura's characters have been described as \"a careful combination of the maverick independence of 1980s Hollywood action heroes and the calmness and acceptance of Japanese samurai, a consistent criticism of Japanese people today.\" Kitamura followed up Versus with two manga-inspired big-budget action films, Azumi and Sky High. Both released in 2003, the former was one of the highest-grossing movies of the year in Japan. Following LoveDeath, Kitamura's next directing work was in the United States.\n\nKorea\nThe action cinema of South Korea mostly existed on the margins of the film industry in South Korea. The genre was initially called  the Hwalkuk (\"living theatre\") was a term that indicated plays and films driven by action scenes, while this term has not been used regularly since the late 1970s, with \"action movie\" becoming the more familiar term. The Korean action films came from Japanese cinema, James Bond series, and Hong Kong action cinema. As North Korea borders China, it block access to the continent from a South Korean perspective, the Cold War allowed South Koreans to substitute deferred travel beyond the border through films with locations shot in Hong Kong. While melodrama and comedy were stapples in South Korean cinema, most action films were sporadic and tied to the use of locations such as Hong Kong. These films often featured one-legged or otherwise handicapped action characters similar to those of Japanese films (Zatoichi) and Hong Kong films (The One-Armed Swordsmen). These included Im Kwon-taek's Returned Left-Handed Man (1968), Aekkunun Bak's One-Eyd Park (1970) and Lee Doo-yong's Returned One-Legged Man (1974).\nIn the 1990s, the country's national cinema was in decline leading to Hong Kong gangster films filled in this void leading to large commercial success at the national box office. Early Korean heirs to Hong Kong action films include Rules of The Game (1994), Beat (1997), and Green Fish (1997) involving men who gain confidence and achieve personal growth as they embark on journeys to protect national state and meet devastating ends.\nSouth Korean cinema only received international attention in both art film and blockbuster formats towards the end of the 1990s. Films such as Chunhang (2000) and Memento Mori (2000) and action films Shiri (1999) and Nowhere to Hide (1999) received commercial releases in North America, Asia, and Europe. The success of the latter two films was unprecedented, and was followed by other South Korean action films in the early 2000s reaching the top of the local box office. These South Korean films mimic some traits of the Hong Kong action cinema, such melodramatic male bonding and marginalized women characters, while the Korean films also have greater elements of tragedy and romance emphasized.\n\nReception\nMost martial arts films made before the mid-1960s were Cantonese-language productions. In comparison, Mandarin-language films were an integral part of Hong Kong cinema due to the influx of Shanghai film talent in the postwar period. These films were targeted at the more educated and more refined middle-class audiences who saw themselves as above the contemporary martial arts films.\nScott Higgins wrote in 2008 in Cinema Journal that Hollywood action films are both one of the most popular and popularly derided of contemporary cinema genres, stating that \"in mainstream discourse, the genre is regularly lambasted for favoring spectacle over finely tuned narrative.\" Bordwell echoed this in his book, The Way Hollywood Tells It,  writing that the reception to the genre as being \"the emblem of what Hollywood does worst.\"\nTasker wrote that when action and adventure films secured awards, it is often in categories such as visual effects and sound editing.\n\nAcclaimed action films\nTime Out magazine conducted a poll with fifty experts in the field of action cinema, including actors, critics, filmmakers and stuntmen. Out of the 101 films ranked in the poll, the following films were voted the top ten best action films of all time.\n\nGender in action cinema\nHong Kong\nIn Hong Kong, the \"new school\" of martial arts films that Shaw Brothers brought in 1965 featured what featured what Yip described as \"strong, active female characters as protagonists.\" These female-centered films were challenged with the rise of a new male heroic prototype marked by a strong sense of youthful energy and defiance and by a propensity for violent action, identified with the films of Chang Cheh.\n\nHollywood\nViolent female characters have been part of cinema since its early inception, with characters such as Kate Kelly brandishing a shotgun in The Story of the Kelly Gang (1906). Women traditionally appear in action films as romantic interests, tomboys, or sidekicks to male protagonists.\nViolent white women would appear in other genres as well such as the femme fatales in film noir and horror films of the 1970s. Violent women were common in action films since the 1960s. These films featured working-class women exacting revenge. Films of the 1970s featured black women such as Pam Grier in films like Foxy Brown (1974).\nIn the 1980s, a new symbolically transgressive character emerged in the form of Ellen Ripley in Aliens (1986) and Sarah Connor in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) and the title character in China O'Brien (1990) who were physically muscular and or enacted more extreme violence that was usually reserve for male action leads. In her book Contemporary Action Cinema (2011), Lisa Purse described the media response to female leads in action films  reveal a discomfort about their presence and are often described with hesitant terms of women moving into territories that are perceived as masculine. Revealing woman in this form deconstructs the notion that traditional marks of masculinity are not exclusive to men and that musculature was not natural, but something to be achieved. Accusations of these muscular women of the era were levelled at that them by 1993 were that they were \"men in drag\" and that the films generally have to \"explain\" why their female leads displayed physical aggression and why they were \"driven to do it.\" As the 1990s went on, Hollywood films began having more conventional looking women in their action films such as The Long Kiss Goodnight (1996).\n\nA vibrant debate exists about whether hypersexualization is itself empowering and, if not, whether a hypersexualized female character can still represent strength and autonomy.\nHypersexualized female action leads had tight fitting or revealing costumes that Tasker identified as \"exaggerated statements of sexuality\" and in the tradition of \"fetishistic figure of fantasy\" derives from comic books and soft pornography. This originated in television with characters like Buffy Summers (Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997\u20132003)) and Xena (Xena: Warrior Princess (1995\u20132001)). These series popularity demonstrated a growing market for female action film heroes, in films of the 2000s like Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), Charlie's Angels (2000), Ultraviolet (2006), Salt (2010) and series like Underworld and Resident Evil. These series like their television series earlier, had their leads eroticized as active and physically capable while also being scantily-clad, hyper-feminized similar to the woman of exploitation films of the 1970s such as Caged Heat (1974) and Big Bad Mama (1974). While characters like Frank in The Transporter series are permitted to visibly sweat, strain and be bloodied, Purse found a reluctance for filmmakers to have their female leads have any appearance warping injuries to ensure a perfectly made-up face. Comedy is often used in films of this period to place the female leads in implausible elements, such as in Charlie's Angels, Fantastic Four (2005) and My Super Ex-Girlfriend (2006). The fighting styles of women also tend towards more traditionally feminine fluid movements of martial arts, over using guns or directly punching.\nPurse wrote that the contemporary female action film lead's sexualized brand had her in close proximity of post-feminism discourse about choice, power and sexuality. Marc O'Day interprets the action heroine's dual status of an active subject and sexual object was overturning the traditional gender binary because the films \"assume that women are powerful\" without resorting to justify her physical aggression through narratives involving maternal drive, mental instability or trauma. Purse found that female leads in films like Elektra (2005), Kill Bill, Underworld, Charlie's Angels and Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005) did showcase women having expensive cars, clothing, travel, homes and often high-paying jobs, but that this was only shown as being applicable to white middle-class women. Purse found that these women were empowered at the price of women of other ethnicities. This is seen in Aeon Flux (2005) where Sithandra dies protecting Aeon and Rain's death to make way for Alice in Resident Evil (2002).\n\nSee also\nList of action film actors\nList of action film directors\nList of female action heroes and villains\nAction hero\nFilm genre\nLists of action films\nList of female action heroes\n\nReferences\nSources\nFurther reading\nInness, Sherrie, ed.

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers in the history of cinema. Kurosawa displayed a bold, dynamic style, strongly influenced by Western cinema yet distinct from it; he was involved with all aspects of film production.\nKurosawa entered the Japanese film industry in 1936, following a brief stint as a painter. After years of working on numerous films as an assistant director and scriptwriter, he made his debut as a director during World War II with the popular action film Sanshiro Sugata (1943). After the war, the critically acclaimed Drunken Angel (1948), in which Kurosawa cast the then little-known actor Toshiro Mifune in a starring role, cemented the director's reputation as one of the most important young filmmakers in Japan. The two men would go on to collaborate on another fifteen films.\nRashomon (1950), which premiered in Tokyo, became the surprise winner of the Golden Lion at the 1951 Venice Film Festival. The commercial and critical success of that film opened up Western film markets for the first time to the products of the Japanese film industry, which in turn led to international recognition for other Japanese filmmakers. Kurosawa directed approximately one film per year throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, including a number of highly regarded (and often adapted) films, including Ikiru (1952), Seven Samurai (1954), Throne of Blood (1957), The Hidden Fortress (1958), Yojimbo (1961), High and Low (1963) and Red Beard (1965). After the 1960s he became much less prolific; even so, his later work\u2014including two of his final films, Kagemusha (1980) and Ran (1985)\u2014continued to receive great acclaim.\nIn 1990, he accepted the Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement. Posthumously, he was named \"Asian of the Century\" in the \"Arts, Literature, and Culture\" category by AsianWeek magazine and CNN, cited there as being among the five people who most prominently contributed to the improvement of Asia in the 20th century. His career has been honored by many retrospectives, critical studies and biographies in both print and video, and by releases in many consumer media.\n\nBiography\nChildhood to war years (1910\u20131945)\nChildhood and youth (1910\u20131935)\nKurosawa was born on March 23, 1910, in \u014cimachi in the \u014cmori district of Tokyo. His father Isamu (1864\u20131948), a member of a samurai family from Akita Prefecture, worked as the director of the Army's Physical Education Institute's lower secondary school, while his mother Shima (1870\u20131952) came from a merchant's family living in Osaka. Akira was the eighth and youngest child of the moderately wealthy family, with two of his siblings already grown up at the time of his birth and one deceased, leaving Kurosawa to grow up with three sisters and a brother.\nIn addition to promoting physical exercise, Isamu Kurosawa was open to Western traditions and considered theatre and motion pictures to have educational merit. He encouraged his children to watch films; young Akira viewed his first movies at the age of six. An important formative influence was his elementary school teacher Mr. Tachikawa, whose progressive educational practices ignited in his young pupil first a love of drawing and then an interest in education in general. During this time, Akira also studied calligraphy and Kendo swordsmanship.\nAnother major childhood influence was Heigo Kurosawa (1906-1933), Akira's older brother by four years. In the aftermath of the Great Kant\u014d earthquake and the subsequent Kant\u014d Massacre of 1923, Heigo took the thirteen-year-old Akira to view the devastation. When Akira wanted to look away from the corpses of humans and animals scattered everywhere, Heigo forbade him to do so, encouraging Akira instead to face his fears by confronting them directly. Some commentators have suggested that this incident would influence Kurosawa's later artistic career, as the director was seldom hesitant to confront unpleasant truths in his work.\nHeigo was academically gifted, but soon after failing to secure a place in Tokyo's foremost high school, he began to detach himself from the rest of the family, preferring to concentrate on his interest in foreign literature. In the late 1920s, Heigo became a benshi (silent film narrator) for Tokyo theaters showing foreign films and quickly made a name for himself. Akira, who at this point planned to become a painter, moved in with him, and the two brothers became inseparable. With Heigo's guidance, Akira devoured not only films but also theater and circus performances, while exhibiting his paintings and working for the left-wing Proletarian Artists' League. However, he was never able to make a living with his art, and, as he began to perceive most of the proletarian movement as \"putting unfulfilled political ideals directly onto the canvas\", he lost his enthusiasm for painting.\nWith the increasing production of talking pictures in the early 1930s, film narrators like Heigo began to lose work, and Akira moved back in with his parents. In July 1933, Heigo died by suicide. Kurosawa has commented on the lasting sense of loss he felt at his brother's death and the chapter of Something Like an Autobiography that describes it\u2014written nearly half a century after the event\u2014is titled, \"A Story I Don't Want to Tell\". Only four months later, Kurosawa's eldest brother also died, leaving Akira, at age 23, the only one of the Kurosawa brothers still living, together with his three surviving sisters.\n\nDirector in training (1935\u20131941)\nIn 1935, the new film studio Photo Chemical Laboratories, known as P.C.L. (which later became the major studio Toho), advertised for assistant directors. Although he had demonstrated no previous interest in film as a profession, Kurosawa submitted the required essay, which asked applicants to discuss the fundamental deficiencies of Japanese films and find ways to overcome them. His half-mocking view was that if the deficiencies were fundamental, there was no way to correct them. Kurosawa's essay earned him a call to take the follow-up exams, and director Kajir\u014d Yamamoto, who was among the examiners, took a liking to Kurosawa and insisted that the studio hire him. The 25-year-old Kurosawa joined P.C.L. in February 1936.\nDuring his five years as an assistant director, Kurosawa worked under numerous directors, but by far the most important figure in his development was Yamamoto. Of his 24 films as A.D., he worked on 17 under Yamamoto, many of them comedies featuring the popular actor Ken'ichi Enomoto, known as \"Enoken\". Yamamoto nurtured Kurosawa's talent, promoting him directly from third assistant director to chief assistant director after a year. Kurosawa's responsibilities increased, and he worked at tasks ranging from stage construction and film development to location scouting, script polishing, rehearsals, lighting, dubbing, editing, and second-unit directing. In the last of Kurosawa's films as an assistant director for Yamamoto, Horse (1941), Kurosawa took over most of the production, as his mentor was occupied with the shooting of another film.\nYamamoto advised Kurosawa that a good director needed to master screenwriting. Kurosawa soon realized that the potential earnings from his scripts were much higher than what he was paid as an assistant director. He later wrote or co-wrote all his films, and frequently penned screenplays for other directors such as Satsuo Yamamoto's film, A Triumph of Wings (Tsubasa no gaika, 1942). This outside scriptwriting would serve Kurosawa as a lucrative sideline lasting well into the 1960s, long after he became famous.\n\nWartime films and marriage (1942\u20131945)\nIn the two years following the release of Horse in 1941, Kurosawa searched for a story he could use to launch his directing career. Towards the end of 1942, about a year after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, novelist Tsuneo Tomita published his Musashi Miyamoto-inspired judo novel, Sanshiro Sugata, the advertisements for which intrigued Kurosawa. He bought the book on its publication day, devoured it in one sitting, and immediately asked Toho to secure the film rights. Kurosawa's initial instinct proved correct as, within a few days, three other major Japanese studios also offered to buy the rights. Toho prevailed, and Kurosawa began pre-production on his debut work as director.\nShooting of Sanshiro Sugata began on location in Yokohama in December 1942. Production proceeded smoothly, but getting the completed film past the censors was an entirely different matter. The censorship office considered the work to be objectionably \"British-American\" by the standards of wartime Japan, and it was only through the intervention of director Yasujir\u014d Ozu, who championed the film, that Sanshiro Sugata was finally accepted for release on March 25, 1943. (Kurosawa had just turned 33.) The movie became both a critical and commercial success. Nevertheless, the censorship office would later decide to cut out some 18 minutes of footage, much of which is now considered lost.\nHe next turned to the subject of wartime female factory workers in The Most Beautiful, a propaganda film which he shot in a semi-documentary style in early 1944. To elicit realistic performances from his actresses, the director had them live in a real factory during the shoot, eat the factory food and call each other by their character names. He would use similar methods with his performers throughout his career.\n\nDuring production, the actress playing the leader of the factory workers, Y\u014dko Yaguchi, was chosen by her colleagues to present their demands to the director. She and Kurosawa were constantly at odds, and it was through these arguments that the two paradoxically became close. They married on May 21, 1945, with Yaguchi two months pregnant (she never resumed her acting career), and the couple would remain together until her death in 1985. They had two children, both surviving Kurosawa as of 2018: a son, Hisao, born December 20, 1945, who served as producer on some of his father's last projects, and Kazuko, a daughter, born April 29, 1954, who became a costume designer.\nShortly before his marriage, Kurosawa was pressured by the studio against his will to direct a sequel to his debut film. The often blatantly propagandistic Sanshiro Sugata Part II, which premiered in May 1945, is generally considered one of his weakest pictures.\nKurosawa decided to write the script for a film that would be both censor-friendly and less expensive to produce. The Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail, based on the Kabuki play Kanjinch\u014d and starring the comedian Enoken, with whom Kurosawa had often worked during his assistant director days, was completed in September 1945. By this time, Japan had surrendered and the occupation of Japan had begun. The new American censors interpreted the values allegedly promoted in the picture as overly \"feudal\" and banned the work. It was not released until 1952, the year another Kurosawa film, Ikiru, was also released. Ironically, while in production, the film had already been savaged by Japanese wartime censors as too Western and \"democratic\" (they particularly disliked the comic porter played by Enoken), so the movie most probably would not have seen the light of day even if the war had continued beyond its completion.\n\nEarly postwar years to Red Beard (1946\u20131965)\nFirst postwar works (1946\u20131950)\nAfter the war, Kurosawa, influenced by the democratic ideals of the Occupation, sought to make films that would establish a new respect towards the individual and the self. The first such film, No Regrets for Our Youth (1946), inspired by both the 1933 Takigawa incident and the Hotsumi Ozaki wartime spy case, criticized Japan's prewar regime for its political oppression. Atypically for the director, the heroic central character is a woman, Yukie (Setsuko Hara), who, born into upper-middle-class privilege, comes to question her values in a time of political crisis. The original script had to be extensively rewritten and, because of its controversial theme and gender of its protagonist, the completed work divided critics. Nevertheless, it managed to win the approval of audiences, who turned variations on the film's title into a postwar catchphrase.\nHis next film, One Wonderful Sunday, premiered in July 1947 to mixed reviews. It is a relatively uncomplicated and sentimental love story dealing with an impoverished postwar couple trying to enjoy, within the devastation of postwar Tokyo, their one weekly day off. The movie bears the influence of Frank Capra, D. W. Griffith and F. W. Murnau, each of whom was among Kurosawa's favorite directors. Another film released in 1947 with Kurosawa's involvement was the action-adventure thriller, Snow Trail, directed by Senkichi Taniguchi from Kurosawa's screenplay. It marked the debut of the intense young actor Toshiro Mifune. It was Kurosawa who, with his mentor Yamamoto, had intervened to persuade Toho to sign Mifune, during an audition in which the young man greatly impressed Kurosawa, but managed to alienate most of the other judges.\n\nDrunken Angel is often considered the director's first major work. Although the script, like all of Kurosawa's occupation-era works, had to go through rewrites due to American censorship, Kurosawa felt that this was the first film in which he was able to express himself freely. A gritty story of a doctor who tries to save a gangster (yakuza) with tuberculosis, it was also the first time that Kurosawa directed Mifune, who went on to play major roles in all but one of the director's next 16 films (the exception being Ikiru). While Mifune was not cast as the protagonist in Drunken Angel, his explosive performance as the gangster so dominates the drama that he shifted the focus from the title character, the alcoholic doctor played by Takashi Shimura, who had already appeared in several Kurosawa movies. However, Kurosawa did not want to smother the young actor's immense vitality, and Mifune's rebellious character electrified audiences in much the way that Marlon Brando's defiant stance would startle American film audiences a few years later. The film premiered in Tokyo in April 1948 to rave reviews and was chosen by the prestigious Kinema Junpo critics poll as the best film of its year, the first of three Kurosawa movies to be so honored.\nAfter the completion of Drunken Angel, Toho became embroiled in a months-long labor strike, in which the Toho union occupied the grounds of the studio. When Toho management ceased paying workers' salaries, Kurosawa formed a touring acting troupe to raise funds, directing Anton Chekhov's The Proposal, and an adaptation of Drunken Angel starring Mifune and Shimura. Disillusioned by the division and violence between employees at Toho, the underhanded tactics of Toho leadership, and the breaking of the occupation by police and military standoff, Kurosawa left Toho, later recalling \"I had come to understand that the studio I had thought was my home actually belonged to strangers\".\nKurosawa, with producer S\u014djir\u014d Motoki and fellow directors and friends Kajiro Yamamoto, Mikio Naruse and Senkichi Taniguchi, formed a new independent production unit called Film Art Association (Eiga Geijutsu Ky\u014dkai). For this organization's debut work, and first film for Daiei studios, Kurosawa turned to a contemporary play by Kazuo Kikuta and, together with Taniguchi, adapted it for the screen. The Quiet Duel starred Toshiro Mifune as an idealistic young doctor struggling with syphilis, a deliberate attempt by Kurosawa to break the actor away from being typecast as gangsters. Released in March 1949, it was a box office success, but is generally considered one of the director's lesser achievements.\n\nHis second film of 1949, also produced by Film Art Association and released by Shintoho, was Stray Dog. It is a detective movie (perhaps the first important Japanese film in that genre) that explores the mood of Japan during its painful postwar recovery through the story of a young detective, played by Mifune, and his fixation on the recovery of his handgun, which was stolen by a penniless war veteran who proceeds to use it to rob and murder. Adapted from an unpublished novel by Kurosawa in the style of a favorite writer of his, Georges Simenon, it was the director's first collaboration with screenwriter Ryuzo Kikushima, who would later help to script eight other Kurosawa films. A famous, virtually wordless sequence, lasting over eight minutes, shows the detective, disguised as an impoverished veteran, wandering the streets in search of the gun thief; it employed actual documentary footage of war-ravaged Tokyo neighborhoods shot by Kurosawa's friend, Ishir\u014d Honda, the future director of Godzilla. The film is considered a precursor to the contemporary police procedural and buddy cop film genres.\nScandal, released by Shochiku in April 1950, was inspired by the director's personal experiences with, and anger towards, Japanese yellow journalism. The work is an ambitious mixture of courtroom drama and social problem film about free speech and personal responsibility, but even Kurosawa regarded the finished product as dramatically unfocused and unsatisfactory, and almost all critics agree. However, it would be Kurosawa's second film of 1950 that would ultimately win him, and Japanese cinema, a whole new international audience.\n\nInternational recognition (1950\u20131958)\nAfter finishing Scandal, Kurosawa was approached by Daiei studios to make another film for them. Kurosawa picked a script by an aspiring young screenwriter, Shinobu Hashimoto, who would eventually work on nine of his films. Their first joint effort was based on Ry\u016bnosuke Akutagawa's experimental short story \"In a Grove\", which recounts the murder of a samurai and the rape of his wife from various different and conflicting points of view. Kurosawa saw potential in the script, and with Hashimoto's help, polished and expanded it and then pitched it to Daiei, who were happy to accept the project due to its low budget.\nThe shooting of Rashomon began on July 7, 1950, and, after extensive location work in the primeval forest of Nara, wrapped on August 17. Just one week was spent in hurried post-production, hampered by a studio fire, and the finished film premiered at Tokyo's Imperial Theatre on August 25, expanding nationwide the following day. The movie was met by lukewarm reviews, with many critics puzzled by its unique theme and treatment, but it was nevertheless a moderate financial success for Daiei.\n\nKurosawa's next film, for Shochiku, was The Idiot, an adaptation of the novel by the director's favorite writer, Fyodor Dostoevsky. The story is relocated from Russia to Hokkaido, but otherwise adheres closely to the original, a fact seen by many critics as detrimental to the work. A studio-mandated edit shortened it from Kurosawa's original cut of 265 minutes to just 166 minutes, making the resulting narrative exceedingly difficult to follow. The severely edited film version is widely considered to be one of the director's least successful works and the original full-length version no longer exists. Contemporary reviews of the much shortened edited version were very negative, but the film was a moderate success at the box office, largely because of the popularity of one of its stars, Setsuko Hara.\nMeanwhile, unbeknownst to Kurosawa, Rashomon had been entered in the Venice Film Festival, due to the efforts of Giuliana Stramigioli, a Japan-based representative of an Italian film company, who had seen and admired the movie and convinced Daiei to submit it. On September 10, 1951, Rashomon was awarded the festival's highest prize, the Golden Lion, shocking not only Daiei but the international film world, which at the time was largely unaware of Japan's decades-old cinematic tradition.\nAfter Daiei briefly exhibited a subtitled print of the film in Los Angeles, RKO purchased distribution rights to Rashomon in the United States. The company was taking a considerable gamble. It had put out only one prior subtitled film in the American market, and the only previous Japanese talkie commercially released in New York had been Mikio Naruse's comedy, Wife! Be Like a Rose!, in 1937: a critical and box-office flop. However, Rashomon's commercial run, greatly helped by strong reviews from critics and even the columnist Ed Sullivan, earned $35,000 in its first three weeks at a single New York theatre, an almost unheard-of sum at the time.\nThis success in turn led to a vogue in America and the West for Japanese movies throughout the 1950s, replacing the enthusiasm for Italian neorealist cinema. By the end of 1952 Rashomon was released in Japan, the United States, and most of Europe. Among the Japanese film-makers whose work, as a result, began to win festival prizes and commercial release in the West were Kenji Mizoguchi (The Life of Oharu, Ugetsu, Sansho the Bailiff) and, somewhat later, Yasujir\u014d Ozu (Tokyo Story, An Autumn Afternoon)\u2014artists highly respected in Japan but, before this period, almost totally unknown in the West. Kurosawa's growing reputation among Western audiences in the 1950s would make Western audiences more sympathetic to the reception of later generations of Japanese film-makers ranging from Kon Ichikawa, Masaki Kobayashi, Nagisa Oshima and Shohei Imamura to Juzo Itami, Takeshi Kitano and Takashi Miike.\nHis career boosted by his sudden international fame, Kurosawa, now reunited with his original film studio, Toho (which would go on to produce his next 11 films), set to work on his next project, Ikiru. Based on Leo Tolstoy's The Death of Ivan Ilyich, the movie stars Takashi Shimura as a cancer-ridden Tokyo bureaucrat, Watanabe, on a final quest for meaning before his death. For the screenplay, Kurosawa brought in Hashimoto as well as writer Hideo Oguni, who would go on to co-write twelve Kurosawa films. Despite the work's grim subject matter, the screenwriters took a satirical approach, which some have compared to the work of Brecht, to both the bureaucratic world of its hero and the U.S. cultural colonization of Japan. (American pop songs figure prominently in the film.) Because of this strategy, the filmmakers are usually credited with saving the picture from the kind of sentimentality common to dramas about characters with terminal illnesses. Ikiru opened in October 1952 to rave reviews\u2014it won Kurosawa his second Kinema Junpo \"Best Film\" award\u2014and enormous box office success. It remains the most acclaimed of all the artist's films set in the modern era.\nIn December 1952, Kurosawa took his Ikiru screenwriters, Shinobu Hashimoto and Hideo Oguni, for a forty-five-day secluded residence at an inn to create the screenplay for his next movie, Seven Samurai. The ensemble work was Kurosawa's first proper samurai film, the genre for which he would become most famous. The simple story, about a poor farming village in Sengoku period Japan that hires a group of samurai to defend it against an impending attack by bandits, was given a full epic treatment, with a huge cast (largely consisting of veterans of previous Kurosawa productions) and meticulously detailed action, stretching out to almost three-and-a-half hours of screen time.\nThree months were spent in pre-production and a month in rehearsals. Shooting took up 148 days spread over almost a year, interrupted by production and financing troubles and Kurosawa's health problems. The film finally opened in April 1954, half a year behind its original release date and about three times over budget, making it at the time the most expensive Japanese film ever made. (However, by Hollywood standards, it was a quite modestly budgeted production, even for that time.) The film received positive critical reaction and became a big hit, quickly making back the money invested in it and providing the studio with a product that they could, and did, market internationally\u2014though with extensive edits. Over time\u2014and with the theatrical and home video releases of the uncut version\u2014its reputation has steadily grown. It is now regarded by some commentators as the greatest Japanese film ever made, and in 1999, a poll of Japanese film critics also voted it the best Japanese film ever made. In the most recent (2022) version of the widely respected British Film Institute (BFI) Sight & Sound \"Greatest Films of All Time\" poll, Seven Samurai placed 20th among all films from all countries in the critics' and tied at 14th in the directors' polls, receiving a place in the Top Ten lists of 48 critics and 22 directors.\nIn 1954, nuclear tests in the Pacific were causing radioactive rainstorms in Japan and one particular incident in March had exposed a Japanese fishing boat to nuclear fallout, with disastrous results. It is in this anxious atmosphere that Kurosawa's next film, I Live in Fear, was conceived. The story concerned an elderly factory owner (Toshiro Mifune) so terrified of the prospect of a nuclear attack that he becomes determined to move his entire extended family (both legal and extra-marital) to what he imagines is the safety of a farm in Brazil. Production went much more smoothly than the director's previous film, but a few days before shooting ended, Kurosawa's composer, collaborator, and close friend Fumio Hayasaka died (of tuberculosis) at the age of 41. The film's score was finished by Hayasaka's student, Masaru Sato, who would go on to score all of Kurosawa's next eight films. I Live in Fear opened in November 1955 to mixed reviews and muted audience reaction, becoming the first Kurosawa film to lose money during its original theatrical run. Today, it is considered by many to be among the finest films dealing with the psychological effects of the global nuclear stalemate.\nKurosawa's next project, Throne of Blood, an adaptation of William Shakespeare's Macbeth\u2014set, like Seven Samurai, in the Sengoku Era\u2014represented an ambitious transposition of the English work into a Japanese context. Kurosawa instructed his leading actress, Isuzu Yamada, to regard the work as if it were a cinematic version of a Japanese rather than a European literary classic. Given Kurosawa's appreciation of traditional Japanese stage acting, the acting of the players, particularly Yamada, draws heavily on the stylized techniques of the Noh theater. It was filmed in 1956 and released in January 1957 to a slightly less negative domestic response than had been the case with the director's previous film. Abroad, Throne of Blood, regardless of the liberties it takes with its source material, quickly earned a place among the most celebrated Shakespeare adaptations.\nAnother adaptation of a classic European theatrical work followed almost immediately, with production of The Lower Depths, based on a play by Maxim Gorky, taking place in May and June 1957. In contrast to the Shakespearean sweep of Throne of Blood, The Lower Depths was shot on only two confined sets, in order to emphasize the restricted nature of the characters' lives. Though faithful to the play, this adaptation of Russian material to a completely Japanese setting\u2014in this case, the late Edo period\u2014unlike his earlier The Idiot, was regarded as artistically successful. The film premiered in September 1957, receiving a mixed response similar to that of Throne of Blood. However, some critics rank it among the director's most underrated works.\nKurosawa's three next movies after Seven Samurai had not managed to capture Japanese audiences in the way that that film had. The mood of the director's work had been growing increasingly pessimistic and dark even as Japan entered a boom period of high-speed growth and rising standards of living. Out of step with the prevailing mood of the era, Kurosawa's films questioned the possibility of redemption through personal responsibility, particularly in Throne of Blood and The Lower Depths. He recognized this, and deliberately aimed for a more light-hearted and entertaining film for his next production while switching to the new widescreen format that had been gaining popularity in Japan. The resulting film, The Hidden Fortress, is an action-adventure comedy-drama about a medieval princess, her loyal general, and two peasants who all need to travel through enemy lines in order to reach their home region. Released in December 1958, The Hidden Fortress became an enormous box-office success in Japan and was warmly received by critics both in Japan and abroad. Today, the film is considered one of Kurosawa's most lightweight efforts, though it remains popular, not least because it is one of several major influences on George Lucas's 1977 space opera, Star Wars.\n\nBirth of a company and Red Beard (1959\u20131965)\nStarting with Rashomon, Kurosawa's productions had become increasingly large in scope and so had the director's budgets. Toho, concerned about this development, suggested that he might help finance his own works, therefore making the studio's potential losses smaller, while in turn allowing himself more artistic freedom as co-producer. Kurosawa agreed, and the Kurosawa Production Company was established in April 1959, with Toho as the majority shareholder.\nDespite risking his own money, Kurosawa chose a story that was more directly critical of the Japanese business and political elites than any previous work. The Bad Sleep Well, based on a script by Kurosawa's nephew Mike Inoue, is a revenge drama about a young man who is able to infiltrate the hierarchy of a corrupt Japanese company with the intention of exposing the men responsible for his father's death. Its theme proved topical: while the film was in production, the massive Anpo protests were held against the new U.S.\u2013Japan Security treaty, which was seen by many Japanese, particularly the young, as threatening the country's democracy by giving too much power to corporations and politicians. The film opened in September 1960 to positive critical reaction and modest box office success. The 25-minute opening sequence depicting a corporate wedding reception is widely regarded as one of Kurosawa's most skillfully executed set pieces, but the remainder of the film is often perceived as disappointing by comparison. The movie has also been criticized for employing the conventional Kurosawan hero to combat a social evil that cannot be resolved through the actions of individuals, however courageous or cunning.\nYojimbo (The Bodyguard), Kurosawa Production's second film, centers on a masterless samurai, Sanjuro, who strolls into a 19th-century town ruled by two opposing violent factions and provokes them into destroying each other. The director used this work to play with many genre conventions, particularly the Western, while at the same time offering an unprecedentedly (for the Japanese screen) graphic portrayal of violence. Some commentators have seen the Sanjuro character in this film as a fantasy figure who magically reverses the historical triumph of the corrupt merchant class over the samurai class. Featuring Tatsuya Nakadai in his first major role in a Kurosawa movie, and with innovative photography by Kazuo Miyagawa (who shot Rashomon) and Takao Saito, the film premiered in April 1961 and was a critically and commercially successful venture, earning more than any previous Kurosawa film. The movie and its blackly comic tone were also widely imitated abroad. Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars was a virtual (unauthorized) scene-by-scene remake with Toho filing a lawsuit on Kurosawa's behalf and prevailing.\n\nFollowing the success of Yojimbo, Kurosawa found himself under pressure from Toho to create a sequel. Kurosawa turned to a script he had written before Yojimbo, reworking it to include the hero of his previous film. Sanjuro was the first of three Kurosawa films to be adapted from the work of the writer Sh\u016bgor\u014d Yamamoto (the others would be Red Beard and Dodeskaden). It is lighter in tone and closer to a conventional period film than Yojimbo, though its story of a power struggle within a samurai clan is portrayed with strongly comic undertones. The film opened on January 1, 1962, quickly surpassing Yojimbo's box office success and garnering positive reviews.\nKurosawa had meanwhile instructed Toho to purchase the film rights to King's Ransom, a novel about a kidnapping written by American author and screenwriter Evan Hunter, under his pseudonym of Ed McBain, as one of his 87th Precinct series of crime books. The director intended to create a work condemning kidnapping, which he considered one of the very worst crimes. The suspense film, titled High and Low, was shot during the latter half of 1962 and released in March 1963. It broke Kurosawa's box office record (the third film in a row to do so), became the highest grossing Japanese film of the year, and won glowing reviews. However, his triumph was somewhat tarnished when, ironically, the film was blamed for a wave of kidnappings which occurred in Japan about this time (he himself received kidnapping threats directed at his young daughter, Kazuko). High and Low is considered by many commentators to be among the director's strongest works.\nKurosawa quickly moved on to his next project, Red Beard. Based on a short story collection by Sh\u016bgor\u014d Yamamoto and incorporating elements from Dostoevsky's novel The Insulted and Injured, it is a period film, set in a mid-nineteenth century clinic for the poor, in which Kurosawa's humanist themes receive perhaps their fullest statement. A conceited and materialistic, foreign-trained young doctor, Yasumoto, is forced to become an intern at the clinic under the stern tutelage of Doctor Niide, known as \"Akahige\" (\"Red Beard\"), played by Mifune. Although he resists Red Beard initially, Yasumoto comes to admire his wisdom and courage and to perceive the patients at the clinic, whom he at first despised, as worthy of compassion and dignity.\nY\u016bz\u014d Kayama, who plays Yasumoto, was an extremely popular film and music star at the time, particularly for his \"Young Guy\" (Wakadaish\u014d) series of musical comedies, so signing him to appear in the film virtually guaranteed Kurosawa strong box-office. The shoot, the filmmaker's longest ever, lasted well over a year (after five months of pre-production), and wrapped in spring 1965, leaving the director, his crew and his actors exhausted. Red Beard premiered in April 1965, becoming the year's highest-grossing Japanese production and the third (and last) Kurosawa film to top the prestigious Kinema Jumpo yearly critics poll. It remains one of Kurosawa's best-known and most-loved works in his native country. Outside Japan, critics have been much more divided. Most commentators concede its technical merits and some praise it as among Kurosawa's best, while others insist that it lacks complexity and genuine narrative power, with still others claiming that it represents a retreat from the artist's previous commitment to social and political change.\nThe film marked something of an end of an era for its creator. The director himself recognized this at the time of its release, telling critic Donald Richie that a cycle of some kind had just come to an end and that his future films and production methods would be different. His prediction proved quite accurate. Beginning in the late 1950s, television began increasingly to dominate the leisure time of the formerly large and loyal Japanese cinema audience. And as film company revenues dropped, so did their appetite for risk\u2014particularly the risk represented by Kurosawa's costly production methods.\nRed Beard also marked the midway point, chronologically, in the artist's career. During his previous twenty-nine years in the film industry (which includes his five years as assistant director), he had directed twenty-three films, while during the remaining twenty-eight years, for many complex reasons, he would complete only seven more. Also, for reasons never adequately explained, Red Beard would be his final film starring Toshiro Mifune. Y\u016b Fujiki, an actor who worked on The Lower Depths, observed, regarding the closeness of the two men on the set, \"Mr. Kurosawa's heart was in Mr. Mifune's body.\" Donald Richie has described the rapport between them as a unique \"symbiosis\".\n\nHollywood ambitions to last films (1966\u20131998)\nHollywood detour (1966\u20131968)\nWhen Kurosawa's exclusive contract with Toho came to an end in 1966, the 56-year-old director was seriously contemplating change. Observing the troubled state of the domestic film industry, and having already received dozens of offers from abroad, the idea of working outside Japan appealed to him as never before.\nFor his first foreign project, Kurosawa chose a story based on a Life magazine article. The Embassy Pictures action thriller, to be filmed in English and called simply Runaway Train, would have been his first in color. But the language barrier proved a major problem, and the English version of the screenplay was not even finished by the time filming was to begin in autumn 1966. The shoot, which required snow, was moved to autumn 1967, then canceled in 1968. Almost two decades later, another foreign director working in Hollywood, Andrei Konchalovsky, finally made Runaway Train (1985), though from a new script loosely based on Kurosawa's.\nThe director meanwhile had become involved in a much more ambitious Hollywood project. Tora! Tora! Tora!, produced by 20th Century Fox and Kurosawa Production, would be a portrayal of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor from both the American and the Japanese points of view, with Kurosawa helming the Japanese half and an Anglophonic film-maker directing the American half. He spent several months working on the script with Ryuzo Kikushima and Hideo Oguni, but very soon the project began to unravel. The director of the American sequences turned out not to be David Lean, as originally planned, but American Richard Fleischer. The budget was also cut, and the screen time allocated for the Japanese segment would now be no longer than 90 minutes\u2014a major problem, considering that Kurosawa's script ran over four hours. After numerous revisions with the direct involvement of Darryl Zanuck, a more or less finalized cut screenplay was agreed upon in May 1968.\nShooting began in early December, but Kurosawa would last only a little over three weeks as director. He struggled to work with an unfamiliar crew and the requirements of a Hollywood production, while his working methods puzzled his American producers, who ultimately concluded that the director must be mentally ill. Kurosawa was examined at Kyoto University Hospital by a neuropsychologist, Dr. Murakami, whose diagnosis was forwarded to Darryl Zanuck and Richard Zanuck at Fox studios indicating a diagnosis of neurasthenia stating that, \"He is suffering from disturbance of sleep, agitated with feelings of anxiety and in manic excitement caused by the above mentioned illness. It is necessary for him to have rest and medical treatment for more than two months.\" On Christmas Eve 1968, the Americans announced that Kurosawa had left the production due to \"fatigue\", effectively firing him. He was ultimately replaced, for the film's Japanese sequences, with two directors, Kinji Fukasaku and Toshio Masuda.\nTora! Tora! Tora!, finally released to unenthusiastic reviews in September 1970, was, as Donald Richie put it, an \"almost unmitigated tragedy\" in Kurosawa's career. He had spent years of his life on a logistically nightmarish project to which he ultimately did not contribute a foot of film shot by himself. (He had his name removed from the credits, though the script used for the Japanese half was still his and his co-writers'.) He became estranged from his longtime collaborator, writer Ryuzo Kikushima, and never worked with him again. The project had inadvertently exposed corruption in his own production company (a situation reminiscent of his own movie, The Bad Sleep Well). His very sanity had been called into question. Worst of all, the Japanese film industry\u2014and perhaps Kurosawa himself\u2014began to suspect that he would never make another film.\n\nA difficult decade (1969\u20131977)\nKnowing that his reputation was at stake following the much publicised Tora! Tora! Tora! debacle, Kurosawa moved quickly to a new project to prove he was still viable. To his aid came friends and famed directors Keisuke Kinoshita, Masaki Kobayashi and Kon Ichikawa, who together with Kurosawa established in July 1969 a production company called the Club of the Four Knights (Yonki no kai). Although the plan was for the four directors to create a film each, it has been suggested that the real motivation for the other three directors was to make it easier for Kurosawa to successfully complete a film, and therefore find his way back into the business.\nThe first project proposed and worked on was a period film to be called Dora-heita, but when this was deemed too expensive, attention shifted to Dodesukaden, an adaptation of yet another Sh\u016bgor\u014d Yamamoto work, again about the poor and destitute. The film was shot quickly (by Kurosawa's standards) in about nine weeks, with Kurosawa determined to show he was still capable of working quickly and efficiently within a limited budget. For his first work in color, the dynamic editing and complex compositions of his earlier pictures were set aside, with the artist focusing on the creation of a bold, almost surreal palette of primary colors, in order to reveal the toxic environment in which the characters live. It was released in Japan in October 1970, but though a minor critical success, it was greeted with audience indifference. The picture lost money and caused the Club of the Four Knights to dissolve. Initial reception abroad was somewhat more favorable, but Dodesukaden has since been typically considered an interesting experiment not comparable to the director's best work.\nAfter struggling through the production of Dodesukaden, Kurosawa turned to television work the following year for the only time in his career with Song of the Horse, a documentary about thoroughbred race horses. It featured a voice-over narrated by a fictional man and a child (voiced by the same actors as the beggar and his son in Dodesukaden). It is the only documentary in Kurosawa's filmography; the small crew included his frequent collaborator Masaru Sato, who composed the music. Song of the Horse is also unique in Kurosawa's oeuvre in that it includes an editor's credit, suggesting that it is the only Kurosawa film that he did not cut himself.\nUnable to secure funding for further work and allegedly having health problems, Kurosawa apparently reached the breaking point: on December 22, 1971, he slit his wrists and throat multiple times. The suicide attempt proved unsuccessful and the director's health recovered fairly quickly, with Kurosawa now taking refuge in domestic life, uncertain if he would ever direct another film.\nIn early 1973, the Soviet studio Mosfilm approached the film-maker to ask if he would be interested in working with them. Kurosawa proposed an adaptation of Russian explorer Vladimir Arsenyev's autobiographical work Dersu Uzala. The book, about a Goldi hunter who lives in harmony with nature until destroyed by encroaching civilization, was one that he had wanted to make since the 1930s. In December 1973, the 63-year-old Kurosawa set off for the Soviet Union with four of his closest aides, beginning a year-and-a-half stay in the country. Shooting began in May 1974 in Siberia, with filming in exceedingly harsh natural conditions proving very difficult and demanding. The picture wrapped in April 1975, with a thoroughly exhausted and homesick Kurosawa returning to Japan and his family in June. Dersu Uzala had its world premiere in Japan on August 2, 1975, and did well at the box office. While critical reception in Japan was muted, the film was better reviewed abroad, winning the Golden Prize at the 9th Moscow International Film Festival, as well as an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Today, critics remain divided over the film: some see it as an example of Kurosawa's alleged artistic decline, while others count it among his finest works.\nAlthough proposals for television projects were submitted to him, he had no interest in working outside the film world. Nevertheless, the hard-drinking director did agree to appear in a series of television ads for Suntory whiskey, which aired in 1976. While fearing that he might never be able to make another film, the director nevertheless continued working on various projects, writing scripts and creating detailed illustrations, intending to leave behind a visual record of his plans in case he would never be able to film his stories.\n\nTwo epics (1978\u20131986)\nIn 1977, George Lucas released Star Wars, a wildly successful science fiction film influenced by Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress. Lucas, like many other New Hollywood directors, revered Kurosawa and considered him a role model, and was shocked to discover that the Japanese film-maker was unable to secure financing for any new work. The two met in San Francisco in July 1978 to discuss the project Kurosawa considered most financially viable: Kagemusha, the epic story of a thief hired as the double of a medieval Japanese lord of a great clan. Lucas, enthralled by the screenplay and Kurosawa's illustrations, leveraged his influence over 20th Century Fox to coerce the studio that had fired Kurosawa just ten years earlier to produce Kagemusha, then recruited fellow fan Francis Ford Coppola as co-producer.\nProduction began the following April, with Kurosawa in high spirits. Shooting lasted from June 1979 through March 1980 and was plagued with problems, not the least of which was the firing of the original lead actor, Shintaro Katsu\u2014known for portraying the popular character Zatoichi\u2014due to an incident in which the actor insisted, against the director's wishes, on videotaping his own performance. (He was replaced by Tatsuya Nakadai, in his first of two consecutive leading roles in a Kurosawa movie.) The film was completed only a few weeks behind schedule and opened in Tokyo in April 1980. It quickly became a massive hit in Japan. The film was also a critical and box office success abroad, winning the coveted Palme d'Or at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival in May, though some critics, then and now, have faulted the film for its alleged coldness. Kurosawa spent much of the rest of the year in Europe and America promoting Kagemusha, collecting awards and accolades, and exhibiting as art the drawings he had made to serve as storyboards for the film.\n\nThe international success of Kagemusha allowed Kurosawa to proceed with his next project, Ran, another epic in a similar vein. The script, partly based on Shakespeare's King Lear, depicted a ruthless, bloodthirsty daimy\u014d (warlord), played by Tatsuya Nakadai, who, after foolishly banishing his one loyal son, surrenders his kingdom to his other two sons, who then betray him, thus plunging the entire kingdom into war. As Japanese studios still felt wary about producing another film that would rank among the most expensive ever made in the country, international help was again needed. This time it came from French producer Serge Silberman, who had produced Luis Bu\u00f1uel's final movies. Filming did not begin until December 1983 and lasted more than a year.\nIn January 1985, production of Ran was halted as Kurosawa's 64-year-old wife Y\u014dko fell ill. She died on February 1. Kurosawa returned to finish his film and Ran premiered at the Tokyo Film Festival on May 31, with a wide release the next day. The film was a moderate financial success in Japan, but a larger one abroad and, as he had done with Kagemusha, Kurosawa embarked on a trip to Europe and America, where he attended the film's premieres in September and October.\nRan won several awards in Japan, but was not quite as honored there as many of the director's best films of the 1950s and 1960s had been. The film world was surprised, however, when Japan passed over the selection of Ran in favor of another film as its official entry to compete for an Oscar nomination in the Best Foreign Film category, which was ultimately rejected for competition at the 58th Academy Awards. Both the producer and Kurosawa himself attributed the failure to even submit Ran for competition to a misunderstanding: because of the academy's arcane rules, no one was sure whether Ran qualified as a Japanese film, a French film (due to its financing), or both, so it was not submitted at all. In response to what at least appeared to be a blatant snub by his own countrymen, the director Sidney Lumet led a successful campaign to have Kurosawa receive an Oscar nomination for Best Director that year (Sydney Pollack ultimately won the award for directing Out of Africa). Ran's costume designer, Emi Wada, won the movie's only Oscar.\nKagemusha and Ran, particularly the latter, are often considered to be among Kurosawa's finest works. After Ran's release, Kurosawa would point to it as his best film, a major change of attitude for the director who, when asked which of his works was his best, had always previously answered \"my next one\".\n\nFinal works and last years (1987\u20131998)\nFor his next movie, Kurosawa chose a subject very different from any that he had ever filmed before. While some of his previous pictures (for example, Drunken Angel and Kagemusha) had included brief dream sequences, Dreams was to be entirely based upon the director's own dreams. Significantly, for the first time in over forty years, Kurosawa, for this deeply personal project, wrote the screenplay alone. Although its estimated budget was lower than the films immediately preceding it, Japanese studios were still unwilling to back one of his productions, so Kurosawa turned to another famous American fan, Steven Spielberg, who convinced Warner Bros. to buy the international rights to the completed film. This made it easier for Kurosawa's son, Hisao, as co-producer and soon-to-be head of Kurosawa Production, to negotiate a loan in Japan that would cover the film's production costs. Shooting took more than eight months to complete, and Dreams premiered at Cannes in May 1990 to a polite but muted reception, similar to the reaction the picture would generate elsewhere in the world. In 1990, he accepted the Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement. In his acceptance speech, he famously said \"I'm a little worried because I don't feel that I understand cinema yet.\" At the time, Bob Thomas of The Daily Spectrum noted that Kurosawa was \"considered by many critics as the greatest living filmmaker.\"\n\nKurosawa now turned to a more conventional story with Rhapsody in August\u2014the director's first film fully produced in Japan since Dodeskaden over twenty years before\u2014which explored the scars of the nuclear bombing which destroyed Nagasaki at the very end of World War II. It was adapted from a Kiyoko Murata novel, but the film's references to the Nagasaki bombing came from the director rather than from the book. This was his only movie to include a role for an American movie star: Richard Gere, who plays a small role as the nephew of the elderly heroine. Shooting took place in early 1991, with the film opening on May 25 that year to a largely negative critical reaction, especially in the United States, where the director was accused of promulgating na\u00efvely anti-American sentiments, though Kurosawa rejected these accusations.\nKurosawa wasted no time moving onto his next project: Madadayo, or Not Yet. Based on autobiographical essays by Hyakken Uchida, the film follows the life of a Japanese professor of German through the Second World War and beyond. The narrative centers on yearly birthday celebrations with his former students, during which the protagonist declares his unwillingness to die just yet\u2014a theme that was becoming increasingly relevant for the film's 81-year-old creator. Filming began in February 1992 and wrapped by the end of September. Its release on April 17, 1993, was greeted by an even more disappointed reaction than had been the case with his two preceding works.\nKurosawa nevertheless continued to work. He wrote the original screenplays The Sea is Watching in 1993 and After the Rain in 1995. While putting finishing touches on the latter work in 1995, Kurosawa slipped and broke the base of his spine. Following the accident, he would use a wheelchair for the rest of his life, putting an end to any hopes of him directing another film. His longtime wish\u2014to die on the set while shooting a movie\u2014was never to be fulfilled.\nAfter his accident, Kurosawa's health began to deteriorate. While his mind remained sharp and lively, his body was giving up, and for the last half-year of his life, the director was largely confined to bed, listening to music and watching television at home. On September 6, 1998, Kurosawa died of a stroke in Setagaya, Tokyo, at the age of 88. At the time of his death, Kurosawa had two children, his son Hisao Kurosawa who married Hiroko Hayashi and his daughter Kazuko Kurosawa who married Harayuki Kato, along with several grandchildren. One of his grandchildren, the actor Takayuki Kato and grandson by Kazuko, became a supporting actor in two films posthumously developed from screenplays written by Kurosawa which remained unproduced during his own lifetime, Takashi Koizumi's After the Rain (1999) and Kei Kumai's The Sea is Watching (2002).\n\nFilmography\nAlthough Kurosawa is primarily known as a filmmaker, he also worked in theater and television and wrote books. A detailed list, including his complete filmography, can be found in the list of works by Akira Kurosawa.\n\nStyle, themes and techniques\nKurosawa displayed a bold, dynamic style, strongly influenced by Western cinema yet distinct from it; he was involved with all aspects of film production. He was a gifted screenwriter and worked closely with his co-writers from the film's development onward to ensure a high-quality script, which he considered the firm foundation of a good film. He frequently served as editor of his own films. His team, known as the \"Kurosawa-gumi\" (\u9ed2\u6fa4\u7d44, Kurosawa group), which included the cinematographer Asakazu Nakai, the production assistant Teruyo Nogami and the actor Takashi Shimura, was notable for its loyalty and dependability.\nKurosawa's style is marked by a number of devices and techniques. In his films of the 1940s and 1950s, he frequently employs the \"axial cut\", in which the camera moves toward or away from the subject through a series of matched jump cuts rather than tracking shots or dissolves. Another stylistic trait is \"cut on motion\", which displays the motion on the screen in two or more shots instead of one uninterrupted one. A form of cinematic punctuation strongly identified with Kurosawa is the wipe, an effect created through an optical printer: a line or bar appears to move across the screen, wiping away the end of a scene and revealing the first image of the next. As a transitional device, it is used as a substitute for the straight cut or the dissolve; in his mature work, the wipe became Kurosawa's signature.\nIn the film's soundtrack, Kurosawa favored the sound-image counterpoint, in which the music or sound effects appeared to comment ironically on the image rather than emphasizing it. Teruyo Nogami's memoir gives several such examples from Drunken Angel and Stray Dog. Kurosawa was also involved with several of Japan's outstanding contemporary composers, including Fumio Hayasaka and T\u014dru Takemitsu.\n\nKurosawa employed a number of recurring themes in his films: the master-disciple relationship between a usually older mentor and one or more novices, which often involves spiritual as well as technical mastery and self-mastery; the heroic champion, the exceptional individual who emerges from the mass of people to produce something or right some wrong; the depiction of extremes of weather as both dramatic devices and symbols of human passion; and the recurrence of cycles of savage violence within history. According to Stephen Prince, the last theme, which he calls, \"the countertradition to the committed, heroic mode of Kurosawa's cinema,\" began with Throne of Blood (1957), and recurred in the films of the 1980s.\n\nLegacy and cultural impact\nKurosawa is often cited as one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. In 1999, he was named \"Asian of the Century\" in the \"Arts, Literature, and Culture\" category by AsianWeek magazine and CNN, cited as \"one of the [five] people who contributed most to the betterment of Asia in the past 100 years\". Kurosawa was ranked third in the directors' poll and fifth in the critics' poll in Sight & Sound's 2002 list of the greatest directors of all time. In commemoration of the 100th anniversary of Kurosawa's birth in 2010, a project called AK100 was launched in 2008. The AK100 Project aims to \"expose young people who are the representatives of the next generation, and all people everywhere, to the light and spirit of Akira Kurosawa and the wonderful world he created\".\n\nReputation among filmmakers\nMany filmmakers have been influenced by Kurosawa's work. Ingmar Bergman called his own film The Virgin Spring a \"touristic... lousy imitation of Kurosawa\", and added, \"At that time my admiration for the Japanese cinema was at its height. I was almost a samurai myself!\" Federico Fellini considered Kurosawa to be \"the greatest living example of all that an author of the cinema should be\". Steven Spielberg cited Kurosawa's cinematic vision as shaping his own. Satyajit Ray, who was posthumously awarded the Akira Kurosawa Award for Lifetime Achievement in Directing at the San Francisco International Film Festival in 1992, had said earlier of Rashomon: The effect of the film on me [upon first seeing it in Calcutta in 1952] was electric. I saw it three times on consecutive days, and wondered each time if there was another film anywhere which gave such sustained and dazzling proof of a director's command over every aspect of film making.\nRoman Polanski considered Kurosawa to be among the three film-makers he favored most, along with Fellini and Orson Welles, and picked Seven Samurai, Throne of Blood and The Hidden Fortress for praise. Bernardo Bertolucci considered Kurosawa's influence to be seminal: \"Kurosawa's movies and La Dolce Vita of Fellini are the things that pushed me, sucked me into being a film director.\" Andrei Tarkovsky cited Kurosawa as one of his favorites and named Seven Samurai as one of his ten favorite films. Sidney Lumet called Kurosawa the \"Beethoven of movie directors\". Werner Herzog reflected on film-makers with whom he feels kinship and the movies that he admires:\n\nGriffith \u2013 especially his Birth of a Nation and Broken Blossoms \u2013  Murnau,  Bu\u00f1uel, Kurosawa and Eisenstein's Ivan the Terrible, ... all come to mind. ... I like Dreyer's The Passion of Joan of Arc, Pudovkin's Storm Over Asia and Dovzhenko's Earth, ...  Mizoguchi's Ugetsu Monogatari, Satyajit Ray's The Music Room ... I have always wondered how Kurosawa made something as good as Rashomon; the equilibrium and flow are perfect, and he uses space in such a well-balanced way. It is one of the best films ever made.\nAccording to an assistant, Stanley Kubrick considered Kurosawa to be \"one of the great film directors\" and spoke of him \"consistently and admiringly\", to the point that a letter from him \"meant more than any Oscar\" and caused him to agonize for months over drafting a reply. Robert Altman upon first seeing Rashomon was so impressed by the sequence of frames of the sun that he began to shoot the same sequences in his work the very next day, he claimed. George Lucas cited The Hidden Fortress as the main inspiration for Star Wars. He also cited other films of Kurosawa as his favorites including Seven Samurai, Yojimbo, and Ikiru. He also said, \"I had never seen anything that powerful or cinematographic. The emotions were so strong that it didn't matter that I did not understand the culture or the traditions. From that moment on, Kurosawa's films have served as one of my strongest sources of creative inspiration.\" Wes Anderson's animated film Isle of Dogs is partially inspired by Kurosawa's filming techniques. At the 64th Sydney Film Festival, there was a retrospective of Akira Kurosawa where films of his were screened to remember the great legacy he has created from his work. Zack Snyder cited him as one of his influences for his Netflix film Rebel Moon.\n\nCriticism\nKenji Mizoguchi, the acclaimed director of Ugetsu (1953) and Sansho the Bailiff (1954), was eleven years Kurosawa's senior. After the mid-1950s, some critics of the French New Wave began to favor Mizoguchi over Kurosawa. New Wave critic and film-maker Jacques Rivette, in particular, thought Mizoguchi to be the only Japanese director whose work was at once entirely Japanese and truly universal; Kurosawa, by contrast, was thought to be more influenced by Western cinema and culture, a view that has been disputed.\n\nIn Japan, some critics and filmmakers considered Kurosawa to be elitist. They viewed him to center his effort and attention on exceptional or heroic characters. In her DVD commentary on Seven Samurai, Joan Mellen argued that certain shots of the samurai characters Kambei and Kyuzo, which show Kurosawa to have accorded higher status or validity to them, constitutes evidence for this point of view. These Japanese critics argued that Kurosawa was not sufficiently progressive because the peasants were unable to find leaders from within their ranks. In an interview with Mellen, Kurosawa defended himself, saying, I wanted to say that after everything the peasants were the stronger, closely clinging to the earth ... It was the samurai who were weak because they were being blown by the winds of time.\nFrom the early 1950s, Kurosawa was also charged with catering to Western tastes due to his popularity in Europe and America. In the 1970s, the politically engaged, left-wing director Nagisa \u014cshima, who was noted for his critical reaction to Kurosawa's work, accused Kurosawa of pandering to Western beliefs and ideologies. Author Audie Block, however, assessed Kurosawa to have never played up to a non-Japanese viewing public and to have denounced those directors who did.\n\nPosthumous screenplays\nFollowing Kurosawa's death, several posthumous works based on his unfilmed screenplays have been produced. After the Rain, directed by Takashi Koizumi, was released in 1999, and The Sea Is Watching, directed by Kei Kumai, premiered in 2002. A script created by the Yonki no Kai (\"Club of the Four Knights\") (Kurosawa, Keisuke Kinoshita, Masaki Kobayashi, and Kon Ichikawa), around the time that Dodeskaden was made, finally was filmed and released (in 2000) as Dora-heita, by the only surviving founding member of the club, Kon Ichikawa. Huayi Brothers Media and CKF Pictures in China announced in 2017 plans to produce a film of Kurosawa's posthumous screenplay of The Masque of the Red Death by Edgar Allan Poe for 2020, to be entitled The Mask of the Black Death. Patrick Frater writing for Variety magazine in May 2017 stated that another two unfinished films by Kurosawa were planned, with Silvering Spear to start filming in 2018.\n\nKurosawa Production Company\nIn September 2011, it was reported that remake rights to most of Kurosawa's movies and unproduced screenplays were assigned by the Akira Kurosawa 100 Project to the L.A.-based company Splendent. Splendent's chief Sakiko Yamada, stated that he aimed to \"help contemporary film-makers introduce a new generation of moviegoers to these unforgettable stories\".\nKurosawa Production Co., established in 1959, continues to oversee many of the aspects of Kurosawa's legacy. The director's son, Hisao Kurosawa, is the current head of the company. Its American subsidiary, Kurosawa Enterprises, is located in Los Angeles. Rights to Kurosawa's works were then held by Kurosawa Production and the film studios under which he worked, most notably Toho. These rights were then assigned to the Akira Kurosawa 100 Project before being reassigned in 2011 to the L.A. based company Splendent. Kurosawa Production works closely with the Akira Kurosawa Foundation, established in December 2003 and also run by Hisao Kurosawa. The foundation organizes an annual short film competition and spearheads Kurosawa-related projects, including a recently shelved one to build a memorial museum for the director.\n\nFilm studios\nIn 1981, the Kurosawa Film Studio was opened in Yokohama; two additional locations have since been launched in Japan. A large collection of archive material, including scanned screenplays, photos and news articles, has been made available through the Akira Kurosawa Digital Archive, a Japanese proprietary website maintained by Ryukoku University Digital Archives Research Center in collaboration with Kurosawa Production.\n\nAnaheim University Akira Kurosawa School of Film\nAnaheim University in collaboration with Kurosawa Production and the Kurosawa family established the Anaheim University Akira Kurosawa School of Film in spring 2009. The Anaheim University Akira Kurosawa School of Film offers an Online Master of Fine Arts (MFA) in Digital Filmmaking supported by many of the world's greatest filmmakers.\n\nKurosawa Restaurant Group\nKurosawa was known to be a connoisseur of Japanese cuisine and as such, the Kurosawa family foundation established the Kurosawa Restaurant Group after his passing in 1999, opening four restaurants in the Tokyo area bearing the family name. Nagatacho Kurosawa specializing in Shabu-shabu, Teppanyaki Kurosawa in Tsukiji specializing in Teppanyaki, Keyaki Kurosawa in Nishi-Azabu specializing in soba, and Udon Kurosawa specializing in udon in Roppongi. All four locations were designed to evoke the Meiji era machiya of Kurosawa's youth and feature memorabilia of Kurosawa's career. As of 2023, only the Tsukiji location is currently still operating. A number of entrepreneurs around the world have also opened restaurants and businesses in honor of Kurosawa without any connection to Akira or the estate.\n\nAwards and honors\nTwo film awards have also been named in Kurosawa's honor. The Akira Kurosawa Award for Lifetime Achievement in Film Directing is awarded during the San Francisco International Film Festival, while the Akira Kurosawa Award is given during the Tokyo International Film Festival.\nKurosawa has also been given a number of state honors, including being named as an officer of the French L\u00e9gion d'honneur in 1984, a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic in 1986, and was the first filmmaker to receive the Order of Culture from his native Japan in 1985. Posthumously, he was recognized with the Junior Third Court Rank, which would be the modern equivalent of a noble title under the Kazoku aristocracy.\n\nDocumentaries\nA significant number of short and full-length documentaries concerning the life and work of Kurosawa were made both during his artistic heyday and after his death. AK, by French video essay director Chris Marker, was filmed while Kurosawa was working on Ran; however, the documentary is more concerned about Kurosawa's distant yet polite personality than on the making of the film. Other documentaries concerning Kurosawa's life and works produced posthumously include:\n\nKurosawa: The Last Emperor (Alex Cox, 1999)\nA Message from Akira Kurosawa: For Beautiful Movies (Hisao Kurosawa, 2000)\nKurosawa (Adam Low, 2001)\nAkira Kurosawa: It Is Wonderful to Create (Toho Masterworks, 2002)\nAkira Kurosawa: The Epic and the Intimate (2010)\nKurosawa's Way (Catherine Cadou, 2011)\n\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\nFurther reading\nExternal links\n\nAkira Kurosawa at IMDb\nAkira Kurosawa at the TCM Movie Database \nAkira Kurosawa at The Criterion Collection\nAkira Kurosawa: News, Information and Discussion\nSenses of Cinema: Great Directors Critical Database\nAkira Kurosawa at Japanese celebrity's grave guide (in Japanese)\nAkira Kurosawa at the Japanese Movie Database (in Japanese)\nSeveral trailers\nAnaheim University Akira Kurosawa School of Film\nAkira Kurosawa at Rotten Tomatoes","18":"AllMovie (previously All Movie Guide) is an online database with information about films, television programs, television series, and screen actors.

Her father talks her into returning to her marital home, as her parents' welfare and the career of her brother depend on the marriage, also reminding her that she will have to leave her young son behind. On her way back home in a rickshaw, she discovers that the driver is Rokunosuke, a childhood friend who never got over their separation. They reminisce their once mutual affection, but part ways without an outlook to meeting again.\nEpisode 2: \"On The Last Day Of The Year\": Mine works as a maid in the strict household of Mrs. Yamamura, wife of a wealthy businessman. To help her sick uncle who is in debt, Mine asks her employer to lend her money. Mrs. Yamamura first agrees, but later withdraws her offer. Out of desperation, Mine steals money from a household drawer and gives it to her aunt. Moments before her misdemeanour is revealed, Mrs. Yamamura's carefree son Ishinosuke takes the remaining money to waste it on gambling and drinking, thus obliterating all traces of Mine's theft.\nEpisode 3: \"Troubled Waters\": Courtesan O-Riki is the \"star\" of a brothel in a red light district. To her disapproval, she is still being followed by her impoverished former patron Genshichi who spent all his money on her. O-Riki gets involved with a new client, Asanosuke, but is reluctant to the possible prospect of marriage, citing her profession and her poor upbringing as reasons. Meanwhile, Genshichi forces his wife and little son to leave him due to her constant complaints that he is unable to support the family.

It stars Rajesh Khanna in the lead role, with a supporting cast including Amitabh Bachchan, Sumita Sanyal, Ramesh Deo and Seema Deo.\nThe film won several awards, including the Filmfare Award for Best Film in 1972. In 2013, it was listed in Anupama Chopra's book 100 Films To See before You Die. Anand is counted among the 17 consecutive box office successes of Rajesh Khanna between 1969 and 1971, adding the multistarrers Maryada (1971) and Andaz (1971). The film was a modest success at box office. It has since gained a cult following     , being hailed as one of the greatest Hindi films ever made. Indiatimes listed it among the \"25 must watch films Bollywood movies\". Anand is one of the only two films that Khanna and Bachchan have starred together\u2013 the other being the 1973 film Namak Haraam, which was also directed by Hrishikesh Mukherjee.\n\nPlot\nAt an award ceremony in Mumbai for his first book, 'Anand', Dr. Bhaskar Banerjee is asked to speak about the book. Bhaskar says that the book has been written based on his diary excerpts when he met Anand and narrates to the audience his experience with him.\nBhaskar, an oncologist, treats the poor for no charge but is often disheartened by the fact that he cannot cure all the ailments in the world. He becomes pessimistic after seeing the suffering, illness, and poverty all around him. He is straightforward and will not treat the imaginary ailments of the rich. His friend, Dr. Prakash Kulkarni, follows a slightly different path. He treats the imaginary illnesses of the rich and uses that money to treat the poor.\nOne day, Kulkarni introduces Bhaskar to Anand, who has lymphosarcoma of the intestine, a rare type of cancer. Anand has a cheerful nature and despite knowing that he is not going to survive for more than six months, he maintains a nonchalant demeanor and always tries to make everyone around him happy. His cheerful and vibrant nature soothes Bhaskar, who has a contrasting nature and they become good friends. \nAnand has the rare quality of attracting people and befriending them. In one such encounter, he makes Isa Bhai, a theater actor, his friend. They enjoy each other's company and create an emotional bond.\nAnand's condition gradually deteriorates, but he does not want to spend his remaining days in a hospital bed; he, instead, roams free and helps everyone. He discovers that Bhaskar has strong feelings for Renu, whom he had treated previously for pneumonia. He helps Bhaskar express his love and convinces Renu's mother to bless their marriage. He tells Bhaskar that everyone should remember him as a lively person and not as a cancer patient. It is also discovered that he loved a girl back in Delhi who is now married to someone else because of Anand's illness. The day she got married, Anand came to Mumbai from Delhi to move on from her but keeps a flower in his book in her memory. Anand becomes sicker with time and is now bound to the house. He records Bhasker saying a poem and himself delivering dialogue and both of them laughing together on tape. He is counting his last breaths as his friends gather around him but Bhasker is gone to bring medicines for him. He shouts for him and dies. Bhasker comes back just a few minutes later and begs Anand to speak to him. Suddenly, the tape starts playing with Anand's voice and his friends cry for him. A couple of balloons are seen flying away in the sky as Anand leaves the world and flies away in the sky.\n\nCast\nRajesh Khanna as Anand Sehgal\nAmitabh Bachchan as Dr. Bhaskar Banerjee a.k.a. Babu Moshai \/ Munna\nSumita Sanyal as Renu Bhaskar Banerjee\nRamesh Deo as Dr. Prakash Kulkarni\nSeema Deo as Suman Kulkarni\nLalita Pawar as Matron D'Sa\nDurga Khote as Renu's mother\nJohnny Walker as Isa Bhai Suratwala \/ Morarilal\nAsit Sen as Chandra Nath\nDev Kishan as Raghu Kaka\nDara Singh as Wrestling Coach aka Papaji\nBrahm Bhardwaj as Mauni Baba\n\nProduction\nMukherjee was loosely inspired by Ikiru, and initially considered Shashi Kapoor and his brother Raj Kapoor for the lead role in the early 1960s. The character of Anand was inspired by Raj Kapoor, who used to call Mukherjee \"Babu Moshay\". It is believed that Mukherjee wrote the film when once Kapoor was seriously ill and Mukherjee thought that he may die. The film was dedicated to Kapoor and the people of Mumbai.\nLater, Mukherjee thought of making the film in Bengali language, with Uttam Kumar as Babu Moshai. When this plan also failed, he considered Kishore Kumar and Mehmood (as Babu Moshai) in lead roles. One of the producers, N. C. Sippy, had earlier served as Mehmood's production manager. Mukherjee was asked to meet Kishore Kumar to discuss the project. However, when he went to Kishore Kumar's residence, he was driven away by the gatekeeper due to a misunderstanding. Kishore Kumar (himself a Bengali) was involved in a financial dispute with a Bengali event manager over a stage show. He had instructed his gatekeeper to drive away this \"Bengali\", if he ever visited the house. The gatekeeper mistook Hrishikesh Mukherjee to be this \"Bengali\", and refused him entry. The incident hurt Mukherjee and he decided not to work with Kumar. Consequently, Mehmood had to leave the film as well. According to Dharmendra, he was also considered for the lead role before it went to Rajesh Khanna. As a playback singer, Kishore Kumar had become the preferred voice for Khanna by this time, but Anand did not have any song by him.\nHrishikesh Mukherjee shot the film in 28 days. The screenplay of Anand was written by Gulzar (who also wrote the dialogue and the lyrics of a few songs), Bimal Dutt, D.N. Mukherjee and Hrishikesh Mukherjee.\nLater, Anand was remade in Malayalam, with the name Chitrashalabham.\n\nMusic\nThe musical score and songs were composed by Salil Chowdhary.  One of the songs, \"Kahin Door Jaab Din Dhal Jaye\" was originally composed as a Bengali song 20 years prior, \"Amay proshno kare\" and the original sung in Bengali by him is available on YouTube.\nThe lyrics were written by Gulzar and Yogesh. Gulzar wrote the poem \"Maut Tu Ek Kavita Hai\", which is narrated by Amitabh Bachchan.\nBefore confirming Chowdhary for songs, Mukherjee approached Lata Mangeshkar to get the songs composed, as she had already worked as a music director in Marathi films under the pseudonym of \"Anandghan\". She, however, politely refused the offer and decided to sing the songs in the film rather than composing them.\n\nAwards\nHome media\nNumerous DVD editions entered the market by companies like \"Digital Entertainment Inc.\", Shemaroo Entertainment and \"Eagle Home Video\". These were released as non-restored, non-re-mastered editions and bare-bones, devoid of supplementary features.\nEagle Home Video came out with a restored edition on Blu-ray, preserving the original aspect ratio in 4:3 pillar box and a DTS Master Audio (HD) in 2.0. The restoration took place in Shemaroo Studios.\n\nImpact\nTill the time of the release of Anand, the star of the film, Amitabh Bachchan, was not recognized in public. Sharing the incident on Twitter, a fan-Aashish Palod reminded him of how he got recognition from the film. On the release day of the film, Bachchan went to a petrol pump to fill up the tank of his car and no one recognized him. But, after the release of the film in the evening, when he went to the same petrol pump for a refill, the public started identifying him. Bachchan posted on Twitter, \"this is a true happening .. it was the petrol pump at Irla, on SV Road.\"\n\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\nZaveri, Hanif (2005). \"A Comedy King and Superstar\".

Founded in 1951 and originally run in June, the festival has been held every February since 1978 and is one of Europe's \"Big Three\" film festivals alongside the Venice Film Festival held in Italy and the Cannes Film Festival held in France. Furthermore, it is one of the \"Big Five\", the most prestigious film festivals in the world. The festival regularly draws tens of thousands of visitors each year.\nAbout 400 films are shown at multiple venues across Berlin, mostly in and around Potsdamer Platz. They are screened in nine sections across cinematic genres, with around twenty films competing for the festival's top awards in the Competition section. The major awards, called the Golden Bear and Silver Bears, are decided on by the international jury, chaired by an internationally recognisable cinema personality. This jury and other specialised Berlinale juries also give many other awards, and in addition there are other awards given by independent juries and organisations.\nThe European Film Market (EFM), a film trade fair held simultaneously to the Berlinale, is a major industry meeting for the international film circuit. The trade fair serves distributors, film buyers, producers, financiers and co-production agents. The Berlinale Talents, a week-long series of lectures and workshops, is a gathering of young filmmakers held in partnership with the festival.\n\nHistory\nFirst festival\nDuring the peak of the Cold War in 1950, Oscar Martay, a film officer of the Information Service Branch of the American High Commissioner for Germany stationed in Berlin, proposed the idea of a film festival in Berlin. The proposal was put through a committee, which included members of the Senate of Berlin and people from the German film industry, on 9 October 1950. Through his efforts and influence, the American military administration was persuaded to assist and to give loans for the first years of the Berlin International Film Festival, which commenced in June 1951. Film historian Dr. Alfred Bauer was the festival's first director, a position he would hold until 1976.\nAlfred Hitchcock's Rebecca opened the first festival at the Titania-Palast in Steglitz on 6 June 1951. The festival ran from 6 to 17 June, with Waldb\u00fchne being another festival venue.\nThe winners of the inaugural awards in 1951 were determined by a West German panel, and there were five winners of the Golden Bear, divided by categories and genres. Cinderella, which won the Golden Bear for a Music Film, also won the audience award.\n\nEarly years and awards\nThe FIAPF (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des Associations de Producteurs de Films) banned the awarding of jury prizes at the festival, so between 1952 and 1955, the winners of the Golden Bear were determined by the audience members. In 1956, FIAPF formally accredited the festival and since then the Golden Bear has been awarded by an international jury.\nPrior to the erection of the Berlin Wall in 1961, a selection of the films were also screened in East Berlin.\nThe fifth edition in 1955 saw the first German film to win the Golden Bear, Robert Siodmak's Die Ratten.\nIn 1957, the Zoo Palast became the main venue for the festival, and remained so until the move to Potsdamer Platz in 2000 (see Venues below).\n\n1960s\nIn 1963, two years after the Berlin Wall had been erected, a daily show of the Berlinale was shown on television in East Germany, with five films in competition broadcast.\nControversy arose in 1964 with the rejection by Bauer, on insistence from the church, of Vilgot Sj\u00f6man's second film, 491, from the competition.\nWerner Herzog's first feature film, Lebenszeichen, premiered at the festival in 1968.\n\n1970s\nThe 20th edition of the festival in 1970 was cut short and awards not issued following controversy over the showing of Michael Verhoeven's anti-war film o.k.. The jury, headed by American film director George Stevens, decided after a 7\u20132 vote to remove the film from the competition, justifying their decision by citing a FIAPF guideline that said: \"All film festivals should contribute to better understanding between nations\". Stevens claimed that the film, which includes a gang rape of a Vietnamese woman by American soldiers during the Vietnam War, was anti-American. One jury member, Du\u0161an Makavejev, protested against this measure, stood up for the film and supported Verhoeven and producer Rob Houwer. Verhoeven defended his film by stating in these terms: \"I have not made an anti-American film... The biggest part of the American people today is against the war in Vietnam\". Other directors taking part in the festival withdrew their films in protest, and the jury was accused of censorship and eventually disbanded, so no prizes were awarded and the competition was suspended.\nThis scandal had such a big effect that it was unclear if the festival would continue to take place the next year. The following year, the festival was re-formed and a new International Forum for New Cinema was created.\n1975 saw the first East German film to be entered into the festival, Jacob the Liar.\nAt the premiere of In the Realm of the Senses in 1976, the film was confiscated in the projection room by Berlin police and the \"Forum\" management criminally accused of the public screening a pornographic film.\nBauer was succeeded by film journalist Wolf Donner in 1976, who gave German films higher priority. After his first Berlinale in June 1977, Donner successfully negotiated the shift of the festival from the June to February (22 February \u2013 5 March 1978), a change which has remained ever since.\nThat festival, the 28th edition, saw the jury award the Golden Bear to Spain for its contribution to the festival rather than a specific film. The three Spanish films which were screened at the festival and won it were short film Ascensor directed by Tom\u00e1s Mu\u00f1oz and feature films La palabras de Max by Emilio Mart\u00ednez L\u00e1zaro and Las truchas by Jos\u00e9 Luis Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez. The 1978 festival also saw the start of the European Film Market as well as a new section, \"Cinema for People Six and up\" (which later became \"Kinderfilmfest\").\n\nJust before the 1979 festival, Donner announced that he was resigning. The festival also saw further controversy that year when the Soviet Union and other socialist states withdrew their films and delegates in protest at the selection of The Deer Hunter and their solidarity with \"the heroic people of Vietnam\".\n\n1980\u20132000\nDonner was followed by Moritz de Hadeln, who held the position from 1980 until director Dieter Kosslick took over in 2001.\nIn 1981, de Hadeln only nominated one German film for the competition, Der Neger Erwin, and other German producers and directors called for his resignation and proposed a boycott although no boycott took place.\nIn 1986, Gina Lollobrigida was invited to head the jury at the 36th Berlin International Film Festival, which awarded the Golden Bear to Reinhard Hauff's film Stammheim. She said the majority decision was \"prefabricated\", and opposed it.\n\n21st century\nKosslick started making some changes to the festival, moving the emphasis from Hollywood in order to focus more on German and international cinema. He introduced various events to assist the development of emerging talent in German cinema.\n\nIn 2010, for the 60th edition of the festival, Werner Herzog was appointed president of the jury. Also in that year, the city of Berlin unveiled its Boulevard of the Stars, with the first of 40 stars devoted to actors and filmmakers of the German-speaking film and TV industry. First to be honoured in the Boulevard was German-American actress Marlene Dietrich.\nIn 2012 the 100th anniversary of the historic Studio Babelsberg was celebrated at the 62nd edition of the festival, with the screening of 10 classic films made at the studios.\nA new Series section, devoted to longform television series, was introduced in 2015.\nIn June 2018, it was announced that Mariette Rissenbeek would serve as the new executive director alongside artistic director Carlo Chatrian. They assumed their posts after Kosslick's final edition in 2019. Rissenbeek became the first woman to lead the Berlinale.\nA shortened 71st festival took place virtually in March 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n73rd Berlin International Film Festival held in February 2023, was the first completely in-person Berlinale since the 70th in 2020.\n\nDescription and governance\nThe Berlinale is considered one of the five major film festivals in the world, alongside Venice, Cannes, Sundance and Toronto, and is the largest based on attendance. As of 2020, around 325,000 tickets were sold, and nearly 16,000 film industry professionals from 130 countries attended the festival. It is held in Berlin. It attracts tens of thousands of visitors each year. For the 2022 event, still feeling the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, 156,472 tickets were sold.\nAbout 400 films are shown in several sections across cinematic genres, with around twenty films competing for the festival's top awards, the Golden Bear and Silver Bears.\nIn 2022, festival was receiving \u20ac10.3 million from the Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media. There was consideration given by the federal government to help compensate for revenue lost and additional expenditure owing to the pandemic, with funds drawn from the Neustart Kultur programme.\nSince 2019, Mariette Rissenbeek has been the festival's executive director; Carlo Chatrian is its artistic director. In September 2023, it was reported that artistic director Carlo Chatrian will relinquish his post after 2024 Berlinale. On 12 December 2023 it was announced by the German culture ministry that Tricia Tuttle, formerly director of the BFI London Film Festival, will be the sole director of the Berlinale from April 2024.\n\nEntries\nThe festival is open to films of every length and genre, but there is priority given to international and European premieres, and the films need to have been completed within the year preceding the festival. Submissions open in September of the preceding year.\n\nFestival programme\nAs of 2024 the festival is composed of eight different sections:\n\nCompetition:  feature-length films yet to be released outside their country of origin, which compete for several prizes, including the top Golden Bear for the best film and a series of Silver Bears for acting, writing and production\nBerlinale Special (a diverse selection of films, events and people) & Berlinale Series (for television series)\nEncounters, to foster \"daring works\" (established 2020)\nBerlinale Shorts, for short films since 2007 a separate section; short films were honoured with Golden and Silver Bears from 1955, with a separate jury for shorts established in 2003\nPanorama: originally known as \"Information show\" screening innovative, mostly independent, films. In 1986 it was renamed \"Panorama\" showing films that \"break with convention and tackle contemporary themes in a novel way, discover new talents or new cinematographic style.\" It is currently described as \"explicitly queer, explicitly feminist, explicitly political\"\nForum & Forum Expanded: reflections on the medium of film; a selection of around 40 films, independently curated and organised by Arsenal Institute for Film and Video Art as part of the Berlinale, since 1971 Barbara Wurm, the author and curator, was appointed new head of Berlinale Forum on 7 March 2023 succeeding Cristina Nord. She is to take charge from 1 August 2023.\nGeneration: comprising Generation Kplus and Generation 14plus, two competition programmes screening international cinema exploring the worlds of children and teenagers; started in 1978 with a selection \"Cinema for People Six and up\"; then Kinderfilmfest (\"Children\u2019s Film Festival\"); expanded to include the 14plus competition in 2004; renamed Generation in 2007, with the two sections\nRetrospective, Berlinale Classics & Homage, established in 1977, curated by the Deutsche Kinemathek \u2013 Museum f\u00fcr Film und Fernsehen, and awarder of the Honorary Golden Bear for a lifetime's achievement in filmmaking\n\"Perspektive Deutsches Kino\" (Perspectives on German Cinema) was created in 2002 by incoming director Dieter Kosslick with Alfred Holighaus. This was dropped from 2024 Berlinale due to budget cuts.\nA section called \"Culinary Cinema\" had also been introduced by Kosslick in 2007, as well as a series called \"NATIVe\" (for indigenous filmmakers) in 2013; however, these were dropped after his departure in 2019.\n\nAwards\nThe Golden Bear (Goldener B\u00e4r) is the highest prize awarded for the best film at the Berlin International Film Festival. In its first year in 1951, it was awarded to the best film in each of five categories, by an all-German jury.\nFrom 1952 to 1955 the Golden and Silver Bears were awarded by audience voting, as the FIAPF had determined after the first festival that only Cannes and Venice Film Festivals were allowed to appoint official juries. A Silver Bear (Silberner B\u00e4r) and a Bronze Berlin Bear, determined by audience vote, were also awarded from 1952 to 1955. After the FIAPF ruled to allow it, an official international jury determined the prizes from 1956 onwards, and in the same year a second Golden Bear was added, for best short film, as well as a second category of award, the Silver Bear, for individual achievements in acting or directing. In 1965, a runner-up prize to the Golden Bear was added.\nThe statuettes awarded as trophies are based on the B\u00e4r first created by sculptor Ren\u00e9e Sintenis (1888\u20131965) in 1932. The bear, based on the coat of arms of Berlin and depicting a bear standing on its hind legs with its arms raised, became popular in the 1930s, bringing wealth to Sintenis. Since the 3rd edition of the festival in 1953, replicas of the bear have been produced by the Noack Foundry.\n\nInternational jury prizes\nThe main prizes in the festival are those awarded by the international jury since 1956, which today include the Golden Bear and various Silver Bears. In 1956, apart from the Golden Bear, there were also Silver Bears awarded by the new international feature film jury for best director, best actress, best actor, best outstanding single achievement, outstanding artistic contribution, and a Silver Bear International Prize.\nAs of 2022 the Golden Bear for Best Film is awarded to the producers of the best feature film.\nAs of 2022 the categories of Silver Bear awards are:\n\nSilver Bear Grand Jury Prize\nSilver Bear Jury Prize\nSilver Bear for Best Short Film\nSilver Bear for Best Director\nSilver Bear for Best Leading Performance\nSilver Bear for Best Supporting Performance\nSilver Bear for Best Screenplay\nSilver Bear for Outstanding Artistic Contribution\n\nOther Berlinale awards\nThe Honorary Golden Bear has been awarded for lifetime achievement since 1982, when it was awarded to James Stewart. It is presented to someone with an exceptional artistic career, and is given to the guest of honour of the Homage section which has been run since 1977 by the Berlinale and the Deutsche Kinemathek \u2013 Museum f\u00fcr Film und Fernsehen.\nAwards for short films are awarded by a separate international short film jury consisting of three filmmakers and artists.

The Titiana Palast building, dating from 1926, still bears this name on a sign outside, but as of 2022 is known as the Cineplex Titania. It was renovated in 2014, creating seven cinemas with over 1,200 seats, along with 7.1 Dolby Digital sound technology.\nThe historic Delphi Filmpalast am Zoo (aka the Delphi; built on the site of an old dance hall, was opened in 1949 by Walter Jonigkeit. It is located near the Berlin Zoologischer Garten and has been used for the festival almost since its inception. Since 1981 it has been one of the main venues for the Forum programme, maintaining its old style as a picture palace. In 2015 the stalls seating was replaced, reducing the number of seats by 114 and improving spacing and comfort. Seating an audience of up to 673 people, it is one of Germany's biggest independent screens. In February 2022, ready for the 72nd edition of the festival, a state-of-the-art Christie CP4440-RGB laser cinema projector was installed.\nThe Zoo Palast was built in 1957 to designs by cinema architect Gerhard Fritsche, and opened with the film Die Z\u00fcrcher Verlobung, starring Liselotte Pulver, who also cut the ribbon in the opening ceremony. It was purpose-built for the festival. It remained the home of the festival Until 1999, and was the venue for films premiering in competition. It closed from 2011 until late 2013 for a complete interior reconstruction and renovation, opening in time for the 2014 festival with seven cinemas and offering a total of 1,650 seats, and space for 791 in the main auditorium. The renovations were designed by architect Anna Maske. Liselotte Pulver again reopened the cinema after renovations in 1994 and 2013.\nThe exhibition space and screening hall of the Academy of Arts (Akademie der K\u00fcnste) in the Tiergarten district was used as a venue before the Berlinale moved its main activities to Potsdamer Platz in 2000. It was briefly a venue for the Forum program from 2015, and once again took on duties as screening venue after the closure of the Sony Center at the end of 2019.\nThe eight-screen CineStar Sony Center, and later the adjoining CineStar IMAX, both located in the Sony Center at Potsdamer Platz, were venues until the closure of the Sony Center at the end of 2019.\nIn 2007, the CineStar CUBIX multiplex cinema (Cubix am Alexanderplatz, styled CUBIX), which opened in November 2000, started screening films for the festival on three of its screens. From 2020, after the closure of the Sony Center, the festival expanded its use of CineStar CUBIX to use all nine screens.\nThe Kino Babylon was a Berlinale venue from 2008 (when it hosted its new \"Generation14plus\" event) to 2010, but has not been listed as such since 2011.\nSince 2009, Friedrichstadt-Palast has also been used. This venue not only has the largest theatre stage in the world, but the biggest cinema of the film festival, with 1,635 seats available for screenings. Films from the Competition and Berlinale Special Gala sections are shown at Friedrichstadt-Palast, and a digital 4K laser projector is supplied for the festival.\nThe historic Kino International, built in the 1960s to the designs of GDR architect Josef Kaiser, is an example of GDR Modernism. It has been one of the venues for the Berlinale since sometime in the mid-2010s, accommodating an audience of 555 people (originally built for 600).\nThe Kino Arsenal at the Arsenal Institute for Film and Video Art (formerly known as Friends of the German Film Archive until 2008) in Potsdamer Strasse is the main venue of the Forum event. The original Arsenal, in Welserstra\u00dfe in Berlin-Sch\u00f6neberg, was where this section was born. In 1999, Arsenal moved with Friends of German Film Archive, German Film Museum and the German Film and Television Academy Berlin into the Filmhaus on Potsdamer Platz. There are two screens here, with seating for 235 and 75.\nThe Haus der Kulturen der Welt, in the middle of Tiergarten Park, is the venue for the premieres of Generation, the youth section of the festival.\nUrania Berlin is used for film premieres in the Generation section.\nThe Zeiss Major Planetarium is a planetarium, which has two spaces available for film screenings, the planetarium hall with 307 seats, and a cinema hall with 160 seats. It was one of the last buildings built in the GDR, constructed in 1987.\nOther venues in use as of 2022 include the Akademie der K\u00fcnste; the Marshall McLuhan Salon at the Canada House; Brotfabrik;  City Kino Wedding at the Centre Francais; Deutsche Kinemathek; Eva Lichtspiele; Filmtheater am Friedrichshain; Hebbel am Ufer (HAU); Kino Intimes; Neue Kammerspiele; Passage Kino; SAVVY Contemporary; Silent Green Kulturquartier; Kino Union; and the Zeughauskino (in the Deutsches Historisches Museum).\n\nRelated events\nEuropean Film Market\nThe European Film Market (EFM) is a large trade fair for marketing films, which grew from an event started in 1978.\nFilmmesse was an event led by Aina Bellis from 1980 to 1987, being succeeded by Beki Probst in 1988. From 2014 to October 2020, Matthijs Wouter Knol took over the position. In November 2020, Dennis Ruh became the director of the EFM.\nIt has grown into one of three largest movie markets in the world, and is the first film market of the year; the March\u00e9 du Film in Cannes follows in May, and the American Film Market in November.\nEFM provides exhibition space for companies presenting their current line-up, organising screenings of new films in venues around Potsdamer Platz. In 2007, the CinemaxX and CineStar were used to showcase new productions. In 2010, the Astor Film Lounge showed market screenings in three dimensions using digital RealD technology.\nIt is a professional trade event, open to registered industry insiders, hosting up to 10,000 representatives of the international film and media industries (mostly producers, sales agents, distributors and financiers). In 2020, 971 screenings of 732 registered movies took place, with 525 films celebrating their premiere. Taking place over eight days, the event is spread across several locations, including the Gropius Bau, Marriott Hotel, modern Berliner Freiheit or the historic Zoo Palast.\n\nBerlinale Talents\nCommencing in 2003, the Berlinale has partnered with the Berlinale Talents (previously Berlinale Talent Campus), which is a winter school for \"up-and-coming filmmakers\" that takes place at the same time as the festival. The Talent Campus accepts about 250 applicants each year; the attendees come from around the world, and represent all of the filmmaking professions.\nThe event runs six days during the Berlinale and features lectures and panel discussions with well-known professionals addressing issues in filmmaking. Workshops, excursions, personal tutoring, coaching, and training of participants from different fields of work are part of the programme.\nThe proceedings include presentations by experts, who have included Park Chan-wook, Frances McDormand, Stephen Frears, Dennis Hopper, Jia Zhangke, Walter Murch, Shah Rukh Khan, Joshua Oppenheimer, Anthony Minghella, Charlotte Rampling, Walter Salles, Ridley Scott, Raoul Peck, Tom Tykwer, Mike Leigh, Tilda Swinton, and Wim Wenders. Many of these presentations and lectures are archived, both as video recordings and as transcripts, on the Talents website.\n\nBerlinale Co-Production Market\nThe Berlinale Co-Production Market is a five-day networking platform for producers and financiers, as well as broadcasting and funding representatives who are participating in international co-productions. It was introduced by Dieter Kosslick in the 2000s.\n\nJury presidents\nSince 1956, the jury of the Festival has been chaired by an internationally recognised personality of cinema, except in 2021, when the directors of six previous Golden-Bear-winning films determined the awards for the Competition of the 71st Berlinale.\n\nWorld Cinema Fund\nThe World Cinema Fund (WCF) is associated with the Berlinale, and was established to provide financial support to feature film projects in countries with a weak film industry infrastructure. It was established by Dieter Kosslick in 2004 to support films \"that stand out with an unconventional aesthetic approach, that tell powerful stories and transmit an authentic image of their cultural roots\". It awards several projects in various stages of production with funding each year.\nThe WCF is a collaboration with the Federal Foundation for Culture, and awarded in cooperation with the Goethe Institute, the Foreign Ministry and German producers. It aims \"to develop and support cinema in regions with a weak film infrastructure, while fostering cultural diversity in German cinemas\", and supports films that could not be made without extra funding.

The story centers on the aftermath of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and its effect on a surviving family.\n\nPlot\nHalf-orphan Yasuko, who lives with her uncle Shigematsu and his wife Shigeko in Hiroshima, is in the middle of moving family belongings to the house of an acquaintance in the vicinity, when the atomic bomb is dropped. She returns to the city by boat and gets into a black rain, a fallout resulting from the bombing. After Yasuko is re-united with her uncle and aunt, the trio heads for the factory where her uncle works to escape the spreading fires. Their route is marked by ruins, scattered corpses, and severely burnt survivors.\n5 years later, Yasuko lives with her uncle, aunt and her uncle's mother in Fukuyama. As she has long reached the age when a woman should get married by tradition, Shigematsu and Shigeko try to find a husband for her. Yet all prospects' families withdraw their proposal when they hear of Yasuko's presence in Hiroshima on the day of the bombing, fearing that she might become ill or be unable to give birth to healthy children. Yasuko eventually accepts her situation and decides to stay with her uncle's family, even when her father, who remarried, offers her to live in his house.\nShigematsu witnesses his friends, all hibakusha suffering from radiation sickness, die one after another, while also his, his wife's and niece's health is slowly deteriorating. Yasuko starts feeling close to Yuichi, a young man from the neighbourhood who is suffering from a war trauma. When Yuichi's mother asks for Shigematsu's approval of her son marrying Yasuko, he is indignant at first because of Yuichi's mental illness, but later agrees. Shortly after, Yasuko, already suffering from a tumor, starts losing her hair and is sent to the hospital. Shigematsu watches the departing ambulance, hoping for a rainbow to appear which would indicate that she will recover.\nThroughout the film, the story of the consequences of the bombing of Hiroshima are portrayed in graphic detail, with journals and firsthand accounts of the victims of the Hiroshima atomic bombing in order to shed light on how terrible nuclear weapons can be for innocent civilians.  One of these victims recollected that he \u201cwas three years old at the time of the bombing.  {He couldn\u2019t} remember much, but {he did} recall that {his} surroundings turned blindingly white\u2026Then, pitch darkness.  {He} was buried alive under the house.  {His} face was misshapen. {He} was certain that {he} was dead.\u201d  This is reflected in a scene where bodies were engulfed by a blinding light followed by the insurmountable suffering of the masses.  There is another story of a woman's father who was in the blast and suffered from many of the same long-term effects of the bomb. In both the account and in the movie, hair falls out of the victims\u2019 heads and they slowly die of radiation poisoning from the bomb.\nSome of the accounts described the horrors of the surroundings and the conditions of the bodies after the bombing.  Yoshiro Yamawaki and his brothers were going to check on their father who was working in a factory.  The air quality is described in both the witness\u2019 story and the movie as being horrible, smelling of rotten flesh.

Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave it 3\u00bd of 4 stars, praising its \"beautifully textured\" black-and-white photography and pointing out that its purpose was not an anti-nuclear message movie but \"a film about how the survivors of that terrible day internalized their experiences\". Geoff Andrew, writing for Time Out, stated that \"despite the largely sensitive depiction of waste, suffering and despair, the often ponderous pacing and the script's solemnity tend to work against emotional involvement\". Film scholar Alexander Jacoby discovered an \"almost Ozu-like quietism\", citing Black Rain as an example of the \"mellowed\" Imamura in his later years. Film historian Donald Richie pointed out the film's \"warmth, sincerity and compassion\".\n\nAwards\nJapanese Academy Awards 1990: Best Actress, Best Cinematography, Best Director, Best Editing, Best Film, Best Lighting, Best Music Score, Best Screenplay, Best Supporting Actress (Etsuko Ichihara)\nBlue Ribbon Award 1990: Best Actress\nCannes Film Festival 1989: Prize of the Ecumenical Jury \u2013 Special Mention, Technical Grand Prize\nFilm Fest Gent 1989: Grand Prix, Best Film\nFilm Fest Gent 1989: Georges Delerue Prize, Golden Spur\nHochi Film Awards 1989: Best Actress\nKinema Junpo Award 1990: Best Actress, Best Director, Best Film\nMainichi Film Concours 1990: Best Actress, Best Art Direction, Best Film\nSant Jordi Awards 1991: Best Foreign Film\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nIma-Izumi, Yoko (2007). \"Nuclear Bomb Films in Japan and America: Two Black Rain Films\".

He is also known for his roles in The Girl in the Caf\u00e9 (2006) and the BBC's Worricker trilogy which include Page Eight (2012), Turks & Caicos (2014), and Salting the Battlefield (2014), and the BBC's Ordeal by Innocence (2018).\n\nEarly life and education\nWilliam Francis Nighy was born on 12 December 1949 in Caterham, Surrey, the son of Alfred Martin Nighy (1913\u20131976) and Catherine Josephine, (n\u00e9e Whittaker) (1915\u20132003). His father managed a car garage after working in the family chimney sweeping business; his mother was a psychiatric nurse of Irish descent born in Glasgow, Scotland.\nNighy was brought up as a Roman Catholic and served as an altar boy; however, he gave up \"being a practising Catholic\" as a teenager. He has two elder siblings, Martin and Anna. He attended the John Fisher School, a Roman Catholic grammar school in Purley, where he was nicknamed \"Knucks\" because of his hands, and was a member of the theatre group.\nAs a child he was known by many to be insecure and shy; as a teenager he became an avid reader, particularly enjoying the works of Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald. He left school at the age of 15, without qualifications, and later with a friend travelled to Paris hoping and failing \"to write a novel\".\nHe worked variously in a local employment office and as a messenger for The Croydon Advertiser and The Field. He then applied for a place at RADA, but was rejected and instead enrolled at the Guildford School of Dance and Drama to train for the stage.\n\nCareer\n1969\u20131984: Early roles\nAfter working in various regional theatre productions during his early twenties in theatres such as the Cambridge Arts Theatre and Edinburgh's Traverse Theatre, a friend of Nighy's suggested that he audition for the Everyman Theatre in Liverpool. During his audition he asked to start again about five times, according to fellow actor Jonathan Pryce, who said that \"either he was a very good actor, or a madman\". During his time at the Everyman he worked alongside fellow actors Julie Walters and Pete Postlethwaite, and writers Ken Campbell and Willy Russell. He was also a member of the travelling theatre group Van Load, which included one of Nighy's most frequent collaborators, writer and director David Hare.\nNighy made his London stage debut at the National Theatre in an epic staging of Ken Campbell and Chris Langham's Illuminatus!, after he met Campbell at a bar in London. When Nighy told him that he was an actor, Campbell hired him on the spot. It opened the new Cottesloe Theatre on 4 March 1977. He was cast in two David Hare premieres, A Map of The World and Pravda, also at the National. Nighy starred in three episodes of the British anthology series Play For Today from 1978 to 1982. He played Samwise Gamgee in the 1981 BBC Radio dramatisation of The Lord of the Rings (credited as William Nighy), and was heard in the 1980s BBC Radio version of Yes Minister.\n\n1985\u20131999: National Theatre and acclaim\nAfter Nighy made his debut, he steadily gained acclaim with his performances in David Hare's Pravda in 1985, William Shakespeare's King Lear in 1986 and Anton Chekov's The Seagull in 1994. At the National Theatre, he acted in productions alongside Anthony Hopkins, Judi Dench, Harriet Walter, Rufus Sewell and Chiwetel Ejiofor. Nighy's most acclaimed stage performances were in National Theatre productions. As Bernard Nightingale, an unscrupulous university don, in Tom Stoppard's Arcadia (1993), he engaged in witty exchanges with Felicity Kendal, who played Hannah Jarvis, an author.\nNighy played Jerry in Harold Pinter's Betrayal in 1991 at the Almeida Theatre. He played a consultant psychiatrist in Joe Penhall's Blue\/Orange (2000), for which he received an Olivier Award nomination for Best Actor. It transferred to the West End at the Duchess Theatre the following year. In 1997, he starred as restaurant entrepreneur Tom Sergeant in David Hare's Skylight, which had premiered in 1995 and was moved to the Vaudeville Theatre. He played a libidinous young disc jockey, Vincent Fish, in the 1980 comedy series Agony, where he was the occasional lover of the lead character, played by Maureen Lipman. He also starred in two episodes of the BBC series Performance in 1991 and 1993.\nOne of Nighy's early major screen appearances was the BBC serial The Men's Room (1991). He claimed that the serial, an Ann Oakley novel adapted by Laura Lamson, was the job that launched his career. He received some recognition by American audiences for his acclaimed character portrayal of fifty-year-old rock star Ray Simms in the 1998 film Still Crazy. In 1999 he gained further prominence in the UK with the starring role in \"The Photographer\", an episode of the award-winning BBC-TV mockumentary comedy series People Like Us, playing Will Rushmore, a middle aged man who has abandoned his career and family in the deluded belief that he can achieve success as a commercial photographer. Since 1999, Nighy has played Simon Brett's fictional amateur sleuth Charles Paris at least 17 times on BBC Radio 4.\n\n2000\u20132009: Career expansion\nIn 2003, Nighy played the role of the Vampire Elder Viktor in the American production Underworld. (He returned to that role in the sequel Underworld: Evolution in 2006, and again in the prequel Underworld: Rise of the Lycans in 2009.) In the same year he portrayed Billy Mack, an irreverent rock'n'roll legend, in the British ensemble romantic comedy film Love Actually, for which he was awarded the BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor. At the BAFTA Television Awards in April 2004, he won the Best Actor award for State of Play. He also appeared in the comedy Shaun of the Dead. In early 2004, The Sunday Times reported that Nighy was on the shortlist for the role of the Ninth Doctor in the 2005 revival of the BBC television series Doctor Who. Christopher Eccleston ultimately filled the role. In 2005, he appeared as Slartibartfast in the film adaptation of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\nIn 2005, he acted in the Fernando Meirelles-directed drama The Constant Gardener alongside Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz. He also starred in the one-off BBC One comedy-drama The Girl in the Caf\u00e9 alongside Kelly MacDonald for which he received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Miniseries or Television Film. In February 2006, he appeared in scriptwriter Stephen Poliakoff's one-off drama Gideon's Daughter. Nighy played the lead character, Gideon, a successful events organiser who begins to lose touch with the world around him. This performance won him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Mini-series or TV Film in January 2007. Also in 2006, Nighy made his Broadway debut alongside Julianne Moore in the David Hare play The Vertical Hour, directed by Sam Mendes at the Music Box Theatre. David Rooney of Variety gave the production a mixed review, writing that \"Stuffed with stimulating insights, it's never dull but ultimately feels as messy and unresolved as the conflict behind its central debate. Sam Mendes' production does have one reason for unstinting recommendation, however, in Bill Nighy's fascinatingly eccentric performance.\"\nIn 2006, Nighy played the principal villain, Davy Jones, in Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest with his face entirely obscured by computer-generated makeup. He voiced the character with a Scots accent. He reprised the role in the 2007 sequel, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, in which his real face was briefly revealed in one scene. He also provided the narration for the Animal Planet series Meerkat Manor. In 2006 he played the role of Richard Hart in the Richard Eyre-directed drama Notes on a Scandal, alongside Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett. For the role he was nominated for a London Film Critics' Circle award. Nighy also appeared as General Friedrich Olbricht, one of the principal conspirators, in the 2008 film Valkyrie. He had played an SS officer in the 1985 Hitler's SS: Portrait in Evil. He starred in the film Wild Target in 2010. In July 2009, he announced that he would play Rufus Scrimgeour in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1. Nighy had already worked with director David Yates twice, and with the majority of the Harry Potter cast in previous films. He has said of his role as Rufus Scrimgeour that it meant he was no longer the only English actor not to be in Harry Potter.\n\n2010\u20132019: Established actor\nIn 2010, he made a small cameo in Doctor Who, in the episode titled \"Vincent and the Doctor\". Nighy voiced Grandsanta in the 2011 animated film Arthur Christmas. In 2012, he starred in the British romantic comedy The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel acting opposite Judi Dench, Dev Patel, Tom Wilkinson, and Maggie Smith. Nighy along with the ensemble received a nomination for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. That same year he acted in the action films Wrath of the Titans starring Sam Worthington and Ralph Fiennes and the remake of Total Recall starring Colin Farrell. In 2013, he played a role in Darkside, Tom Stoppard's radio drama based on Pink Floyd's album The Dark Side of the Moon. In 2014 he acted in the historical comedy-drama film Pride and the science-fiction fantasy film I, Frankenstein.\nDuring this time Nighy played MI5 agent Johnny Worricker in a trilogy of films written and directed by David Hare; Page Eight (2011), Turks & Caicos (2014), and Salting the Battlefield (2014). Nighy acted in these films alongside Rachel Weisz, Ralph Fiennes, Helena Bonham Carter, and Michael Gambon. For his performance in Page Eight he received nominations for the British Academy Television Award for Best Single Drama and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Miniseries or Television Film. In 2014, he starred with Carey Mulligan in a revival of David Hare's Skylight at Wyndham's Theatre in London's West End. It had a large international audience via broadcast in the National Theatre Live series. Nighy returned to Broadway starring in the transfer in Skylight alongside Mulligan where they both received nominations for the Tony Awards for Best Actor in a Play and Best Actress in a Play respectively. That same year he starred in the sequel to The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, titled The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (2015).\n\nThe following year he acted in the war film Their Finest (2016) where it premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival to positive reviews. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian praised Nighy, describing him as \"a colossally proportioned scene-stealer\". In that year he was in several films, including the British war comedy Dad's Army, the animated feature Norm of the North and the horror-mystery The Limehouse Golem. In 2017, acting alongside Emily Mortimer, he starred in the drama The Bookshop, based on the 1978 novel of the same title by Penelope Fitzgerald. That same year he was in the short film Red Nose Day Actually, reprising his role of Billy Mack from Love Actually (2003).

In October 2020, it was announced that Nighy would play the leading role in Living, an English-language adaptation of Akira Kurosawa\u2019s 1952 Japanese drama Ikiru, to be directed by Oliver Hermanus from a screenplay by Kazuo Ishiguro.

For his performance he went on to receive nominations for the Academy Award, BAFTA Award, Golden Globe Award, and Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actor.\nIn the 2022 TV series The Man Who Fell to Earth Nighy played the brilliant Thomas Newton, the first alien resident of Earth, who arrived over 40 years ago. This role originally was played by David Bowie in the 1976 film adaptation. Nighy is also the narrator of the Channel 5 travel show The World's Most Scenic Railway Journeys, a programme that began its fifth series in autumn 2021 with episodes featuring train journeys across Australia and the Welsh borders. In 2022, Nighy became a DJ on BBC 6 Music when he stood in for Guy Garvey on the regular Sunday afternoon programme Guy Garvey's Finest Hour, with Nighy deputising for the Elbow frontman again at the beginning of 2023. He later deputised for Iggy Pop on his show Iggy Confidential from March to April 2023, and again in December 2023.\n\nPersonal life\nBeginning in 1982, Nighy was in a relationship with English actress Diana Quick, after they both played in David Hare's A Map of The World.

He has also spoken of his role in Pride, a film extolling the mutual support between the National Union of Miners and gay rights groups in the UK in the 1980s, as one of his most cherished.\nIn 2004, Nighy was a guest on Desert Island Discs, presented by Sue Lawley. One of his chosen discs was \"Won't Get Fooled Again\" by the Who, so that he could practise his hobby of air guitar while marooned. As his luxury, he chose a boxed set of blues harp harmonicas and instruction book.\nNighy is noted for his bespoke navy suits.

His work helped shape the careers of many actors, directors and screenwriters, though his reviews were  criticized as unnecessarily harsh. Crowther was an advocate of foreign-language films in the 1950s and 1960s, particularly those of Roberto Rossellini, Vittorio De Sica, Ingmar Bergman, and Federico Fellini.\n\nLife and career\nCrowther was born Francis Bosley Crowther Jr. in Lutherville, Maryland, the son of Eliza Hay (n\u00e9e Leisenring, 1877\u20131960) and Francis Bosley Crowther (1874\u20131950). As a child, Crowther moved to Winston-Salem, North Carolina, where he published a neighborhood newspaper, The Evening Star. His family moved to Washington, D.C., and Crowther graduated from Western High School in 1922. After two years of prep school at Woodberry Forest School, he entered Princeton University, where he majored in history and was editor of The Daily Princetonian. During his final year in 1928, he won The New York Times's Intercollegiate Current Events Contest and won a trip to Europe. Following his return, Crowther was offered a job as a cub reporter for The New York Times at a salary of $30 per week. He declined the offer, made to him by the publisher Adolph S. Ochs, hoping to find employment on a small Southern newspaper. When the salary offered by those papers was not half of the Times offer, he went to New York and took the job. He was the first nightclub reporter for the Times, and in 1932 was asked by Brooks Atkinson to join the drama department as assistant drama editor. He spent five years covering the theater scene in New York, and even dabbled in writing for it.\nWhile at the Times in those early years, Crowther met Florence Marks, a fellow employee; the couple married on January 20, 1933. They had three sons, Bosley Crowther III, an attorney; John M. Crowther, a writer and artist; and Jefferson, a banker and the father of Welles Remy Crowther who died in the September 11 attacks in 2001.\nIn 1937 he became assistant screen editor and in 1940 replaced Frank Nugent as film critic for The New York Times as well as screen editor. He was film critic for the Times until he semi-retired in 1967 and became critic emeritus. In 1954, he received the Directors Guild of America's first film criticism award.\nAfter he semi-retired from the Times, he also started to work for Columbia Pictures helping them identify stories and films to buy. One of the stories he suggested was S. J. Wilson's To Find a Man.\nIn addition to his film criticism, Crowther wrote The Lion's Share: The Story of an Entertainment Empire (1957), the first book documenting the history of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Hollywood Rajah: The Life and Times of Louis B. Mayer (1960), a biography of the head of the MGM studio, The Great Films: 50 Golden Years of the Motion Picture Industry (1967), and Treasury of the Talking Picture.\n\nFilm criticism\nPerhaps conscious of the power of his reviews, Crowther adopted a tone that New York Times obituarist Robert D. McFadden considered to be \"scholarly rather than breezy\". Frank Beaver wrote in Bosley Crowther: Social Critic of the Film, 1940\u20131967 that Crowther opposed displays of patriotism in films and believed that a movie producer \"should balance his political attitudes even in the uncertain times of the 1940s and 1950s, during the House Un-American Activities Committee\". Crowther's review of the wartime drama Mission to Moscow (1943), made during the period when the Soviet Union was one of the Allied Powers with the United States, chided the film by saying it should show \"less ecstasy\", and wrote:\n\"It is just as ridiculous to pretend that Russia has been a paradise of purity as it is to say the same thing of ourselves\".\nIn the 1950s, Crowther was an opponent of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, whose anti-communist crusade targeted the State Department, the administration of Harry S. Truman, the U.S. Army, and individual government employees. However, he also criticised the left-wing film Knock on Any Door for blaming law-abiding society for a juvenile delinquent's descent into murder: \"Rubbish! The only shortcoming of society which this film proves is that it casually tolerates the pouring of such fraudulence onto the public mind.\"\nCrowther opposed censorship of movies, and advocated greater social responsibility in the making of them. He approved of movies with social content, such as Gone with the Wind (1939), The Grapes of Wrath (1940), Citizen Kane (1941), The Lost Weekend (1945), All the King's Men (1949), and High Noon (1952).\nCrowther barely concealed his disdain for Joan Crawford when reviewing her films, saying that her acting style in Female on the Beach (1955) was characterized by \"artificiality\" and \"pretentiousness,\" and also chided Crawford for her physical bearing. In his review of the Nicholas Ray film Johnny Guitar (1954), Crowther complained that \"no more femininity comes from (Crawford) than from rugged Mr. Heflin in Shane (1953). For the lady, as usual, is as sexless as the lions on the public library steps and as sharp and romantically forbidding as a package of unwrapped razor blades\".\nThough his preferences in popular movies were not always predictable, Crowther in general detested action and war films that depicted violence and gunplay.  He defended epics such as Ben-Hur (1959) and Cleopatra (1963), but gave the World War II film The Great Escape (also 1963) a highly unfavorable review, and panned David Lean's later works. He called Lawrence of Arabia (1962) a \"thundering camel-opera that tends to run down rather badly as it rolls on into its third hour and gets involved with sullen disillusion and political deceit.\"\nCrowther often admired foreign-language films, especially the works of Roberto Rossellini, Vittorio De Sica, Ingmar Bergman, and Federico Fellini. However he was critical of some iconic releases as well. He found Akira Kurosawa's classic Throne of Blood (1957, but not released in the U.S. until 1961), derived from Macbeth, ludicrous, particularly its ending; and called Gojira (Godzilla) (1954) \"an incredibly awful film\". Crowther dismissed Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960) as \"a blot on an otherwise honorable career\". After other reviewers praised the film, Crowther recanted his criticism and named it one of the top ten movies of the year, writing that Psycho was a \"bold psychological mystery picture.... [I]t represented expert and sophisticated command of emotional development with cinematic techniques.\" He commented that while Satyajit Ray's Pather Panchali (1955, US: 1958) took on \"a slim poetic form\" the structure and tempo of it \"would barely pass as a 'rough cut' with editors in Hollywood\". Writing about L'Avventura (1960), Crowther said that watching the film was \"like trying to follow a showing of a picture at which several reels have got lost.\"\nThe career of Bosley Crowther is discussed at length in For the Love of Movies: The Story of American Film Criticism, including his support for foreign-language cinema and his public repudiation of McCarthyism and the Blacklist. In this 2009 documentary film, contemporary critics who appreciate his work, such as A. O. Scott, appear, but also those who found his work too moralistic, such as Richard Schickel, Molly Haskell, and Andrew Sarris.\n\nBonnie and Clyde criticism\nThe end of Crowther's career was marked by his disdain for the 1967 film Bonnie and Clyde. He was critical of what he saw as the film's sensationalized violence. His review was negative:It is a cheap piece of bald-faced slapstick comedy that treats the hideous depredations of that sleazy, moronic pair as though they were as full of fun and frolic as the jazz-age cut-ups in Thoroughly Modern Millie... [S]uch ridiculous, camp-tinctured travesties of the kind of people these desperadoes were and of the way people lived in the dusty Southwest back in those barren years might be passed off as candidly commercial movie comedy, nothing more, if the film weren't reddened with blotches of violence of the most grisly sort... This blending of farce with brutal killings is as pointless as it is lacking in taste, since it makes no valid commentary upon the already travestied truth. And it leaves an astonished critic wondering just what purpose Mr. Penn and Mr. Beatty think they serve with this strangely antique, sentimental claptrap.\nOther critics besides Crowther panned the movie. John Simon, the critic of New York magazine, while praising its technical execution, declared \"Slop is slop, even served with a silver ladle.\" Its distributor pulled the film from circulation. However, the critical consensus on Bonnie and Clyde reversed, exemplified by two high-profile reassessments by Time and Newsweek. The latter's Joe Morgenstern wrote two reviews in consecutive issues, the second retracting and apologizing for the first. Time hired Stefan Kanfer as its new film critic in late 1967; his first assignment was an ostentatious rebuttal of his magazine's original negative review. A rave in The New Yorker by Pauline Kael was also influential.\nEven in the wake of this critical reversal, however, Crowther remained one of the film's most dogged critics. He eventually wrote three negative reviews and periodically blasted the movie in reviews of other films and in a letters column response to unhappy Times readers. The New York Times replaced Crowther as its primary film critic in early 1968, and some observers speculated that his persistent attacks on Bonnie and Clyde had shown him to be out of touch with current cinema and weighed heavily in his removal. Crowther worked as an executive consultant at Columbia Pictures after leaving the Times.\n\nDeath\nCrowther died of heart failure on March 7, 1981, at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, New York. He was survived by his wife Florence, who died in 1984; a sister, Nancy Crowther Kappes; three sons, F. Bosley, John, and Jefferson; and four grandchildren.\n\nReferences\nSources\nBosley Crowther: Social Critic of the Film, 1940\u20131967 by Frank Eugene Beaver, Ayer Publishing, 1974.

The ceremonies were initially held at the flagship Odeon Cinema in Leicester Square in London, before being held at the Royal Opera House from 2007 to 2016. From 2017 to 2022, the ceremony was held at the Royal Albert Hall in London before moving to the Royal Festival Hall for the 2023 ceremony. The statue awarded to recipients depicts a theatrical mask.\nThe first BAFTA Awards ceremony was held in 1949, and the ceremony was first broadcast on the BBC in 1956 with Vivien Leigh as the host. The ceremony was initially held in April or May; since 2001, it typically takes place in February.\n\nHistory\nThe British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) was founded in 1947 as The British Film Academy, by David Lean, Alexander Korda, Carol Reed, Charles Laughton, Roger Manvell, Laurence Olivier, Emeric Pressburger, Michael Powell, Michael Balcon, and other major figures of the British film industry. In 1958, the Academy merged with The Guild of Television Producers and Directors to form The Society of Film and Television, which eventually became The British Academy of Film and Television Arts in 1976.\nThe stated charitable purpose of BAFTA is to \"support, develop and promote the art forms of the moving image, by identifying and rewarding excellence, inspiring practitioners, and benefiting the public\". In addition to high-profile awards ceremonies, BAFTA runs a year-round programme of educational events, including film screenings and tribute evenings. BAFTA is supported by a membership of about 6,000 people from the film, television, and video game industries.\nThe Academy's awards are in the form of a theatrical mask designed by American sculptor Mitzi Cunliffe, in response to a commission from the Guild of Television Producers in 1955.\n\nAnnual ceremony\nThe ceremony previously took place in April or May, but since 2001 it has been held in February in order to precede the Academy Awards. Most of the awards are open to all nationalities, though there are awards for Outstanding British Film and Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Producer or Director. Only UK films are eligible for the categories of The British Short Film and British Short Animation awards.\nDuring each annual ceremony, BAFTA pauses in memoriam to pay tribute to those in the industry who have died over the past 12 months, showcasing a montage of images accompanied by music.\n\nBroadcast\nThe Awards ceremony has been historically delayed broadcast on British television the same evening, and across the world. The first broadcast was on the BBC in 1956, with Vivien Leigh (who would present an award to her husband Sir Laurence Olivier) as the host. It has been broadcast in colour since 1970. In the US it is broadcast on BBC America. In 2023, the BAFTA Film Awards included a live telecast for its major award categories during the culmination of the ceremony.\n\nLocation\nThe award ceremony is held in London. From 2000 to 2007, the ceremonies took place at the flagship Odeon Leicester cinema in Leicester Square. Between 2008 and 2016, the ceremonies took place at the Royal Opera House. The 70th Awards in 2017, and subsequent ceremonies up to the 75th Awards in 2022, were held at the Royal Albert Hall.\nFor the 76th British Academy Film Awards in 2023, it was announced that the ceremony would be moved to the Royal Festival Hall as part of a new multi-year deal between BAFTA and the Southbank Centre, bringing the Film Awards in-line with the British Academy Television Awards and British Academy Games Awards, which were already held there.\n\nSponsorship\nUntil 2012, the mobile telephone network Orange sponsored the awards.

In addition to its annual award ceremonies, BAFTA has an international programme of learning events and initiatives offering access to talent through workshops, masterclasses, scholarships, lectures, and mentoring schemes in the United Kingdom and the United States.\nBAFTA's annual film awards ceremony, the British Academy Film Awards, has taken place since 1949, while their annual television awards ceremony, the British Academy Television Awards, has taken place since 1955. Their third ceremony, the British Academy Games Awards, were first presented in 2004.\n\nOrigins\nBAFTA started out as the British Film Academy, founded in 1947 by a group of directors: David Lean, Alexander Korda, Roger Manvell, Laurence Olivier, Emeric Pressburger, Michael Powell, Michael Balcon, Carol Reed, and other major figures of the British film industry.\nDavid Lean was the founding chairman. The first Film Awards ceremony took place in May 1949, honouring the films The Best Years of Our Lives, Odd Man Out and The World Is Rich.\nThe Guild of Television Producers and Directors was set up in 1953 with the first awards ceremony in October 1954, and in 1958 merged with the British Film Academy to form the Society of Film and Television Arts, whose inaugural meeting was held at Buckingham Palace and presided over by the Duke of Edinburgh.\n\n195 Piccadilly\nThe Society of Film and Television Arts acquired the historic Prince's Hall facilities at 195 Piccadilly, following the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours' move to the Mall Galleries. Queen Elizabeth, The Duke of Edinburgh, The Princess Royal and The Earl Mountbatten of Burma officially opened the organisation's headquarters in 1976, and officially became the British Academy of Film and Television Arts in March 1976.\nIn 2016, BAFTA embarked in an extensive renovation of the Grade II listed property. Benedetti Architects oversaw a \u00a333M+ remodel, doubling its original capacity with the addition of an additional floor, raising and restoring two large Victorian rooflight structures and decorative plasterwork, creating an entire floor devoted to BAFTA's learning and new talent programmes, and revamping the property's food, beverage, and events operations in order to maximize revenue to sustain property maintenance and operations. The new facilities were formally reopened in 2022.\n\nCharitable mission\nBAFTA is a membership organization comprising approximately 8,000 individuals worldwide who are creatives and professionals working in and making a contribution to the film, television and games industries in the UK. In 2005, it placed an overall cap on worldwide voting membership which stood at approximately 6,500 as of 2017.\nBAFTA does not receive any funding from the government; it relies on income from membership subscriptions, individual donations, trusts, foundations and corporate partnerships to support its ongoing outreach work.\nBAFTA has offices in Scotland and Wales in the UK, in Los Angeles and New York in the United States and runs events in Hong Kong and mainland China.\nAmanda Berry served as chief executive of the organisation between December 2000 and October 2022. Jane Millichip has held the position since October 2022.\n\nLearning events and initiatives\nIn addition to its high-profile awards ceremonies, BAFTA manages a year-round programme of educational events and initiatives including film screenings and Q&As, tribute evenings, interviews, lectures, and debates with major industry figures. With over 250 events a year, BAFTA's stated aim is to inspire and inform the next generation of talent by providing a platform for some of the world's most talented practitioners to pass on their knowledge and experience.\nMany of these events are free to watch online at BAFTA Guru and via its official channel on YouTube.\n\nScholarships\nBAFTA runs a number of scholarship programmes across the UK, United States and Asia.\nLaunched in 2012, the UK programme enables talented British citizens who are in need of financial support to take an industry-recognised course in film, television or games in the UK. Each BAFTA Scholar receives up to \u00a312,000 towards their annual course fees, and mentoring support from a BAFTA member and free access to BAFTA events around the UK. Since 2013, three students every year have received one of the Prince William Scholarships in Film, Television and Games, supported by BAFTA and Warner Bros. These scholarships are awarded in the name of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge in his role as president of BAFTA.\nIn the U.S., BAFTA Los Angeles offers financial support and mentorship to British graduate students studying in the US, as well as scholarships to provide financial aid to local LA students from the inner city. BAFTA New York's Media Studies Scholarship Program, set up in 2012, supports students pursuing media studies at undergraduate and graduate level institutions within the New York City area and includes financial aid and mentoring opportunities.\nSince 2015, BAFTA has been offering scholarships for British citizens to study in China, and vice versa.\n\nAwards\nBAFTA presents awards for film, television and games, including children's entertainment, at a number of annual ceremonies across the UK and in Los Angeles.\n\nBAFTA awards\nThe BAFTA award trophy is a mask, designed by American sculptor Mitzi Cunliffe. When the Guild merged with the British Film Academy to become the Society of Film and Television Arts, later the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, the first \"BAFTA award\" was presented to Sir Charles Chaplin on his Academy Fellowship that year.\nA BAFTA award \u2013 including the bronze mask and marble base \u2013 weighs 3.7 kg (8.2 lb) and measures 27 cm (11 in) high \u00d7 14 cm (5.5 in) wide \u00d7 8 cm (3.1 in) deep; the mask itself measures 16 cm (6.3 in) high \u00d7 14 cm (5.5 in) wide. They are made of phosphor bronze and cast in a Middlesex foundry.\nIn 2017, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts introduced new entry rules for British films starting from the 2018\/19 season to foster diversity.\n\nAwards ceremonies\nFilm Awards\nBAFTA's annual film awards ceremony is known as the British Academy Film Awards, or \"the BAFTAs\", and reward the best work of any nationality seen on British cinema screens during the preceding year. In 1949 the British Film Academy, as it was then known, presented the first awards for films made in 1947 and 1948. Since 2008 the ceremony has been held at the Royal Opera House in London's Covent Garden. It had been held in the Odeon cinema on Leicester Square since 2000.\nSince 2017, the BAFTA ceremony has been held at the Royal Albert Hall. The ceremony had been performed during April or May of each year, but beginning 2002 it has been held in February to precede the Academy Awards (Oscars) in the United States, making the BAFTA Film Awards a major precursor of the eventual annual results of the Oscar ceremonies since.\nIn order for a film to be considered for a BAFTA nomination, its first public exhibition must be displayed in a cinema and it must have a UK theatrical release for no fewer than seven days of the calendar year that corresponds to the upcoming awards. A movie must be of feature-length and movies from all countries are eligible in all categories, with the exception of the Alexander Korda Award for Outstanding British Film and Outstanding Debut which are for British films or individuals only.\n\nTelevision Awards and Television Craft Awards\nThe British Academy Television Awards ceremony usually takes place during April or May, with its sister ceremony, the British Academy Television Craft Awards, usually occurring within a few weeks of it.\nThe Television Awards, celebrating the best TV programmes and performances of the past year, are also often referred to simply as \"the BAFTAs\" or, to differentiate them from the movie awards, the \"BAFTA Television Awards\". They have been awarded annually since 1954. The first ever ceremony consisted of six categories. Until 1958, they were awarded by the Guild of Television Producers and Directors.\nFrom 1968 until 1997, BAFTA's Film and Television Awards were presented together, but from 1998 onwards they were presented at two separate ceremonies.\nThe Television Craft Awards celebrate the talent behind the programmes, such as individuals working in visual effects, production, and costume design.\nOnly British programmes are eligible \u2013 with the potential exception of the publicly voted Audience Award \u2013 but any cable, satellite, terrestrial or digital television stations broadcasting in the UK are eligible to submit entries, as are independent production companies who have produced programming for the channels. Individual performances can either be entered by the performers themselves or by the broadcasters. The programmes being entered must have been broadcast on or between 1 January and 31 December of the year preceding the awards ceremony.\nSince 2014 the \"BAFTA Television Awards\" have been open to TV programmes which are only broadcast online.\n\nGames Awards\nThe British Academy Games Awards ceremony traditionally takes place in March, shortly after the Film Awards ceremony in February.\nBAFTA first recognised video games and other interactive media at its inaugural BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Awards ceremony during 1998, the first major change of its rules since the admittance of television thirty years earlier. Among the first winning games were GoldenEye 007, Gran Turismo and interactive comedy MindGym, sharing the spotlight with the BBC News Online website which won the news category four years consecutively. These awards allowed the academy to recognise new forms of entertainment that were engaging new audiences and challenging traditional expressions of creativity.\nDuring 2003, the sheer ubiquity of interactive forms of entertainment and the breadth of genres and types of video games outgrew the combined ceremony, and the event was divided into the BAFTA Video Games Awards and the BAFTA Interactive Awards Despite making headlines with high-profile winners like Halo 2 and Half-Life 2 the interactive division was discontinued and disappeared from BAFTA's publicity material after only two ceremonies.\nDuring 2006, BAFTA announced its decision \"to give video games equal status with film and television\", and the academy now advertises video games as its third major topic in recognition of its importance as an art form of moving images. The same year the ceremony was performed at The Roundhouse by Chalk Farm Road in North London on 5 October and was televised for the first time on 17 October and was broadcast on the digital channel E4.\nBetween 2009 and 2019, the ceremonies have been performed at the London Hilton Park Lane and Tobacco Dock, and have been hosted by Dara \u00d3 Briain and Rufus Hound. In 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was announced that the ceremony was changing format from a live red-carpet ceremony at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London to an online show. The online show was presented by Dara \u00d3 Briain from his home and was watched by 720,000 globally.\nIn 2021 the 17th British Academy Games Awards was hosted by arts and entertainment presenter Elle Osili-Wood and was watched by a global audience of 1.5 million.\n\nChildren's Awards\nThe British Academy Children's Awards are presented annually during November to reward excellence in the art forms of the moving image intended for children. They have been awarded annually since 1969 except for 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe academy has a history of recognising and rewarding children's programming, presenting two awards at the 1969 ceremony \u2013 The Flame of Knowledge Award for Schools Programmes and the Harlequin Award for Children's Programmes.\nAs of 2010 the Awards ceremony includes 19 categories across movies, television, video games and online content.\nSince 2007 the Children's Awards have included a Kids Vote award, voted by children between seven and 14. The CBBC Me and My Movie award, a children's filmmaking initiative to inspire and enable children to make their own movies and tell their own stories, has been discontinued.\n\nBAFTA Student Film Awards\nBAFTA also hosts the annual BAFTA Student Film Awards as showcase for rising industry talent. The animation award was sponsored in 2017 and 2018 by animation studio Laika.\n\nPresidents and Vice-Presidents\nPresidents\n\nThe Duke of Edinburgh (1959\u20131965)\nThe Earl Mountbatten of Burma (1966\u20131972)\nThe Princess Royal (1973\u20132001)\nThe Lord Attenborough (2001\u20132010)\nThe Prince of Wales (2010\u2013present)\nVice-Presidents\n\nThe Lord Attenborough (1973\u20131995)\nThe Lord Puttnam (1995\u20132004)\nMichael Grade (2004\u20132010)\nDuncan Kenworthy (film) (2009\u20132015)\nSophie Turner Laing (television) (2010\u20132015)\nGreg Dyke (television) (2016\u2013present)\n\nRoyal connections\nWilliam, Prince of Wales has been the President of the Academy since February 2010.\nThe Prince's appointment follows a long tradition of royal involvement with the academy. Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was the first president of the Society of Film and Television Arts (SFTA) in 1959 to 1965, followed by Earl Mountbatten of Burma and the Princess Royal, who was its president from 1972 to 2001. It was the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh's generous donation of their share of profits from the film Royal Family that enabled the academy to move to its headquarters at 195 Piccadilly. The Prince of Wales succeeded the Lord Attenborough to become the  fifth President in the Academy's history.\n\nBAFTA Los Angeles\nBAFTA North America, founded in 1987 and currently chaired by Joyce Pierpoline, serves as the bridge between the Hollywood and British production and entertainment business communities. The BAFTA Los Angeles location hosts a series of events, including the Britannia Awards, the Awards Season Film and Television Tea Parties in January and September, and the annual Garden Party.\nBAFTA Los Angeles provides access to screenings, Q&As with creative talent, produces seminars with UK film and television executives and the Heritage Archive, featuring interviews with British members of the film and television industries. The Los Angeles location also hosts the Student Film Awards and has an active Scholarship Program offering financial support and mentorship to UK students studying in the US. It created The Inner City Cinema, a screening program providing free screenings of theatrical films to inner-city areas not served by theatres. The success of Inner City Cinema has led to further free screening programs extended to multiple inner-city parks through the academy's work with both the County of Los Angeles Department of Parks and Recreation (Parks After Dark) and The City of Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks (Teen Summer Camps).\n\nBritannia Awards\nThe Britannia Awards are BAFTA Los Angeles' highest accolade, a \"celebration of achievements honouring individuals and companies that have dedicated their careers to advancing the entertainment arts\". The Awards began in 1989 and usually take place in October\/November every year. There are no awards given to specific movies or TV programmes, only to individuals. During the first ten years, one award was given at each event, named the 'Britannia Award for Excellence in Film', but since 1999 the number of awards has increased.\nAwards given include \"The Stanley Kubrick Britannia Award for Excellence in Film\" (the original award was renamed during 2000 to honour director Stanley Kubrick), presented to an individual \"upon whose work is stamped the indelible mark of authorship and commitment, and who has lifted the craft to new heights\"; \"The John Schlesinger Britannia Award for Artistic Excellence in Directing\" (added during 2003 in honour of John Schlesinger); the \"Britannia Award for British Artist of the Year\"; and the \"Albert R.

In 2016, having reviewed the eligibility criteria for last year's awards, BAFTA Cymru now encourages Welsh individuals who have worked on Welsh or UK productions \u2013 rather than solely Welsh productions \u2013 to enter into any one of the 16 craft and performance categories, \"[ensuring] that BAFTA in Wales can recognise the work of talented individuals who are working on network productions in craft or performance roles across the UK.\"\n\nBAFTA New York\nBAFTA New York founded in 1996, recognises and promotes the achievements of British film and television in New York and all along the East Coast of the US.\nIt hosts feature film, television and documentary screenings, panel discussions, premieres and co-produced events with other established organisations in the film and television industry, and runs an educational outreach program aimed at underserved youth in New York City that includes the BAFTA New York Media Studies Scholarship Program.\n\nControversy\nOn 26 October 2017, Norwegian actress Natassia Malthe accused Harvey Weinstein of raping her in a London hotel after the 2008 BAFTA Awards. On 2 February 2018, BAFTA formally terminated Weinstein's membership.\nOn 29 March 2021, Noel Clarke received the BAFTA Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema Award. This was suspended on 29 April 2021 following the publication of multiple and detailed accounts of sexual misconduct by The Guardian. Clarke has denied all allegations, except one. Clarke said: \"I vehemently deny any sexual misconduct or criminal wrongdoing.\" The allegations were made by twenty different women. BAFTA was informed about the existence of allegations of verbal abuse, bullying and sexual harassment against Clarke thirteen days before presenting Clarke with his award. BAFTA acknowledges it received anonymous emails and reports of allegations via intermediaries, but, as it was not given evidence that would allow it to investigate, was unable to take action.  In March 2022, the Metropolitan Police stated that Clarke would not face a criminal investigation due to a lack of evidence of any crimes having been committed.\n\nNotable people\nAnnika Small\n\nSee also\nAcademy Awards\nBAFTA Academy Fellowship Award\nAlbert Sustainable Production Certification\nNational Film Awards UK\nDaily Mail National Film Awards (now defunct 1946\u20131951)\nBritish Academy Children's Awards\nBritish Academy Television Craft Awards\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nOfficial awards database","38":"Castle of Sand (\u7802\u306e\u5668, Suna no utsuwa) is a 1974 Japanese police procedural film directed by Yoshitar\u014d Nomura, based on the novel Suna no Utsuwa by Seicho Matsumoto.\n\nPlot\nThe film tells the tale of two detectives, Imanishi (Tetsuro Tamba) and Yoshimura (Kensaku Morita), tasked with tracking down the murderer of an old man, found bludgeoned to death in a rail yard.

Historically, a bureaucracy was a government administration managed by departments staffed with non-elected officials. Today, bureaucracy is the administrative system governing any large institution, whether publicly owned or privately owned. The public administration in many jurisdictions is an example of bureaucracy, as is any centralized hierarchical structure of an institution, including corporations, societies, nonprofit organisations, and clubs.\nThere are two key dilemmas in bureaucracy. The first dilemma revolves around whether bureaucrats should be autonomous or directly accountable to their political masters. The second dilemma revolves around bureaucrats' responsibility to follow preset rules, and what degree of latitude they may have to determine appropriate solutions for circumstances that are unaccounted for in advance.\nVarious commentators have argued for the necessity of bureaucracies in modern society. The German sociologist Max Weber argued that bureaucracy constitutes the most efficient and rational way in which human activity can be organized and that systematic processes and organized hierarchies are necessary to maintain order, maximize efficiency, and eliminate favoritism. On the other hand, Weber also saw unfettered bureaucracy as a threat to individual freedom, with the potential of trapping individuals in an impersonal \"iron cage\" of rule-based, rational control.\n\nEtymology and usage\nThe term bureaucracy originated in the French language: it combines the French word bureau \u2013 'desk' or 'office' \u2013 with the Greek word \u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 (kratos) \u2013 'rule' or 'political power'. The French economist Jacques Claude Marie Vincent de Gournay coined the word in the mid-18th century. Gournay never wrote the term down but a letter from a contemporary later quoted him:\n\nThe late M. de Gournay... sometimes used to say: \"We have an illness in France which bids fair to play havoc with us; this illness is called bureaumania.\" Sometimes he used to invent a fourth or fifth form of government under the heading of \"bureaucracy.\"\nThe first known English-language use dates to 1818 with Irish novelist Lady Morgan referring to the apparatus used by the British government to subjugate Ireland as \"the Bureaucratie, or office tyranny, by which Ireland has so long been governed\". By the mid-19th century the word appeared in a more neutral sense, referring to a system of public administration in which offices were held by unelected career officials. In this context bureaucracy was seen as a distinct form of management, often subservient to a monarchy. \nIn the 1920s the German sociologist Max Weber expanded the definition to include any system of administration conducted by trained professionals according to fixed rules. Weber saw bureaucracy as a relatively positive development; however, by 1944 the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises opined in the context of his experience in the Nazi regime that the term bureaucracy was \"always applied with an opprobrious connotation\", and by 1957 the American sociologist Robert Merton suggested that the term bureaucrat had become an \"epithet, a Schimpfwort\" in some circumstances.\nThe word bureaucracy is also used in politics and government with a disapproving tone to disparage official rules that appear to make it difficult\u2014by insistence on procedure and compliance to rule, regulation, and law\u2014to get things done. In workplaces, the word is used very often to blame complicated rules, processes, and written work that are interpreted as obstacles rather than safeguards and accountability assurances. Socio-bureaucracy would then refer to certain social influences that may affect the function of a society.\nIn modern usage, modern bureaucracy has been defined as comprising four features:\n\nhierarchy (clearly defined spheres of competence and divisions of labor)\ncontinuity (a structure where administrators have a full-time salary and advance within the structure)\nimpersonality (prescribed rules and operating rules rather than arbitrary actions)\nexpertise (officials are chosen according to merit, have been trained, and hold access to knowledge)\nBureaucracy in a political theory is mainly a centralized form of management and tends to be differentiated from adhocracy, in which management tends more to decentralization.\n\nHistory\nAncient\nAlthough the term bureaucracy first originated in the mid-18th century, organized and consistent administrative systems existed much earlier. The development of writing (c. 3500 BC) and the use of documents was a critical component of such systems. The first definitive example of bureaucracy occurred in ancient Sumer, where an emergent class of scribes used clay tablets to document and carry out various administrative functions, such as the management of taxes, workers, and public goods\/resources like granaries. Similarly, Ancient Egypt had a hereditary class of scribes that administered a civil-service bureaucracy.\nIn China, when the Qin dynasty (221\u2013206 BC) unified China under the Legalist system, the emperor assigned administration to dedicated officials rather than nobility, ending feudalism in China, replacing it with a centralized, bureaucratic government. The form of government created by the first emperor and his advisors was used by later dynasties to structure their own government. Under this system, the government thrived, as talented individuals could be more easily identified in the transformed society. The Han dynasty (202 BC \u2013 220 AD) established a complicated bureaucracy based on the teachings of Confucius, who emphasized the importance of ritual in family, relationships, and politics. With each subsequent dynasty, the bureaucracy evolved. In 165 BC, Emperor Wen introduced the first method of recruitment to civil service through examinations. Emperor Wu (r. 141\u201387 BC) cemented the ideology of Confucius into mainstream governance by installing a system of recommendation and nomination in government service known as xiaolian, and a national academy where officials would select candidates to take part in an examination of the Confucian classics, from which Emperor Wu would select officials.\nIn the Sui dynasty (581\u2013618) and the subsequent Tang dynasty (618\u2013907) the shi class would begin to present itself by means of the fully standardized civil service examination system, of partial recruitment of those who passed standard exams and earned an official degree. Yet recruitment by recommendations to office was still prominent in both dynasties. It was not until the Song dynasty (960\u20131279) that the recruitment of those who passed the exams and earned degrees was given greater emphasis and significantly expanded. During the Song dynasty (960\u20131279) the bureaucracy became meritocratic. Following the Song reforms, competitive examinations took place to determine which candidates qualified to hold given positions. The imperial examination system lasted until 1905, six years before the Qing dynasty collapsed, marking the end of China's traditional bureaucratic system.\nA hierarchy of regional proconsuls and their deputies administered the Roman Empire. The reforms of Diocletian (Emperor from 284 to 305) doubled the number of administrative districts and led to a large-scale expansion of Roman bureaucracy. The early Christian author Lactantius (c. 250 \u2013 c. 325) claimed that Diocletian's reforms led to widespread economic stagnation, since \"the provinces were divided into minute portions, and many presidents and a multitude of inferior officers lay heavy on each territory.\" After the Empire split, the Byzantine Empire developed a notoriously complicated administrative hierarchy, and in the 20th century the term Byzantine came to refer to any complex bureaucratic structure.\n\nModern\nPersia\nUzun Hasan's conquest of most of mainland Iran shifted the seat of power to the east, where the Aq Qoyunlu adopted Iranian customs for administration and culture. In the Iranian areas, Uzun Hasan preserved the previous bureaucratic structure along with its secretaries, who belonged to families that had in a number of instances served under different dynasties for several generations. The four top civil posts of the Aq Qoyunlu were all occupied by Iranians, which under Uzun Hasan included: the vizier, who led the great council (divan); the mostawfi al-mamalek, high-ranking financial accountants; the mohrdar, who affixed the state seal; and the marakur 'stable master', who supervised the royal court. Through the use of his increasing revenue, Uzun Hasan was able to buy the approval of the ulama (clergy) and the mainly Iranian urban elite, while also taking care of the impoverished rural inhabitants.\nThe Safavid state was one of checks and balance, both within the government and on a local level. At the apex of this system was the Shah, with total power over the state, legitimized by his bloodline as a sayyid, or descendant of Muhammad. To ensure transparency and avoid decisions being made that circumvented the Shah, a complex system of bureaucracy and departmental procedures had been put in place that prevented fraud. Every office had a deputy or superintendent, whose job was to keep records of all actions of the state officials and report directly to the Shah. The Shah himself exercised his own measures for keeping his ministers under control by fostering an atmosphere of rivalry and competitive surveillance. And since the Safavid society was meritocratic, and successions seldom were made on the basis of heritage, this meant that government offices constantly felt the pressure of being under surveillance and had to make sure they governed in the best interest of their leader, and not merely their own.\nThe Ottomans adopted Persian bureaucratic traditions and culture.\n\nRussia\nThe Russian autocracy survived the Time of Troubles and the rule of weak or corrupt tsars because of the strength of the government's central bureaucracy. Government functionaries continued to serve, regardless of the ruler's legitimacy or the boyar faction controlling the throne. In the 17th century, the bureaucracy expanded dramatically. The number of government departments (prikazy; sing., prikaz ) increased from twenty-two in 1613 to eighty by mid-century. Although the departments often had overlapping and conflicting jurisdictions, the central government, through provincial governors, was able to control and regulate all social groups, as well as trade, manufacturing, and even the Eastern Orthodox Church.\nThe tsarist bureaucracy, alongside the military, the judiciary and the Russian Orthodox Church, played a major role in solidifying and maintaining the rule of the Tsars in the Tsardom of Russia (1547\u20131721) and in the Russian Empire (1721\u20131917). In the 19th century, the forces of change brought on by the Industrial Revolution propelled many countries, especially in Europe, to significant social changes. However, due to the conservative nature of the Tsarist regime and its desire to maintain power and control, social change in Russia lagged behind that of Europe.\nRussian-speakers referred to bureaucrats as chinovniki (\u0447\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438) because of the rank or chin (\u0447\u0438\u043d) which they held.\n\nAshanti Empire\nThe government of the Ashanti Empire was built upon a sophisticated bureaucracy in Kumasi, with separate ministries which saw to the handling of state affairs. Ashanti's Foreign Office was based in Kumasi. Despite the small size of the office, it allowed the state to pursue complex negotiations with foreign powers. The Office was divided into departments that handled Ashanti relations separately with the British, French, Dutch, and Arabs. Scholars of Ashanti history, such as Larry Yarak and Ivor Wilkes, disagree over the power of this sophisticated bureaucracy in comparison to the Asantehene. However, both scholars agree that it was a sign of a highly developed government with a complex system of checks and balances.\n\nUnited Kingdom\nInstead of the inefficient and often corrupt system of tax farming that prevailed in absolutist states such as France, the Exchequer was able to exert control over the entire system of tax revenue and government expenditure. By the late 18th century, the ratio of fiscal bureaucracy to population in Britain was approximately 1 in 1300, almost four times larger than the second most heavily bureaucratized nation, France. Thomas Taylor Meadows, Britain's consul in Guangzhou, argued in his Desultory Notes on the Government and People of China (1847) that \"the long duration of the Chinese empire is solely and altogether owing to the good government which consists in the advancement of men of talent and merit only\", and that the British must reform their civil service by making the institution meritocratic. Influenced by the ancient Chinese imperial examination, the Northcote\u2013Trevelyan Report of 1854 recommended that recruitment should be on the basis of merit determined through competitive examination, candidates should have a solid general education to enable inter-departmental transfers, and promotion should be through achievement rather than \"preferment, patronage, or purchase\". This led to implementation of His Majesty's Civil Service as a systematic, meritocratic civil service bureaucracy.\nIn the British civil service, just as it was in China, entrance to the civil service was usually based on a general education in ancient classics, which similarly gave bureaucrats greater prestige. The Cambridge-Oxford ideal of the civil service was identical to the Confucian ideal of a general education in world affairs through humanism. Well into the 20th century, classics, literature, history and language remained heavily favoured in British civil service examinations. In the period of 1925\u20131935, 67 percent of British civil service entrants consisted of such graduates. Like the Chinese model's consideration of personal values, the British model also took personal physique and character into account.\n\nFrance\nLike the British, the development of French bureaucracy was influenced by the Chinese system. Under Louis XIV of France, the old nobility had neither power nor political influence, their only privilege being exemption from taxes. The dissatisfied noblemen complained about this \"unnatural\" state of affairs, and discovered similarities between absolute monarchy and bureaucratic despotism. With the translation of Confucian texts during the Enlightenment, the concept of a meritocracy reached intellectuals in the West, who saw it as an alternative to the traditional ancien regime of Europe. Western perception of China even in the 18th century admired the Chinese bureaucratic system as favourable over European governments for its seeming meritocracy; Voltaire claimed that the Chinese had \"perfected moral science\" and Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay advocated an economic and political system modeled after that of the Chinese.\nThe governments of China, Egypt, Peru and Empress Catherine II were regarded as models of Enlightened Despotism, admired by such figures as Diderot, D'Alembert and Voltaire.\nNapoleonic France adopted this meritocracy system  and soon saw a rapid and dramatic expansion of government, accompanied by the rise of the French civil service and its complex systems of bureaucracy. This phenomenon became known as \"bureaumania\". In the early 19th century, Napoleon attempted to reform the bureaucracies of France and other territories under his control by the imposition of the standardized Napoleonic Code. But paradoxically, that led to even further growth of the bureaucracy.\nFrench civil service examinations adopted in the late 19th century were also heavily based on general cultural studies. These features have been likened to the earlier Chinese model.\n\nOther industrialized nations\nBy the mid-19th century, bureaucratic forms of administration were firmly in place across the industrialized world. Thinkers like John Stuart Mill and Karl Marx began to theorize about the economic functions and power-structures of bureaucracy in contemporary life. Max Weber was the first to endorse bureaucracy as a necessary feature of modernity, and by the late 19th century bureaucratic forms had begun their spread from government to other large-scale institutions.\nWithin capitalist systems, informal bureaucratic structures began to appear in the form of corporate power hierarchies, as detailed in mid-century works like The Organization Man and The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit. Meanwhile, in the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc nations, a powerful class of bureaucratic administrators termed nomenklatura governed nearly all aspects of public life.\nThe 1980s brought a backlash against perceptions of \"big government\" and the associated bureaucracy. Politicians like Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan gained power by promising to eliminate government regulatory bureaucracies, which they saw as overbearing, and return economic production to a more purely capitalistic mode, which they saw as more efficient. In the business world, managers like Jack Welch gained fortune and renown by eliminating bureaucratic structures inside corporations. Still, in the modern world, most organized institutions rely on bureaucratic systems to manage information, process records, and administer complex systems, although the decline of paperwork and the widespread use of electronic databases is transforming the way bureaucracies function.\n\nTheories\nKarl Marx\nKarl Marx theorized about the role and function of bureaucracy in his Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right, published in 1843. In Philosophy of Right, Hegel had supported the role of specialized officials in public administration, although he never used the term bureaucracy himself. By contrast, Marx was opposed to bureaucracy. Marx posited that while corporate and government bureaucracy seem to operate in opposition, in actuality they mutually rely on one another to exist. He wrote that \"The Corporation is civil society's attempt to become state; but the bureaucracy is the state which has really made itself into civil society.\"\n\nLeon Trotsky\nLeon Trotsky developed a critical theory of the emerging Soviet bureaucracy during the early years of the Soviet Union. According to political scientist Thomas M. Twiss, Trotsky associated bureaucratism with authoritarianism, excessive centralism and conservatism. Social theorist Martin Krygier had noted the impact of Trotsky's post-1923 writings in shaping receptive views of bureaucracy among later Marxists and many non-Marxists. Twiss argued that Trotsky's theory of Soviet bureaucracy was essential for a study of Soviet history and understanding the process of capitalist restoration in Russia and Eastern Europe. Political scientist, Baruch Knei-Paz argued Trotsky had, above all others, written \"to show the historical and social roots of Stalinism\" as a bureaucratic system.\nOne of the predictions made by Trotsky in his 1936 work, The Revolution Betrayed, was that the USSR would come before a disjuncture: either the toppling of the ruling bureaucracy by means of a political revolution, or capitalist restoration led by the bureaucracy:\n\nThe fall of the present bureaucratic dictatorship, if it were not replaced by a new socialist power, would thus mean a return to capitalist relations with a catastrophic decline of industry and culture.\n\nJohn Stuart Mill\nWriting in the early 1860s, political scientist John Stuart Mill theorized that successful monarchies were essentially bureaucracies, and found evidence of their existence in Imperial China, the Russian Empire, and the regimes of Europe. Mill referred to bureaucracy as a distinct form of government, separate from representative democracy. He believed bureaucracies had certain advantages, most importantly the accumulation of experience in those who actually conduct the affairs. Nevertheless, he believed this form of governance compared poorly to representative government, as it relied on appointment rather than direct election. Mill wrote that ultimately the bureaucracy stifles the mind, and that \"a bureaucracy always tends to become a pedantocracy.\"\n\nMax Weber\nThe German sociologist Max Weber (1864-1920) was the first to study bureaucracy formally, and his works led to the popularization of this term. In his essay Bureaucracy, published in his magnum opus, Economy and Society in 1921, Weber described many ideal-typical forms of public administration, government, and  business. His ideal-typical bureaucracy, whether public or private, is characterized by:\n\nhierarchical organization\nformal lines of authority (chain of command)\na fixed area of activity\nrigid division of labor\nregular and continuous execution of assigned tasks\nall decisions and powers specified and restricted by regulations\nofficials with expert training in their fields\ncareer advancement dependent on technical qualifications\nqualifications evaluated by organizational rules, not by individuals\nWeber listed several preconditions for the emergence of bureaucracy, including an increase in the amount of space and population being administered, an increase in the complexity of the administrative tasks being carried out, and the existence of a monetary economy requiring a more efficient administrative system. Development of communication and transportation technologies make more efficient administration possible, and democratization and rationalization of culture results in demands for equal treatment.\nAlthough he was not necessarily an admirer of bureaucracy, Weber saw bureaucratization as the most efficient and rational way of organizing human activity and therefore as the key to rational-legal authority, indispensable to the modern world. Furthermore, he saw it as the key process in the ongoing rationalization of Western society. Weber also saw bureaucracy, however, as a threat to individual freedoms, and ongoing bureaucratization as leading to a \"polar night of icy darkness\", in which increasing rationalization of human life traps individuals in a soulless \"iron cage\" of bureaucratic, rule-based, rational control. Weber's critical study of the bureaucratization of society became one of the most enduring parts of his work. Many aspects of modern public administration are based on his work, and a classic, hierarchically organized civil service of the Continental type is called a \"Weberian civil service\" or a \"Weberian bureaucracy\". Social scientists debate whether Weberian bureaucracy contributes to economic growth.\nPolitical scientist Jan Vogler challenges Max Weber's characterization of modern bureaucracies. Specifically, he questions Weber's views regarding strict merit recruitment, clearly delineated career-paths for bureaucrats, the full separation of bureaucratic operations from politics, and mutually exclusive spheres of competence for government agencies. Because he considers that the overwhelming majority of existing public administrative systems violate several of these aspects,  Vogler provides an alternative view of the defining organizational features of modern bureaucracies. According to this view, modern public bureaucracies are \"(internally hierarchical) administrative organizations ... subordinated to the government\" that have all of the following characteristics:\n\na full separation of offices and officeholders (i.e., no private possession of administrative positions)\nrecruitment procedures focused on relevant skills and ensuring at least minimal competence\nwritten rules and regulations that set standards for official conduct\nstable salaries and salary progression, mostly determined by individual bureaucratic rank\nlimited discretion in bureaucrats' work-routines and an overall political-legal orientation of the administrative system\nVogler considers modern bureaucracies as only requiring \"minimal competence\" from candidates for bureaucratic offices. This leaves space for the possibility of biases in recruitment processes that give preferential treatment to members of specific social, economic, or ethnic groups, which are observed in many real-world bureaucratic systems. Moreover, Vogler's perspective does not portray bureaucracies as strictly separated from politics and does not require government agencies to have mutually exclusive spheres of influence, which is in line with frequent inter-agency collaboration and conflict over disputed areas of competence in existing public administrations.\n\nWoodrow Wilson\nWriting as an academic while a professor at Bryn Mawr College, Woodrow Wilson's essay The Study of Administration argued for bureaucracy as a professional cadre, devoid of allegiance to fleeting politics. Wilson advocated a bureaucracy that: \n...is a part of political life only as the methods of the counting house are a part of the life of society; only as machinery is part of the manufactured product. But it is, at the same time, raised very far above the dull level of mere technical detail by the fact that through its greater principles it is directly connected with the lasting maxims of political wisdom, the permanent truths of political progress. Wilson did not advocate a replacement of rule by the governed, he simply advised that, \"Administrative questions are not political questions. Although politics sets the tasks for administration, it should not be suffered to manipulate its offices\". This essay became a foundation for the study of public administration in America.\n\nLudwig von Mises\nIn his 1944 work Bureaucracy, the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises compared bureaucratic management to profit management. Profit management, he argued, is the most effective method of organization when the services rendered may be checked by economic calculation of profit and loss. When, however, the service in question cannot be subjected to economic calculation, bureaucratic management is necessary. He did not oppose universally bureaucratic management; on the contrary, he argued that bureaucracy is an indispensable method for social organization, for it is the only method by which the law can be made supreme, and is the protector of the individual against despotic arbitrariness. Using the example of the Catholic Church, he pointed out that bureaucracy is only appropriate for an organization whose code of conduct is not subject to change. He then went on to argue that complaints about bureaucratization usually refer not to the criticism of the bureaucratic methods themselves, but to \"the intrusion of bureaucracy into all spheres of human life.\" Mises saw bureaucratic processes at work in both the private and public spheres; however, he believed that bureaucratization in the private sphere could only occur as a consequence of government interference. According to him, \"What must be realized is only that the strait jacket  of bureaucratic organization paralyzes the individual's initiative, while within the capitalist market society an innovator still has a chance to succeed. The former makes for stagnation and preservation of inveterate methods, the latter makes for progress and improvement.\"\n\nRobert K. Merton\nAmerican sociologist Robert K. Merton expanded on Weber's theories of bureaucracy in his work Social Theory and Social Structure, published in 1957. While Merton agreed with certain aspects of Weber's analysis, he also noted the dysfunctional aspects of bureaucracy, which he attributed to a \"trained incapacity\" resulting from \"over conformity\". He believed that bureaucrats are more likely to defend their own entrenched interests than to act to benefit the organization as a whole but that pride in their craft makes them resistant to changes in established routines. Merton stated that bureaucrats emphasize formality over interpersonal relationships, and have been trained to ignore the special circumstances of particular cases, causing them to come across as \"arrogant\" and \"haughty\".\n\nElliott Jaques\nIn his book A General Theory of Bureaucracy, first published in 1976, Elliott Jaques describes the discovery of a universal and uniform underlying structure of managerial or work levels in the bureaucratic hierarchy for any type of employment systems.\nJaques argues and presents evidence that for the bureaucracy to provide a valuable contribution to the open society some of the following conditions must be met:\n\nThe number of levels in the hierarchy of a bureaucracy must match the complexity level of the employment system for which the bureaucratic hierarchy is created. (Jaques identified a maximum of eight levels of complexity for bureaucratic hierarchies.)\nRoles within a bureaucratic hierarchy differ in the level of work complexity.\nThe level of work complexity in the roles must be matched by the level of human capability of the role holders. (Jaques identified maximum of eight levels of human capability.)\nThe level of work complexity in any managerial role within a bureaucratic hierarchy must be one level higher than the level of work complexity of the subordinate roles.\nAny managerial role in a bureaucratic hierarchy must have full managerial accountabilities and authorities (veto selection to the team, decide task types and specific task assignments, decide personal effectiveness and recognition, decide initiation of removal from the team within due process).\nLateral working accountabilities and authorities must be defined for all the roles in the hierarchy (seven types of lateral working accountabilities and authorities: collateral, advisory, service-getting and -giving, coordinative, monitoring, auditing, prescribing).\n\nBureaucracy and democracy\nLike every modern state, a liberal democracy is highly bureaucratized, with numerous sizable organizations filled with career civil servants. Some of those bureaucracies have a substantial amount of influence to preserve the current political system because they are primarily focused on defending the country and the state from threats from both within and beyond. Since these institutions frequently operate independently and are mostly shielded from politics, they frequently have no affiliation with any particular political party or group. For instance, loyal British civil officials work for both the Conservative and Labour parties. However, on occasion a group might seize control of a bureaucratic state, as the Nazis did in Germany in the 1930s.\nAlthough numerous ideals associated with democracy, such as equality, participation, and individuality, are in stark contrast to those associated with modern bureaucracy, specifically hierarchy, specialization, and impersonality, political theorists did not recognize bureaucracy as a threat to democracy. Yet democratic theorists still have not developed a sufficient solution to the problem bureaucratic authority poses to democratic government.\nOne answer to this problem is to say that bureaucracy has no place at all in a real democracy. Theorists who adopt this perspective typically understand that they must demonstrate that bureaucracy does not necessarily occur in every contemporary society; only in those they perceive to be non-democratic. Because their democracy was resistant to bureaucracy, nineteenth-century British writers frequently referred to it as the \"Continental nuisance\".\nAccording to Marx and other socialist thinkers, the most advanced bureaucracies were those in France and Germany. However, they argued that bureaucracy was a symptom of the bourgeois state and would vanish along with capitalism, which gave rise to the bourgeois state. Though clearly not the democracies Marx had in mind, socialist societies ended up being more bureaucratic than the governments they replaced. Similarly, after capitalist economies developed the administrative systems required to support their extensive welfare states, the idea that bureaucracy exclusively exists in socialist governments could scarcely be maintained.\n\nSee also\nAdhocracy\nAnarchy\nAuthority\nCivil servant\nHierarchical organization\nMachinery of government\nMichel Crozier\nOutline of organizational theory\nPower (social and political)\nPublic administration\nRed tape\nRequisite organization\nState (polity)\nTechnocracy\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\n\nAlbrow, Martin.

English translation of \"Bureaucracy\" by Max Weber.","40":"A cautionary tale or moral tale is a tale told in folklore to warn its listener of a danger. There are three essential parts to a cautionary tale, though they can be introduced in a large variety of ways.  First, a taboo or prohibition is stated: some act, location, or thing is said to be dangerous. Then, the narrative itself is told: someone disregarded the warning and performed the forbidden act. Finally, the violator comes to an unpleasant fate, which is frequently related in expansive and grisly detail.\n\nCautionary tales and conformity\nCautionary tales are ubiquitous in popular culture; many urban legends are framed as cautionary tales: from the lover's lane haunted by a hook-handed murderer to the tale of a man who shot a cactus for fun only to die when the plant toppled onto him. Like horror fiction, generally the cautionary tale exhibits an ambivalent attitude towards social taboos.  The narrator of a cautionary tale is momentarily excused from the ordinary demands of etiquette that discourages the use of gruesome or disgusting imagery because the tale serves to reinforce some other social taboo.\nCautionary tales are also frequently utilized to spread awareness of moral issues. For this reason, they are often told to children to make them conform to rules that either protect them or are for their own safety.\nThose whose job it is to enforce conformity therefore frequently resort to cautionary tales. The German language anthology, Struwwelpeter, contains tales such as \"Die gar traurige Geschichte mit dem Feuerzeug\" (The Dreadful Story of Pauline and the Matches); it is fairly easy to deduce the ending from the title.  Social guidance films such as Boys Beware or Reefer Madness are deliberately patterned after traditional cautionary tales, as were the notorious driver's education films (Red Asphalt, Signal 30) of the 1960s, or military films about syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases.  The framework of the cautionary tale became a clich\u00e9 in the slasher films of the 1980s, in which adolescents who had sex, drank alcoholic beverages, or smoked marijuana inevitably ended up as the victims of the serial killer villain.\nOn the other hand, in the adolescent culture of the United States, for more than a hundred years the traditional cautionary tale gave rise to the phenomenon of legend tripping, in which a cautionary tale is turned into the basis of a dare that invites the hearer to test the taboo by breaking it.\nThe cautionary tale has survived to the present day in another form, especially with the rise of modern mass media such as film and television; many public service announcements and public information films frame themselves as cautionary tales regarding both societal issues and common dangers in modern life, pushing conformity by warning viewers of the danger and directing them towards avoiding the causes, or simply not doing actions that result in such dangers.\n\nReactions to cautionary tales\nThe genre of the cautionary tale has been satirized by several writers. Hilaire Belloc in his Cautionary Tales for Children presented such moral examples as \"Jim, Who ran away from his Nurse, and was eaten by a Lion\", and \"Matilda, Who told lies, and was Burned to Death\". Lewis Carroll, in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, says that Alice:\n\n... had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:  such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked \"poison\", it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.\nIn The Complete Tribune Printer, Eugene Field gave cautionary tales an ironic inversion, as in The Gun:\n\nThis is a gun. Is the Gun loaded? Really, I do not know. Let us Find out. Put the Gun on the table, and you, Susie, blow down one barrel while you, Charlie, blow down the other. Bang! Yes, it was loaded. Run quick, Jennie, and pick up Susie's head and Charlie's lower Jaw before the Nasty Blood gets over the New carpet.\nSome films, such as Gremlins, satirized this framework by imposing very arbitrary rules whose violation results in horrendous consequences for the community by not taking responsibility.\nCautionary tales are sometimes heavily criticized for their ham-fisted approach to ethics. The Cold Equations is a well-known example. In the story, a man has to eject a young woman out of the airlock, otherwise the fuel of his rocket will not suffice to deliver some badly needed serum, without which everyone at a small outpost would perish. Her death is justified because she ignored a 'no entry' sign, \"when the laws of physics say no, they don't mean maybe\", and no other solution would reduce the weight of the ship enough to complete the trip safely.\n\nSee also\nMorphology (folkloristics)\nDarwin Awards\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nClover, Carol J.

Since 2022, it is the flagship paper of the non-profit Chicago Public Media, and has long held the second largest circulation among Chicago newspapers, after the Chicago Tribune. \nThe Sun-Times resulted from the 1948 merger of the Chicago Sun and the Chicago Daily Times newspapers. Journalists at the paper have received eight Pulitzer Prizes, mostly in the 1970s; one recipient was the first film critic to receive the prize, Roger Ebert (1975), who worked at the paper from 1967 until his death in 2013. Long owned by the Marshall Field family, since the 1980s ownership of the paper has changed hands several times, including twice in the late 2010s.\n\nHistory\nThe Chicago Sun-Times claims to be the oldest continuously published daily newspaper in the city.  That claim is based on the 1844 founding of the Chicago Daily Journal, which was also the first newspaper to publish the rumor, now believed false, that a cow owned by Catherine O'Leary was responsible for the Chicago fire. The Evening Journal, whose West Side building at 17\u201319 S. Canal was undamaged, gave the Chicago Tribune a temporary home until it could rebuild. Though the assets of the Journal were sold to the Chicago Daily News in 1929, its last owner Samuel Emory Thomason also immediately launched the tabloid Chicago Daily Illustrated Times.\nThe modern paper grew out of the 1948 merger of the Chicago Sun, founded by Marshall Field III on December 4, 1941, and the Chicago Daily Times (which had dropped the \"Illustrated\" from its title) published from 1929 to 1948. The newspaper was owned by Field Enterprises, controlled by the Marshall Field family, which acquired the afternoon Chicago Daily News in 1959 and launched WFLD television in 1966. When the Daily News ended its run in 1978, much of its staff, including Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Mike Royko, were moved to the Sun-Times. During the Field period, the newspaper had a populist, progressive character that leaned Democratic but was independent of the city's Democratic establishment. Although the graphic style was urban tabloid, the paper was well regarded for journalistic quality and did not rely on sensational front-page stories. It typically ran articles from The Washington Post\/Los Angeles Times wire service.\n\nThe 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s\nAmong the most prominent members of the newspaper's staff was cartoonist Jacob Burck, who was hired by the Chicago Times in 1938, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1941 and continued with the paper after it became the Sun-Times, drawing nearly 10,000 cartoons over a 44-year career.\nThe advice column \"Ask Ann Landers\" debuted in 1943. Ann Landers was the pseudonym of staff writer Ruth Crowley, who answered readers' letters until 1955. Eppie Lederer, sister of \"Dear Abby\" columnist Abigail van Buren, assumed the role thereafter as Ann Landers.\n\"Kup's Column\", written by Irv Kupcinet, also made its first appearance in 1943.\nJack Olsen joined the Sun-Times as editor-in-chief in 1954, before moving on to Time and Sports Illustrated magazines and authoring true-crime books. Hired as literary editor in 1955 was Hoke Norris, who also covered the civil-rights movement for the Sun-Times.\nJerome Holtzman became a member of the Chicago Sun sports department after first being a copy boy for the Daily News in the 1940s. He and Edgar Munzel, another longtime sportswriter for the paper, both would end up honored by the Baseball Hall of Fame.\nFamed for his World War II exploits, two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Bill Mauldin made the Sun-Times his home base in 1962. The following year, Mauldin drew one of his most renowned illustrations, depicting a mourning statue of Abraham Lincoln after the November 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy.\nTwo years out of college, Roger Ebert became a staff writer in 1966, and a year later was named Sun-Times's film critic. He continued in this role for the remainder of his life.\n\nThe 1970s\nIn 1975, a new sports editor at the Sun-Times, Lewis Grizzard, spiked some columns written by sportswriter Lacy J. Banks and took away a column Banks had been writing, prompting Banks to tell a friend at the Chicago Defender that Grizzard was a racist. After the friend wrote a story about it, Grizzard fired Banks. With that, the editorial employees union intervened, a federal arbitrator ruled for Banks, and 13 months later he got his job back.\nA 25-part series on the Mirage Tavern, a saloon on Wells Street bought and operated by the Sun-Times in 1977, exposed a pattern of civic corruption and bribery, as city officials were investigated and photographed without their knowledge. The articles received considerable publicity and acclaim, but a nomination for the Pulitzer Prize met resistance from some who believed the Mirage series represented a form of entrapment.\nIn March 1978, the venerable afternoon publication the Chicago Daily News, sister paper of the Sun-Times, went out of business. The two newspapers shared the same ownership and office building. James F. Hoge, Jr., editor and publisher of the Daily News, assumed the same positions at the Sun-Times, which also retained a number of the Daily News's editorial personnel.\n\nThe 1980s\nIn 1980, the Sun-Times hired syndicated TV columnist Gary Deeb away from the rival Chicago Tribune. Deeb then left the Sun-Times in the spring of 1983 to try his hand at TV.  He joined Chicago's WLS-TV in September 1983.\nIn July 1981, prominent Sun-Times investigative reporter Pam Zekman, who had been part of a Pulitzer Prize-winning team with the Chicago Tribune in 1976, announced she was leaving the Sun-Times to join WBBM-TV in Chicago in August 1981 as chief of its new investigative unit.  \"Salary wasn't a factor,\" she told the Tribune.  \"The station showed a commitment to investigative journalism.  It was something I wanted to try.\"\nPete Souza left the Sun-Times in 1983 to become official White House photographer for President Ronald Reagan until his second term's end in 1989. Souza returned to that position to be the official photographer for President Barack Obama.\nBaseball writer Jerome Holtzman defected from the Sun-Times to the Tribune in late 1981, while Mike Downey also left Sun-Times sports in September 1981 to be a columnist at the Detroit Free Press.\nIn January 1984, noted Sun-Times business reporter James Warren quit to join the rival Chicago Tribune. He became the Tribune's Washington bureau chief and later its managing editor for features.\nIn 1984, Field Enterprises co-owners, half-brothers Marshall Field V and Ted Field, sold the paper to Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, and the paper's style changed abruptly to mirror that of its suitemate, the New York Post. Its front pages tended more to the sensational, while its political stance shifted markedly to the right. This was in the era that the Chicago Tribune had begun softening its traditionally staunchly Republican editorial line, blurring the city's clear division between the two newspapers' politics. This shift was made all but official when Mike Royko defected to the Tribune.\n\nRoger Ebert later reflected on the incident with disdain, stating in his blog, On the first day of Murdoch's ownership, he walked into the newsroom and we all gathered around and he recited the usual blather and rolled up his shirtsleeves and started to lay out a new front page. Well, he was a real newspaperman, give him that. He threw out every meticulous detail of the beautiful design, ordered up big, garish headlines, and gave big play to a story about a North Shore rabbi accused of holding a sex slave.\nThe story turned out to be fatally flawed, but so what? It sold papers. Well, actually, it didn't sell papers. There were hundreds of cancellations. Soon our precious page 3 was defaced by a daily Wingo girl, a pinup in a bikini promoting a cash giveaway. The Sun-Times, which had been placing above the Tribune in lists of the 10 best U.S. newspapers, never took that great step it was poised for.\nMurdoch sold the paper in 1986 (to buy its former sister television station WFLD to launch the Fox network) for $145 million in cash in a leveraged buyout to an investor group led by the paper's publisher, Robert E. Page, and the New York investment firm Adler & Shaykin.\nIn 1984, Roger Simon, who had been a Sun-Times columnist for a decade, quit to join The Baltimore Sun, where he worked until 1995.  Simon quit the paper because of Murdoch's purchase of it. Beginning in October 1984, Simon's columns from Baltimore began appearing in the rival Chicago Tribune.\nIn November of 1986, The Sun-Times acquired Star Publications, a chain of 12 south and southwest suburban papers published twice weekly, for an undisclosed sum.\nIn December 1986, the Sun-Times hired high-profile gossip columnist Michael Sneed away from the rival Chicago Tribune, where she had been co-authoring the Tribune's own \"Inc.\" gossip column with Kathy O'Malley.  On December 3, 1986, O'Malley led off the Tribune's \"Inc.\" column with the heading \"The Last to Know Dept.\" and writing, \"Dontcha just hate it when you write a gossip column and people think you know all the news about what's going on and your partner gets a new job and your column still has her name on it on the very same day that her new employer announces that she's going to work for him? Yeah, INC. just hates it when that happens.\"\nIn February 1987, the popular syndicated advice column \"Ask Ann Landers\" (commonly known as the \"Ann Landers\" column and written at that point by Eppie Lederer) left the Sun-Times after 31 years to jump to the rival Chicago Tribune, effective March 15, 1987.  The move sparked a nationwide hunt for a new advice columnist for the Sun-Times.  After more than 12,000 responses from people aged 4 to 85, the paper ultimately hired two: Jeffrey Zaslow, then a 28-year-old Wall Street Journal reporter, and Diane Crowley, a 47-year-old lawyer, teacher and daughter of Ruth Crowley, who had been the original Ann Landers columnist from 1943 until 1955. Crowley left to return to the practice of law in 1993 and the paper decided not to renew Zaslow's contract in 2001.\nBy the summer of 1988, Page and Adler & Shaykin managing partner Leonard P. Shaykin had developed a conflict, and in August 1988, Page resigned as publisher and president and sold his interest in the paper to his fellow investors.\nIn January of 1989, the Sun-Times company starts its plans to purchase The Pioneer_Press and its 38 different weekly publications.\n\nThe 1990s\nIn mid-1991, veteran crime reporter Art Petacque, who had won a Pulitzer Prize in 1974, left the paper.  Almost ten years later, Dennis Britton, who had been the paper's editor at the time of Petacque's retirement, told the Chicago Reader that Petacque's departure, which was described at the time as a retirement, was involuntary.  \"I had problems with some of the ways Art pursued his job,\" Britton told the Reader.\nIn September 1992, Bill Zwecker joined the Sun-Times as a gossip columnist from the troubled Lerner Newspapers suburban weekly newspaper chain, where he had written the \"VIPeople\" column.\nIn September 1992, Sun-Times sports clerk Peter Anding was arrested in the Sun-Times' newsroom and held without bond after confessing to using his position to set up sexual encounters for male high school athletes.  Anding was charged with aggravated criminal sexual assault and possession of child pornography.  In September 1993, Anding pleaded guilty to arranging and videotaping sexual encounters with several teenage boys and fondling others.  He was sentenced to 40 years in prison.\nIn 1993, the Sun-Times fired photographer Bob Black without severance for dozens of unauthorized uses of the company's Federal Express account and outside photo lab, going back more than three years and costing the company more than $1,400.  In February 1994, however, Black rejoined the paper's payroll after an arbitrator agreed with the paper's union that dismissal was too severe a penalty.  At the same time, the arbitrator declined to award Black back pay.\nIn 1993, longtime Sun-Times reporter Larry Weintraub retired after 35 years at the paper. Weintraub had been best known for his \"Weintraub's World\" column, in which he worked a job and wrote about the experience.  Weintraub died in 2001 at age 69.\nIn February 1994, the Adler & Shaykin investor group sold the Sun-Times to Hollinger Inc. for about $180 million.  Hollinger was controlled, indirectly, by Canadian-born businessman Conrad Black. After Black and his associate David Radler were indicted for skimming money from Hollinger International, through retaining noncompete payments from the sale of Hollinger newspapers, they were removed from the board, and Hollinger International was renamed the Sun-Times Media Group.\nIn 1994, noted reporter M.W. Newman retired from the Sun-Times around the age of 77.  Newman, who died of lung cancer in 2001, had been with the Sun-Times since the Chicago Daily News closed in 1978 and had focused his efforts on urban reporting.  Among other things, Newman had been known for coining the term \"Big John\" to describe the John Hancock Center and the expression \"Fortress Illini\" for the concrete structures and plazas at the University of Illinois at Chicago.\nOn March 23, 1995, the Sun-Times announced that beginning April 2, 1995, veteran Sports Illustrated writer Rick Telander would join the paper and write four columns a week.\nOn March 24, 1995, the Sun-Times published an editorial by Mark Hornung, then the Sun-Times' editorial page editor, that plagiarized a Washington Post editorial that had appeared in that paper the day before.  Hornung attributed the plagiarism to writer's block, deadline pressures and the demands of other duties.  He resigned as editorial page editor, but remained with the paper, shifting to its business side and working first as director of distribution and then as vice president of circulation.  In 2002, Hornung became president and publisher of Midwest Suburban Publishing, which was a company owned by then-Sun Times parent company Hollinger International.  In June 2004, Hollinger International placed Hornung on administrative leave just two weeks after Hollinger revealed that the paper's sales figures had been inflated for several years.  Hornung resigned from the company four days later.\nOn May 17, 1995, the Sun-Times' food section published a bogus letter from a reader named \"Olga Fokyercelf\" that Chicago Tribune columnist (and former Sun-Times columnist) Mike Royko called \"an imaginative prank\" in a column.  In that same column, Royko criticized the paper's food writer, who edited the readers' column at the time, Olivia Wu, for not following better quality control. The Wall Street Journal then criticized Royko with an article of its own, titled, \"Has a Curmudgeon Turned Into a Bully? Some Now Think So...Picking on a Food Writer.\"  Although the Sun-Times began hiring a freelancer to edit the space and look for double entendres, another one made it into the same column on July 26, 1995, when the section published a letter from a \"Phil McCraken.\"  \"This one was a little more subtle,\" a reporter outside the food department told the Chicago Reader.\n\nIn 1998, the Sun-Times demoted longtime TV critic Lon Grahnke, shifting him to covering education. Grahnke, who died in 2006 at age 56 of Alzheimer's disease, remained with the paper until 2001, when he retired following an extended medical leave.\n\nThe 2000s\nIn 2000, the Sun-Times new editors, Michael Cooke and John Cruickshank, tapped longtime staff reporter Mark Brown, who had considered himself an investigative reporter, to write a column that would anchor page two of the paper.\nIn 2000, longtime investigative reporter Charles Nicodemus retired from the paper at age 69 and died in 2008 at age 77.\nIn 2001, Sun-Times investigative reporter Chuck Neubauer quit the paper to join the Los Angeles Times' Washington bureau.  Neubauer and Brown had initiated the investigation into U.S. Rep. Dan Rostenkowski that uncovered a variety of misdeeds that ultimately had led to Rostenkowski's indictment, conviction and imprisonment.\nIn April 2001, Sun-Times architecture critic Lee Bey quit to join the administration of then-Chicago Mayor Richard M.

Smith had written since 1995.  Smith wrote the column from home, and the Sun-Times discontinued the column and informed Smith that it needed him back in the newsroom as a general assignment reporter.

The final arrangement was backed with $61 million from several philanthropic organizations.\nIn 2022 Jennifer Kho was appointed executive editor.

Chicago columnist Mike Royko, previously of the defunct Chicago Daily News, came to the paper in 1978 but left for the Chicago Tribune in 1984 when the Sun-Times was purchased by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.

Among those photographers who were laid off was Pulitzer Prize winning photographer John White.

It is published by Christianity Today International based in Carol Stream, Illinois. The Washington Post calls Christianity Today \"evangelicalism's flagship magazine\". The New York Times describes it as a \"mainstream evangelical magazine\". On August 4, 2022, Russell D. Moore\u2014notable for denouncing and leaving the leadership of the Southern Baptist Convention\u2014was named the incoming Christianity Today Editor-in-Chief.\nChristianity Today has a print circulation of approximately 110,000 and an online readership of 2.2 million at ChristianityToday.com. The founder, Billy Graham, stated that he wanted to \"plant the evangelical flag in the middle of the road, taking the conservative theological position but a definite liberal approach to social problems\". Other active publications currently active within Christianity Today include: Building Church Leaders which has vocational education materials for evangelists and clergy. Church Law & Tax which discusses tax compliance. ChristianBibleStudies helps with Bible studies. ChurchSalary helps churches with information on proper remuneration. Ekstasis Magazine about Christian arts and media, specifically to encourage creativity within Christian culture to enable better storytelling, worldbuilding, and cultural representation. PreachingToday is a publication specifically for those delivering sermons. SmallGroups is a leadership magazine for smaller church planting groups such as missional living, cafe churches, pub churches, or house churches.\nGraham began the magazine as counterpoint to The Christian Century, the predominant independent periodical of mainline Protestantism, and as a way to bring the evangelical Christian community together.\n\nHistory\nThe second issue of Christianity Today was created in the date of October 15, 1956, and the opening editorial, Why 'Christianity Today'?, stated \"Christianity Today has its origin in a deep-felt desire to express historical Christianity to the present generation. Neglected, slighted, misrepresented\u2014evangelical Christianity needs a clear voice, to speak with conviction and love, and to state its true position and its relevance to the world crisis. A generation has grown up unaware of the basic truths of the Christian faith taught in the Scriptures and expressed in the creeds of the historic evangelical churches.\"\nIts first editor was Carl F. H. Henry. Notable contributors in its first two decades included F. F. Bruce, Edward John Carnell, Frank Gaebelein, Walter Martin, John Warwick Montgomery, and Harold Lindsell. Lindsell succeeded Henry as editor and during his editorial administration much attention centered on debates about biblical inerrancy. Later editorial leadership came from Kenneth Kantzer, Terry Muck, and David Neff. V. Gilbert Beers was hired as the fourth editor in 1982, reportedly to increase the magazine's lay readership. From 2015 until January 3, 2020, Mark Galli was the editor in chief. Following Galli's retirement Daniel M. Harrell served as editor in chief for a year. Russell Moore took the position in August 2022.  The publication now includes print and online versions and various ancillary products. Print and online contents include feature stories, news ranging from cultural issues from a Christian viewpoint to the global church, opinion, reviews, and investigative reporting.\nIn Billy Graham's 1997 autobiography, Just As I Am, he writes of his vision, idea, and history with Christianity Today, and his early meeting with oil company executive, John Howard Pew, to establish the publication. Most critics label Christianity Today as a mainstream, intellectual, centrist evangelical publication.\n\nEditorials on impeachments of U.S. presidents\nOn June 7, 1974, in an editorial entitled \"Should Nixon Resign?\", published during the impeachment hearings of President Richard Nixon, Christianity Today wrote \"that the constitutional process should be followed, and followed with dispatch.\" The magazine did not call for his resignation, but instead stated that \"If he is acquitted, the nation will have to wait out the term of a President whose ability to function has been seriously eroded.\" On October 5, 1998, regarding the imminent impeachment of President Bill Clinton, Christianity Today stated in an editorial that \"Unsavory dealings and immoral acts by the president and those close to him\" have compromised his administration's moral leadership, criticizing his televised August 17 confession as a \"nonapology\".\nIn an editorial published on December 19, 2019, a day after the U.S. House of Representatives impeached President Donald Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, editor in chief Mark Galli asserted among other criticisms that he sought to leverage his political power \"to coerce a foreign leader to harass and discredit\" presidential candidate Joe Biden. He argued: \"That is not only a violation of the Constitution; more importantly, it is profoundly immoral.\" The editorial received extensive media coverage and caught the attention of Trump and his allies, who in response sought to discredit the publication, with the former describing it as \"far-left\", and almost 200 evangelical leaders rebuking it for the editorial.\n\nSexual harassment controversy\nIn 2022, the magazine published two articles announcing that a number of women reported demeaning, inappropriate, and offensive behavior by former editor in chief Mark Galli and former advertising director Olatokunbo Olawoye, whilst their behavior remained unchecked and the men were not disciplined, according to an external assessment of the ministry's culture. Speaking to Religion News Service, Galli admitted that he may have \"crossed lines\" during his time as editor but denied having had \"any romantic or sexual interest in anyone at Christianity Today.\" In an editorial on the magazine, the CEO of Christianity Today Timothy Dalrymple admitted that the society that owns and edits the magazine fell short on protecting the employees and apologized for the fact, promising strong and swift action against sexual harassment.\n\nPublications\nHarold Myra, who became president and chief executive of the magazine in 1975, believed that a \"family\" of magazines would disperse overhead expenses and give more stability to the organization. Christianity Today both online and magazine is the flagship publication, fully effective in three basic areas: editorial, circulation, advertising; as such, many of the articles from their broader publications often get distributed through CT's flagship. Christianity Today founded or acquired periodicals during the 1980s and 1990s, beginning with Leadership, a quarterly journal for clergy, in 1980.\n\nActive\nAt the ministry's web home, ChristianityToday.org, all other brands for Christian thought leaders and church leaders are featured, including publications such as the intellectual Christian review, Books & Culture, and the website for pastors and church leaders, CT Pastors. Additional web resources include Men of Integrity and Preaching Today. Many of the sections published online under the Christianity Today banner are the online legacies of defunct print publications, even named after the aforementioned publications.\n\nEkstasis (2016\u2013present)\nEkstasis is a journal that was acquired by Christianity Today in 2021, originally founded in 2016 by Conor Sweetman in Toronto, Canada it focuses on Christian arts and media.\n\nInternational editions (2007\u2013present)\nBesides English, it is available in 12 other languages: Arabic, Catalan, Chinese, Filipino, French, Galician, German, Indonesian, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish. Their publication can be found within those linguistic regions, as well as in Japan and Israel.\n\nOnline presence\nThe magazine's mission statement is to \"provide evangelical thought leaders a sense of community, coherence, and direction through thoughtful, biblical commentary on issues and through careful, caring reporting of the news.\" Its presence on the Internet began in October 1994 when it became one of the top ten content providers on all of AOL. Then, in 1996, their website was launched. Originally, it was named ChristianityOnline.com before becoming ChristianityToday.com. Today ChristianityToday.com serves as the web home for Christianity Today magazine, which now has distinct sections for Local Church Pastors, Reporting,\n Women, History, and Spanish readers.\nTogether, all Christianity Today brands reach more than 2.5 million people every month when print and digital views are combined, plus more than 5 million pageviews per month on the Internet. The ministry offers access, both premium and free, to more than 100,000 articles and other content on their various websites. They operate several stand-alone websites from ChristianityToday including SmallGroups.com, Preaching Today, Church Law & Tax and many other sites.\n\nDefunct\nIn 2005, Christianity Today International published 12 magazines, but following the financial downturn of 2008 it was forced to shutter several publications. By 2017 that had further diminished to three, as many of them became sections of Christianity Today proper.\n\nLeadership Journal (1980\u20132016)\nThe first \"sister publication\" added to the Christianity Today publishing group was Leadership: A Practical Journal for Church Leaders, launched in 1980. The subtitle clearly defined the journal's mission: it was a quarterly publication, aimed primarily at clergy and focusing on the practical concerns of ministry and church leadership. The first issue of Leadership sold out its initial press run of 50,000 copies and the publication was in the black after a single issue. The journal continued in print for 36 years. After volume 37, issue 1 (winter 2016), Christianity Today discontinued the print publication, replacing it with expanded content in Christianity Today for pastors and church leaders and occasional print supplements, as well as a new website, CTPastors.com.\n\nCampus Life\/Ignite Your Faith (1982\u20132009)\nIn 1982, Christianity Today purchased the magazine Campus Life, aimed at a high school audience, from, Campus Life Publications, Inc., a nonprofit organization, which had purchased Campus Life magazine from Youth For Christ in 1980.

It ceased publication in 2009.\n\nPartnership\/Marriage Partnership (1984\u20132009)\nPartnership was launched in 1984 as a magazine for wives of clergy.

In 2012 the name of the digital publication was changed back to Today's Christian Woman, and in 2016 it stopped being issued as a regularly scheduled digital periodical.\n\nChristian History (1989\u20132008)\nChristian History was a journal of the history of Christianity, first issued in January 1982 by the Christian History Institute. Each issue had multiple articles covering a single theme. Initially published annually, it became a quarterly publication. Christianity Today took over ownership of the magazine beginning with issue 22 in 1989. It was discontinued after the publication of issue 99 in 2008.

In the post-war period, this figure has been even higher, but the privatization of a large number of public corporations since the 1980s, including NTT, Japanese National Railways, and Japan Post, already reduced the number. \nThe vast majority of civil servants (2.74 million) are employed by local governments, while around 585,000 are national government civil servants. National civil servants are divided into \"special\" and \"regular\" service categories. Appointments in the special service category are governed by political or other factors and do not involve competitive examinations. This category includes cabinet ministers, heads of independent agencies, members of the Self-Defense Forces, Diet officials, and ambassadors. \nThe core of the national civil service is composed of members of the regular service, who are recruited through competitive examinations. This group is further divided into the General Service and the Comprehensive Service, the latter forming a civil service elite.\n\nComposition of civil service\nComposition\nAs of 2018, there are approximately 3.33 million civil servants in Japan. Among these, the vast majority of around 2.74 million are local civil servants (Japanese: \u5730\u65b9\u516c\u52d9\u54e1) working for local governments and agencies. Among the around 585,000 national civil servants (Japanese: \u56fd\u5bb6\u516c\u52d9\u54e1), roughly 298,000 are in Special Service (Japanese: \u7279\u5225\u8077) and 287,000 are in Regular Service (Japanese: \u4e00\u822c\u8077). \nSpecial Service includes: \n\nPoliticians, such as ministers, senior vice-ministers, ambassadors and National Diet members,\nJudges, court employees, and employees of the Diet,\nEmployees of the Ministry of Defense (approx. 268,000, consisting of the lion's share of Special Service employees), and\nOther employees with special duties, to whom certain civil service principles (e.g. recruitment by examination and guarantee of status) do not apply, such as Imperial Household Agency employees.\nRegular Service employees form the rest of the national civil service, including various ministries and Incorporated Administrative Agencies. After the privatization of Japan Post, the incorporation of certain Japanese universities, and other civil service reforms, the number of regular service employees decreased from over 800,000 to around 287,000 in 2019.\n\nRecruitment and examination\nCivil servants are generally recruited through competitive examinations. Civil servants are classified into three types: (1) Comprehensive Service, which engages in policy-making and research, (2) General Service, which engages mainly in \"routine work\", and (3) Specialists, such as tax inspectors, air traffic controllers, doctors and teachers, who are recruited by exams or other forms of assessment. \nThe Comprehensive Service recruits through several types of exams (known as Level I Examination), testing at levels of a university undergraduate or a graduate degree, with different exams based on the division of the Service. The General Service also recruits through exams, with an exam aimed at university graduates (Level II Examination) and an exam for high school graduates (Level III Examination). Successful candidates are interviewed, and final selection takes into account the result of interviews. \nHistorically, all senior officials were promoted from Comprehensive Service recruits, although there are recent efforts to offer General Service employees opportunities of promotion as well. In the Japanese Cabinet Secretariat, for example, among the 4,715 employees in management positions, 73.1% were recruited by Level I examination, while 21.8% were recruited by Level II and III examinations. Among kach\u014d level (Japanese: \u8ab2\u9577\u7d1a) positions, 87.2% were recruited by Level I examination.\n\nElite bureaucracy\nAccording to a Library of Congress report published in 1992, many Japan analysts have pointed to the elite bureaucracy as the people who really govern Japan, although they composed only a tiny fraction of the country's more than 1 million national government employees. The elite civil servants' power was especially strong in the years of rapid economic growth, before the 1990s.\nSeveral hundred of the elite are employed at each national ministry or agency. Although entry into the elite through open examinations does not require a college degree, the majority of its members are alumni of Japan's most prestigious universities. The University of Tokyo law faculty is the single most important source of elite bureaucrats. After graduation from college and, increasingly, some graduate-level study, applicants take a series of difficult higher civil service examinations: in 2009, for example, 22,186 took the tests of higher (the 1st grade) civil service, but only 1,494, or 6.7 percent, were successful. Of those who were successful, only 660 were actually hired.\nLike the scholar-officials of imperial China, successful candidates were hardy survivors of a grueling education and testing process that necessarily began in early childhood and demanded total concentration. The typical young bureaucrat, who is in most cases male, is an intelligent, hardworking, and dedicated individual. But some bureaucrats, critics argue, lack imagination and compassion for people whose way of life is different from their own.\nThe public's attitude toward the elite is ambivalent. The elite enjoy great social prestige, but its members are also resented. They live in a realm that is at least partly public, yet far removed from the lives of ordinary people. Compared with politicians, they are generally viewed as honest. Involvement of top officials in scandals such as the Recruit affair, however, had to some extent tarnished their image.\nJapan's elite bureaucrats are insulated from direct political pressure because there are very few political appointments in the civil service. Cabinet ministers are usually career politicians, but they are moved in and out of their posts quite frequently (with an average tenure of under a year), and usually have little opportunity to develop a power base within a ministry, or force their civil service subordinates to adopt reforms. Below the cabinet minister is the administrative vice minister (Japanese: \u4e8b\u52d9\u6b21\u5b98 ja:\u4e8b\u52d9\u6b21\u5b98). Administrative vice ministers and their subordinates are career civil servants whose appointments are determined in accordance with an internally established principle of seniority.\n\nReform of the elite civil service since the 1990s\nThe autonomy and power of the bureaucracy has been substantially reduced since the 1990s. In the 1990s, electoral reforms gave politicians stronger links to their constituencies, strengthening their position. In the 2000s, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi reduced the power of \u201ctribal politicians\u201d who spoke for special interests such as farmers, and brought in policy advisers to circumvent the civil service. Successive reforms also restricted the practice of amakudari (Japanese: \u5929\u4e0b\u308a), the \u201cdescent from heaven\u201d, where retiring bureaucrats were sent to lucrative jobs at the public body they used to oversee. Because of these reforms, since the late 1990s, many top-class candidates in Japanese universities prefer to choose to join investment banks rather than the civil service.\nFinally, in 2014, Prime Minister Abe Shinzo again reduced bureaucratic autonomy by centralizing the appointment of all senior civil servants in the Cabinet Office. Civil servants must now impress the prime minister's lieutenants to reach to the top, instead of their civil service colleagues.\nCertain commentators have linked the reduction of the civil service's autonomy to recent scandals, including allegations of sexual harassment, falsified documents, obvious lies to parliament and misplaced military records.\n\nWomen in the civil service\nIn 2020, the Japanese government reported that 36.8% new civil servants hired in fiscal year 2020 were women, a new high. Of 8,461 civil servants hired in the career-track, general, and specialized positions, 3,117 were women. In the percentage of women hired is 1.4% higher than in 2019. By type of positions, 35.4% of new hires in career-track positions were women, compared to 39.1% in general positions, and 33.8% in specialist work. \nAs late as 2014, the percentage of women in new hires was 20\u201325%, before a jump to 30% in 2015 and further increases since 2017. The increase in 2015 was accredited to the Cabinet's Fourth Basic Plan for Gender Equality, which set a goal of 30% for new hires in the civil service. From 1990 to 2003, around 10% to 15% of new civil service recruits each year were women.\n\nHistory\nJapan before World War II\nThe Japanese had been exposed to bureaucratic institutions at least by the early seventh century A.D. (Nara period), when the imperial court adopted the laws and government structure of Tang China. However, the distinctive Chinese (Confucian) institution of civil service examinations never took root, and the imported system was never successfully imposed on the country at large. But by the middle of the Tokugawa period (1600-1867), the samurai class functions had evolved from military to clerical and administrative functions. Following the Meiji Restoration (1868), the new elite, which came from the lower ranks of the samurai, established a Western-style civil service.\n\nOccupied Japan\nAlthough the United States occupation dismantled both the military and zaibatsu establishments, it did little, outside of abolishing the prewar Home Ministry, to challenge the power of the bureaucracy. There was considerable continuity \u2014in institutions, operating style, and personnel \u2014 between the civil service before and after the occupation, partly because General Douglas MacArthur's staff ruled indirectly and depended largely on the cooperation of civil servants. A process of mutual co-optation occurred. Also, United States policy planners never regarded the civil service with the same opprobrium as the military or economic elites. The civil service's role in Japan's militarism was generally downplayed. Many of the occupation figures themselves were products of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal and had strong faith in the merits of civil service professionalism. Finally, the perceived threat of the Soviet Union in the late 1940s created a community of interests for the occupiers and for conservative, social order-conscious administrators.\n\n1970s and 1980s\nIn a 1975 article, political scientist Chalmers Johnson quotes a retired vice minister of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) who said that the Diet was merely \"an extension of the bureaucracy\". The official claimed that \"the bureaucracy drafts all the laws.... All the legislature does is to use its powers of investigation, which for about half the year keeps most of the senior officials cooped up in the Diet.\"\nIn the years since this official made his proud boast, however, it became apparent that there were limits to the bureaucrats' power. The most important was the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan's growing role in policy formation. Political scientist B.C. Koh suggested that in many cases members of the LDP policy-oriented tribes (zoku) had greater expertise in their fields than elite bureaucrats. Before the latter drafted legislation, they had to consult and follow the initiatives of the party's Policy Research Council. Many analysts consider the role of the bureaucracy in drafting legislation to be no greater than that of its counterparts in France, Germany, and other countries. Also, the decision of many retired bureaucrats to run as LDP candidates for the Diet might not reflect, as had been previously assumed, the power of the officials but rather the impatience of ambitious men who wanted to locate themselves, politically, \"where the action is.\"\nAn intense rivalry among the ministries came into play whenever major policy decisions were formulated. Elite civil servants were recruited by and spent their entire careers in a single ministry. As a result, they developed a strong sectional solidarity and zealously defended their turf. Non-bureaucratic actors\u2014the politicians and interest groups\u2014could use this rivalry to their own advantage.\n\n1990s and beyond\n1990s\nThe Ministry of Finance is generally considered the most powerful and prestigious of the ministries. Its top officials are regarded as the cream of the elite. Although it was relatively unsuccessful in the 1970s when the deficit rose, the ministry was very successful in the 1980s in constraining government spending and raising taxes, including a twelve-year battle to get a consumption tax passed. The huge national debt in the early 1990s, however, may be evidence that this budget-minded body had been unsuccessful in the previous decade in curbing demands for popular policies such as health insurance, rice price supports, and the unprofitable nationwide network of the privatized Japan Railways Group. Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) frequently encountered obstacles in its early post-occupation plans to reconsolidate the economy. It has not always been successful in imposing its will on private interests, politicians, or other ministries. According to law professor John Owen Haley, writing in the late 1980s, MITI's practice of gy\u014dsei shid\u014d, or administrative guidance, often described as evidence of the bureaucracy's hidden power, was in fact a second-best alternative to \"express statutory authority that would have legitimated its exercise of authority.\" Administrative reform policies in the 1980s imposed ceilings on civil service staff and spending that probably contributed to a deterioration of morale and working conditions.\nStill another factor limiting bureaucratic power was the emergence of an affluent society. In the early postwar period, the scarcity of capital made it possible for the Ministry of Finance and MITI to exert considerable influence over the economy through control of the banking system (see Monetary and fiscal policy). To a decreasing extent, this scarcity remained until the 1980s because most major companies had high debt-equity ratios and depended on the banks for infusions of capital. Their huge profits and increasing reliance on securities markets in the late 1980s, however, meant that the Ministry of Finance had less influence. The wealth, technical sophistication, and new confidence of the companies also made it difficult for MITI to exercise administrative guidance. The ministry could not restrain aggressive and often politically controversial purchases by Japanese corporate investors in the United States, such as Mitsubishi Estate's October 1989 purchase of Rockefeller Center in New York City, which, along with the Sony Corporation's acquisition of Columbia Pictures several weeks earlier, heated up trade friction between the two countries.\nThe whole issue of trade friction and foreign pressure tended to politicize the bureaucracy and promote unprecedented divisiveness in the late 1980s and early 1990s. During the Structural Impediments Initiative talks held by Japan and the United States in early 1990, basic changes in Japan's economy were discussed: reforms of the distribution and pricing systems, improvement of the infrastructure, and elimination of official procedures that limited foreign participation in the economy. Although foreign pressure of this sort is resented by many Japanese as an intrusion on national sovereignty, it also provides an opportunity for certain ministries to make gains at the expense of others. There is hardly a bureaucratic jurisdiction in the economic sphere that is not in some sense affected.\nInternationally minded political and bureaucratic elites have found their market-opening reforms, designed to placate United States demands, repeatedly sabotaged by other interests, especially agriculture. Such reactions intensified United States pressure, which in turn created a sense of crisis and a siege mentality within Japan. The \"internationalization\" of Japan's society in other ways also divided the bureaucratic elite. MITI, the Ministry of Labor, and the Ministry of Justice had divergent views on how to respond to the influx of unskilled, usually South Asian and Southeast Asian, laborers into the labor-starved Japanese economy. An estimated 300,000 to 400,000 of them worked illegally for small Japanese firms in the late 1980s. Ministry of Education, Science, and Culture revision of guidelines on the writing of history textbooks, ostensibly a domestic matter, aroused the indignation of Japan's Asian neighbors because the changes tended to soften accounts of wartime atrocities (see Japanese history textbook controversies).\n\n2000s and 2010s\nCivil services in Japan underwent significant changes and reforms to work more efficiently in severe budget situation of the government. In 2001, Central Government Reform was implemented to merge existing ministries, strengthen the operation of cabinet and achieve more efficient work.  Criticism to civil services from media and the public has got stronger against some scandals, such as the practice of amakudari to assure the advantages of high-rank officials after retirement, salary standard and many other factors.\nIn 2007, Junichiro Koizumi passed the postal privatisation bills (see ja:\u8056\u57df\u306a\u304d\u69cb\u9020\u6539\u9769). The major concern was Japan Post, with government backing, stymieing competition and giving politicians access to postal savings to fund pet projects. Japan post was split into three companies in 2007, intending to be privatized by 2017. Koizumi also reformed Independent Administrative Institution staff as privatized officers, which reduced half of the civil service. Japan post employed 280,000 people, or one-third of civil servants. However, as of 2020, the government still holds 57% of shares, and March 2028 was announced as the target date of privatization.\nIn the 2009 general election, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) came to power after many years of Liberal Democratic Party of Japan (LDP) government. DPJ set up the policy of \u201cleadership by politics\u201d, criticized the initiative of bureaucracy in the era of LDP, and planned to reform civil service. However, the DPJ was defeated in the 2012 general election, and the LDP regained power.\nIn 2014, Prime Minister Abe Shinzo again reduced bureaucratic autonomy by centralizing the appointment of all senior civil servants in the Cabinet Office.\n\nSee also\nLaw of Japan\nGovernment of Japan\n\nReferences\n This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain.

(or simply Criterion) is an American home-video distribution company that focuses on licensing, restoring and distributing \"important classic and contemporary films\". A de facto subsidiary of arthouse film distributor Janus Films, Criterion serves film and media scholars, cinephiles and public and academic libraries. Criterion has helped to standardize certain aspects of home-video releases such as film restoration, the letterboxing format for widescreen films and the inclusion of bonus features such as scholarly essays and documentary content about the films and filmmakers. Criterion most notably pioneered the use of commentary tracks. Criterion has produced and distributed more than 1,000 special editions of its films in VHS, Betamax, LaserDisc, DVD, Blu-ray and Ultra HD Blu-ray formats and box sets. These films and their special features are also available via The Criterion Channel, an online streaming service that the company operates.\nThe Criterion Collection is considered a leading boutique Blu-ray label.\n\nHistory\nThe company was founded in 1984 by Robert Stein, Aleen Stein and Joe Medjuck, who later were joined by Roger Smith. In 1985, the Steins, William Becker and Jonathan B. Turell founded the Voyager Company to publish educational multimedia CD-ROMs (1989\u20132000), and the Criterion Collection became a subordinate division of the Voyager Company, with Janus Films holding a minority stake in the company, and decided to expand its product on videocassettes and videodiscs. In March 1994, Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck GmbH bought 20% of Voyager for US$6.7 million; the four founders each retained a 20% owner's share.\nIn 1997, the Voyager Company was dissolved (Aleen Stein founded the Organa LLC CD-ROM publishing company), and Holtzbrinck Publishers sold the Voyager brand name, 42 CD-ROM titles, the Voyager web site and associated assets to Learn Technologies Interactive, LLC (LTI). Stein sold 42 Voyager titles to LTI from his Voyager\/Criterion company share. The remaining three partners, Aleen Stein, Becker and Turell owned the Criterion Collection company, which has a business partnership with Janus Films and had one with Home Vision Entertainment (HVE) until 2005, when Image Entertainment bought HVE. On November 4, 2013, it was announced that Sony Pictures Home Entertainment would handle distribution. In May 2024, Janus Films and Criterion were acquired by Steven Rales.\n\nHome Vision Entertainment\nIn 1986, Charles Benton founded Home Vision Entertainment (HVE), the home-video division of Public Media Inc. (PMI), which he had previously founded in 1968. The HVE company sold, advertised, marketed and distributed Criterion Collection DVDs, and also sold its own HVE brand of DVDs (co-produced with Criterion), including The Merchant Ivory Collection and the Classic Collection, a joint venture between Home Vision Entertainment and Janus Films. The latter enterprise published HVE imprint films, for which Janus Films owned the video rights, but which were unavailable from the Criterion Collection; however, Criterion published the Classic Collection films. In 2005, Image Entertainment bought HVE making it the exclusive distributor of Criterion Collection products until 2013.\n\nOnline ventures and marketing\nThe Criterion Collection began to provide video-on-demand (VOD) in partnership with Mubi (formerly The Auteurs) in 2008. In February 2011, Criterion began switching its VOD offerings exclusively to Hulu Plus. In November 2016, FilmStruck, a film streaming service from Turner Classic Movies, succeeded Hulu as the exclusive streaming service for the Criterion Collection. Some Criterion films were streamed by Kanopy. On October 26, 2018, Warner Bros. Digital Networks and Turner announced that FilmStruck would shut down on November 29. Criterion stated in a blog post that it was \"trying to find ways we can bring our library and original content back to the digital space as soon as possible\".\nOn November 16, 2018, Criterion announced the launch of the Criterion Channel as a standalone service, wholly owned and operated by the Criterion Collection, in the United States and Canada. Some of the VOD service's offerings are also available on the Max streaming platform.\nBritish film magazine Sight & Sound revealed in its April 2016 issue that Criterion would be expanding its releases to the United Kingdom. The first six titles were released on April 18, 2016.\n\nContributions and influence\nThe Criterion Collection video company pioneered the correct aspect-ratio letterboxing presentation of films, as well as commentary soundtracks, multi-disc sets, special editions and definitive versions. These ideas and the special features introduced by the Criterion Collection have been highly influential, and have become industry-wide standards for premium home video releases.\n\nLetterboxing\nWith its eighth LaserDisc release, Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956), Criterion introduced the letterbox format, which added black bars to the top and bottom of the 4:3 standard television set in order to preserve the original aspect ratio of the film. Thereafter, Criterion made letterboxing the standard presentation for all its releases of films shot in widescreen aspect ratios.\n\nCommentary soundtracks\nThe Criterion Collection's second LaserDisc title, King Kong (1933), was the debut of the scene-specific audio commentary contained in a separate analog channel of the LaserDisc, in which American film historian Ronald Haver spoke about the production, cast, screenplay, production design and special effects. He also provides commentary on the LaserDisc editions of Casablanca (1942), Here Comes Mr. Jordan (1941), Singin' in the Rain (1952) and The Wizard of Oz (1939). Typically, the chapter-indexed commentaries are exclusive to the Criterion releases and their initial DVD reissues; they became collectors' items when the original studios reissued titles previously licensed to Criterion, regardless of whether new commentary tracks were produced.\n\nSpecial editions\nThe Criterion Collection began in 1984 with the releases of Citizen Kane (1941) and King Kong (1933) on LaserDisc, the latter's source negatives courtesy of the Library of Congress. The company later became known for pioneering the \"special edition\" DVD concept containing bonus materials such as trailers, commentaries, documentaries, alternate endings and deleted scenes. The success of these releases established the special-edition version in the DVD business. In 2006, taking advantage of advanced film-transfer and film-restoration technologies, Criterion published higher-quality versions, with bonus materials, of early catalog titles such as Amarcord (1973), Brazil (1985) and Seven Samurai (1954).\n\nFilm restoration\nOriginally, Criterion released art, genre and mainstream movies on LaserDisc such as Halloween (1978), Ghostbusters (1984), Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992), Armageddon (1998) and The Rock (1996). Increasingly, the Criterion Collection has also focused on releasing world cinema, mainstream cinema classics and critically successful obscure films. Using the best available source materials, the company produced technologically improved and cleaner versions, such as those for The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928), M (1931),  Children of Paradise (1945), The Third Man (1949), Seven Samurai (1954) and Amarcord (1973). Almost every title contains film-cleaning and film-restoration essays in the booklets, while some even have featurettes comparing the restored and unrestored images.\n\nLicenses\nSome previously licensed Criterion Collection titles, such as The Harder They Come (1972), are now commercially unavailable as new product, and are only available in resale (used) form. Titles such as RoboCop (1987), Hard Boiled (1992), The Killer (1989) and Ran (1985) became unavailable when their publishing licenses expired or when Criterion published improved versions, such as those for Beauty and the Beast (1946), M (1931), The Wages of Fear (1953) and Seven Samurai (1954). As of October 2023, over 200 of the 384 titles from the List of Criterion Collection Laserdisc releases have been re-released.\nAnother example is the film Charade (1963), which had become a public-domain property for lacking the legally-required copyright notice. Criterion produced a restored edition under license from Universal Pictures for the initial edition and for the later anamorphic widescreen re-release edition of the film.\nPeriodically, Criterion releases material on DVD and Blu-ray disc licensed from the studios with whom the company had previously dealt (such as Universal's and Terry Gilliam's 1985 film Brazil); these new releases are generally undertaken on a case-by-case basis.\nCriterion released its first Walt Disney Pictures title, Andrew Stanton's WALL-E, in 2022. This was not the result of an ongoing deal between Disney and Criterion, but rather licensed as a one-off, with Stanton approaching Criterion and \"wanting to be part of the club\".\n\nFormats\nAll Criterion titles are numbered, which is shown on the bottom of the spine of the packaging. Though the bulk of Criterion's catalog is of live-action films, they have also released animated films (Akira, Fantastic Planet, Fantastic Mr. Fox and WALL-E), television series (Tanner '88, Fishing with John and select episodes of I Love Lucy and The Addams Family) and music videos (Beastie Boys Video Anthology).\n\nLaserDisc and VHS\/Betamax\nThe Criterion Collection began publishing LaserDiscs on December 1, 1984, with its release of Citizen Kane, until March 16, 1999, with Michael Bay's Armageddon (#384). Three of the company's early titles (The 39 Steps, The Lady Vanishes and The Third Man) were also issued on VHS and Betamax. These were Criterion's only releases on those formats\u2014other Janus\/Criterion titles were often released to VHS through Home Vision Entertainment.\n\nDVD and Blu-ray\nCriterion entered the DVD market in 1998 with a reset numbering system, beginning with Seven Samurai, spine #2 (Grand Illusion, #1, was delayed for a year while restoration was underway on a then-newly-found camera negative.) As with its laserdiscs, Criterion's early DVD editions of widescreen films were presented in the letterbox format, but Criterion did not anamorphically enhance its discs for 16:9 monitors until mid-1999 with its release of Insomnia (#47).\nCriterion was slow to expand into high-definition releases, partly because of the HD format wars between Blu-ray and HD DVD. Once Blu-ray had emerged as the industry-standard high-definition home-video format, Criterion began to release Blu-ray editions of select films from its collection, beginning with the Blu-ray release of Wong Kar-wai's Chungking Express (#453; currently out of print) on December 16, 2008. In late 2013, Criterion announced that with the November release of the Zatoichi boxset (spine #679), all future releases would be in dual format (DVD and Blu-ray packaged together) rather than as individual releases. This decision also applied to most upgrade re-releases introduced after November 2013. After customer feedback revealed some reluctance to this approach, All That Jazz (#724) became the last chronological spine number released as a dual-format edition, and the decision was reversed to release separate discs for titles beginning in September 2014.\nDespite the emergence of Blu-ray as the industry-standard high-definition format, Janus\/Criterion continues to support the DVD format. Not only are all their new Blu-ray releases accompanied by a standard-definition DVD version, but revised and upgraded releases are also released on both formats (barring the brief foray into dual-format releases). Moreover, the company's standalone line of Eclipse releases are currently only made available in the standard DVD format.\nAside from the core catalog, the company has also released films through its Essential Art House, Eclipse, Merchant Ivory and Janus Contemporaries lines, as well as a few releases outside of any product line. Many of these releases have also been collected and sold in various box sets.\n\nIn early 2016 for the first time in its history, Criterion announced it would begin releasing its catalogue outside of the US and Canada (earlier international Criterion titles such as the Japanese LaserDisc of Blade Runner were licensed to other companies). In partnership with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, releases began to be distributed with the launch of six titles in the U.K. during the month.\nCriterion's DVD releases are a mixture of NTSC-standard Region 0 (region-free) and Region 1 DVDs. Blu-ray discs are Region A-locked in North America or Region B-locked in the United Kingdom (though there are exceptions). However, when SPHE stopped distributing Criterion's releases in the UK, the distribution moved to Spirit Entertainment.\n\nUltra HD Blu-ray\nOn August 11, 2021, Criterion announced that it would begin publishing titles in Ultra HD Blu-ray format in November 2021. All Criterion Ultra HD Blu-ray releases will include both an Ultra HD Blu-ray copy and a regular Blu-ray copy of a film (with all the special features on the regular Blu-ray), with select releases including Dolby Vision HDR and Dolby Atmos. The first such releases were announced on August 16 for a November 21 release: Citizen Kane (#1104, returning to the collection for the first time since 1992), Mulholland Drive and Menace II Society. The company also released The Red Shoes, A Hard Day's Night and The Piano on Ultra HD Blu-ray disc. The film Uncut Gems (#1101), which was previously planned for Blu-ray and DVD release in October 2021, was delayed until November in order to also give the film an Ultra HD Blu-ray release.\n\nStreaming as The Criterion Channel\nAfter forays in providing titles from the Collection as streaming video-on-demand (VOD) in partnership with other companies \u2013 Mubi (formerly The Auteurs, 2008), Hulu Plus (2011\u20132016) and TCM's FilmStruck (2016\u20132018) \u2013 Criterion titles found themselves without an online home when FilmStruck announced it would be shutting down on November 29, 2018. The company stated in a blog post that it was \"trying to find ways we can bring our library and original content back to the digital space as soon as possible\".\nA month later, Criterion announced their own standalone subscription service, The Criterion Channel available to subscribers in the United States and Canada. The service began on April 8, 2019. The Channel's offerings include rotating playlists, temporarily licensed films (and some television offerings) from a variety of studios and rights holders alongside streaming editions of Criterion Collection releases replete with special features.

As a result of his influence, Kurosawa's work, as well as his personal character, have been subject to a number of negative criticisms. These criticisms are points of heated debate among those who study Kurosawa's work, and scores of pieces have been written both advocating for these criticisms and defending against them.\nThe majority of these criticisms fall into one or more of the following categories: a) accusations, by European commentators, of insufficient \"Japaneseness,\" particularly compared to the work of the older director, Kenji Mizoguchi; b) accusations of sentimentality or didacticism; c) criticisms of the (alleged) political stances taken by Kurosawa in his films; d) objections to his films' treatment of women; e) accusations of elitism; f) accusations of pandering directly to the tastes of Western audiences; g) criticisms of his alleged lack of contact (after 1965) with contemporary realities; and h) claims of personal arrogance and mistreatment of colleagues.\n\nMizoguchi versus Kurosawa dispute\nIn the early to mid-1950s, while Kurosawa's films were being widely viewed in Europe and North America, the final films of a Japanese film master of the older generation, Kenji Mizoguchi, also began to be shown internationally and receive film festival prizes. This simultaneous exposure led to frequent critical comparisons between the two directors. A number of critics belonging to the French New Wave, such as Jean-Luc Godard, championed Mizoguchi's films at the expense of Kurosawa's work:\n\nSince Japanese films appeared on our screens after the war, an aesthetic dispute has ranged the admirers of Kurosawa (Rashomon, The Seven Samurai, The Idiot) against those of Mizoguchi. A dispute made even more furious by the fact that both directors have been frequent prizewinners at festivals. Our thanks are due to Jean-Jos\u00e9 Richer for having cut authoritatively across the debate: \"This double distinction awarded in strict equality (to The Seven Samurai and Sansho Dayu [Sansho the Bailiff], Venice [Film Festival] 1954) is unwarranted\u2026 There can be no doubt that any comparison between Mizoguchi and Kurosawa turns irrefutably to the advantage of the former. Alone among the Japanese film-makers known to us, he goes beyond the seductive but minor stage of exoticism to a deeper level where one need no longer worry about false prestige\" (Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma 40).\nIn the same article, Godard refers to Kurosawa as \"merely a more elegant Ralph Habib\", referring to a very obscure contemporary French director who (apparently) specialized in adventure films.\nGodard's fellow New Wave critic-filmmaker, Jacques Rivette, writes: \"You can compare only what is comparable and that which aims high enough. Mizoguchi, alone, imposes a feeling of a unique world and language, is answerable only to himself... He seems to be the only Japanese director who is completely Japanese and yet is also the only one that achieves a true universality, that of an individual.\"\nAccording to these French commentators, Mizoguchi seemed, of the two artists, the more authentically Japanese. But at least one film scholar has questioned the validity of this dichotomy between \"Japanese\" Mizoguchi and \"Western\" Kurosawa: \"There were even suggestions by the influential [French film critic] Andr\u00e9 Bazin that Mizoguchi represented a more authentic Japaneseness, while Kurosawa was quite obviously influenced by the west, as was Mizoguchi [emphasis added].\"\nKurosawa himself deeply admired the older master, particularly his indefatigable perfectionism. In his eulogy at Mizoguchi's funeral, Kurosawa said, \"Mizoguchi's greatness was that he would do anything to heighten the reality of every scene. He never made compromises\u2026 Of all Japanese directors, I have the greatest respect for him... With the death of Mizoguchi, Japanese film has lost its truest creator.\"\n\nAccusations of sentimentality, na\u00efvet\u00e9 and\/or didacticism\nA criticism frequently directed at Kurosawa's films is that the director's preoccupation with ethical and moral themes led him at times to create what some commentators regard as sentimental or na\u00efve work. Speaking of the postwar \"slice of life\" drama One Wonderful Sunday, for example, film scholar (and future politician) Audie Bock claimed that not even Kurosawa's celebrated prowess as an editor could save one particular scene from bathos: \"The last sequence\u2026 is an excruciating twelve minutes of the boy conducting an imaginary orchestra in an empty amphitheater while his girlfriend appeals directly to the camera for the viewer to join in. Angles and focal lengths change, details of leaves scattering in the wind are intercut, but nothing makes the scene go any faster.\"\nAbout the Christmas scene in Scandal, when several of the characters go to a tavern and sing Auld Lang Syne (in Japanese) together, Donald Richie writes, \"\u2026 soon all the whores are crying, the band is crying, the drunks are crying, all roaring out the lyrics. The horror of the situation (for this is plainly the genesis of the harrowing night-town sequence of Ikiru) does not occur to the director. Rather, these are good and simple people and this is their moment of truth.\"\nOn Dersu Uzala\u2014a Soviet-Japanese production about an early 20th-century Nanai hunter in the Siberian wilderness\u2014scholar Joan Mellen expresses the minority view when she writes: \"Kurosawa finds an ideology\u2026 in a pantheistic belief in the magnificence of nature and in an embarrassingly archaic, Rousseauesque adulation of the 'natural man'\u2026 But the contrast between the person [Dersu] at one with his surroundings and the world of industrialization, which Kurosawa depicts only in the abstract, is largely theoretical, rendering the work a sentimental journey.\"\nSome commentators claim that Kurosawa can at times be excessively didactic about the ethical points he makes in his films. Donald Richie, speaking of the upright hero of Red Beard (a film he otherwise praises highly), writes: \"These [wise moral] precepts are known to Dr. Niide before the film opens; they are not revealed to him in the course of the action. As a result Red Beard contains a didactic quality absent from Kurosawa's finest works, films like Ikiru, which also treat social themes.\"\nScholar Mitsuhiro Yoshimoto, writing of Ran, claims, \"as is often the case in Kurosawa films, some of the remarks by the principal characters\u2026 sound na\u00efve, didactic or overstated (e.g., Tango's reproval of Kyoami at the film's close: 'Do not blaspheme! It is the gods who weep. They see us killing each other over and over since time began. They can't save us from ourselves.')\" On the other hand, Yoshimoto also claims that Kurosawa may have created the cynical character of the master swordsman Sanjur\u014d in Yojimbo as a reaction to this very perception of na\u00efve moralism in the director's earlier work. As Kurosawa depicts him (this scholar claims), Sanjur\u014d, who hires out his services to both corrupt sides in a town feud, does not kill these grotesque characters out of any sense of moral justice, as previous Kurosawa heroes might have done, but merely for the fun of it.\n\nPolitical controversies\nDuring the Second World War, workers on all levels of the Japanese film industry were under immense pressure to create works that not only omitted the slightest criticism of the ruling military dictatorship, but that actively promoted kokusaku (\"national policy\"), that is, militarism and other aspects of fascist ideology. It was in this highly politicized atmosphere that Kurosawa began his career as a director in 1943. Therefore, some controversy exists about the extent to which his films of this period could be considered fascist propaganda.\nThe cultural historian Peter B. High sees Kurosawa's wartime cinema as part of the propagandistic trends of Japan at war and as an example of many of these conventions. About his second film, The Most Beautiful, which High refers to as a \"dark and gloomy rendition of the standard formulas of the [home front] genre\", he writes: \"The film announces its [patriotic] spiritist message in the very first scene. Over a loudspeaker, the factory manager (Shimura Takashi) is giving his morning pep talk to the factory personnel: 'Only an indomitable spirit of deep responsibility can achieve outstanding production results. There can be no improvement in production without an improvement in personal character!' The montage cuts back and forth between Shimura and the workers lined up in military fashion. One of the lines is made up of extremely young boys \u2013 a depressing sight.\" High also points out that Kurosawa during this period demonstrated \"a talent and enthusiasm for national policy scenarios\" by writing the blatantly propagandistic 1942 film Winged Victory (also known as A Triumph of Wings or Victory Song of Wings) for director Satsuo Yamamoto and submitting several other scripts that won prizes in \"people's cinema script\" contests given by the wartime Information Bureau.\nA few of the films Kurosawa directed after the war have also proved politically controversial. In her negative essay about the (mostly) Soviet-financed Dersu Uzala, Joan Mellen strongly criticizes Kurosawa's apparent acquiescence in what she perceives as \"evident Soviet anti-Chinese propaganda.\" (The film was made during the middle 1970s, when relations between the two Communist nations were very tense, particularly regarding the Ussuri region, where the film is set.) For example, in one sequence, Dersu, his friend Arseniev and Arseniev's men find traps that have been laid in the forest for wild animals, in which the animals starve and die, to be later sold for their skins. According to Dersu, this act has been perpetrated by \"bad Chinese.\" These \"bad Chinese\" also steal the wives of local indigenous men and leave the men to die; in the course of the film, Arseniev finds several such victims and rescues them from certain death.\nThe narrative of one of Kurosawa's last films, Rhapsody in August, centers on an elderly survivor of the atomic attack on Nagasaki who is visited by her half-Japanese, half-American nephew, Clark (Richard Gere), who appears to apologize, as an American, for the city's wartime destruction. Some viewers took Kurosawa to task for criticizing the U.S. while failing to condemn Japanese conduct during the war. Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote: \"A lot of people at Cannes were outraged that the film makes no mention of Pearl Harbor and Japan's atrocities in China\u2026 If Clark can apologize for bombing Nagasaki, why can't Granny apologize for the raid on Pearl Harbor?\" At a press conference during the Cannes Film Festival, Kurosawa, Canby reported, denied that he was trying to absolve the wartime Japanese government of responsibility: \"'We Japanese,' [Kurosawa] said, 'were also the victims of Japanese militarism.' The subject of the film, he insisted, is not guilt and responsibility but the horrors of war, in particular of the bomb, which has made possible the absolute end of everything.\"\n\nObjections to depictions of women\nA number of critics have reacted negatively to the female characters in Kurosawa's movies. (Kurosawa himself once noted: \"Of course, all my women [in my films] are rather strange, I agree.\") Joan Mellen, in her examination of this subject, praises only the director's characterization of Yukie (Setsuko Hara), the heroine of No Regrets for Our Youth, remarking that \"her face expresses the very potential of the Japanese woman that has been so often, during all these long centuries, left wasted and latent.\" Of the main female character in Rashomon, Masago, Mellen claims that \"in none of the versions [of the film's self-contradictory narrative] is the woman (Machiko Kyo) granted self-respect, dignity or spiritual value,\" and argues that Masago represents one aspect of a \"whore-madonna\" dichotomy on the part of her creator.\nMellen also claims that, after Rashomon, Kurosawa stopped portraying women's potential in his works \"as if repelled by Masago, that half-demon of his own creation.\" She maintains that many of Kurosawa's later heroines fall into one of two categories: the destructive and the masochistic woman. Speaking of The Idiot, she wrote, \"the sensual woman is portrayed as the castrating bitch and the 'good' girl is devoid of any capacity for pleasure.\" In the Gorky adaptation, The Lower Depths, one heroine is \"manipulative and malicious,\" and the other is \"weak and unable to survive on her own.\" By the time of Red Beard (1965), \"women in Kurosawa have become not only unreal and incapable of kindness, but totally bereft of autonomy, whether physical, intellectual, or emotional\u2026 Women at their best may only imitate the truths men discover.\"\nMitsuhiro Yoshimoto has noted that Kurosawa's films often offer a paradoxical bond between good and evil male protagonists, in which the distinction between them becomes blurred. Outside this \"M\u00f6bius strip of male bonding,\" any woman \"functions as a catalyst of sentimentalism by neutralizing\" this duality. \"Without being able to produce any value by herself,\" Yoshimoto writes, \"the woman in Kurosawa's films is often the embodiment of passivity threatening the solipsism of the split male subject.\"\nKurosawa scholar Stephen Prince concurs with the above views, though less censoriously: \"Kurosawa's is a world of men, and his interests are not piqued by the sexuality or the psychology of men and women in relation to each other\u2026 Unlike a male-oriented director like Sam Peckinpah, Kurosawa is not hostile to women, but his general lack of interest in them should be regarded as a major limitation of his work.\"\n\nAccusations of elitism\nIn Japan, critics and other filmmakers, conscious of Kurosawa's samurai background, have sometimes accused his work of elitism, because of his focus on exceptional, heroic individuals and groups of men. In one scene in Yojimbo, the samurai anti-hero Sanjur\u014d, having reneged on his agreement to fight for one of two factions in a feuding town, retreats to a high watchtower to watch, with considerable amusement, the two sides battle it out. This scene greatly offended the filmmaker Masahiro Shinoda, who interpreted the samurai's climb into the watchtower as symbolic of the director's detached, above-it-all attitude towards the chaotic social conditions he was depicting in the film.\nIn her commentary on the deluxe DVD edition of Seven Samurai, Joan Mellen maintains that certain shots of the samurai characters Kambei and Kyuzo, which to her reveal Kurosawa \"privileging\" these samurai, \"support the argument voiced by several Japanese critics that Kurosawa was an elitist\":\n\nKurosawa was hardly a progressive director, they argued, since his peasants could not discover among their own ranks leaders who might rescue the village. Instead, justifying the inequitable class structure of their society and ours, the peasants must rely on the aristocracy, the upper class, and in particular samurai, to ensure their survival\u2026 Tadao Sato, in particular, objected to Kurosawa's view that only a handful of people are great... Worst of all, the farmers are too stupid. Kurosawa defended himself against this charge in his interview with me. 'I wanted to say that after everything the peasants were the stronger, closely clinging to the earth\u2026 It was the samurai who were weak because they were being blown by the winds of time.'\n\nAccusations of pandering to Western audiences\nBecause of Kurosawa's popularity with Western audiences from the early 1950s onward, he has not escaped the charge of deliberately catering to the tastes of Westerners to achieve or maintain that popularity. Joan Mellen, recording the violently negative reaction (in the 1970s) of the left-wing director Nagisa Oshima to Kurosawa and his work, states: \"That Kurosawa had brought Japanese film to a Western audience meant [to Oshima] that he must be pandering to Western values and politics.\"\nKurosawa always strongly denied pandering to Western tastes: \"He has never catered to a foreign audience\" writes Audie Bock, \"and has condemned those who do.\" However, he did concede in an interview that part of the reason he employed dynamic \"Western\" stylistic elements in his films was to attract the young Japanese audience of that time. Japanese youth (in the director's view) often preferred the exciting styles of American and European films and were ignorant of or indifferent to their native history and culture. \"In order for them to understand I have to translate, as it were\u2026 [In Seven Samurai] under Mifune's scenes, I had [composer Fumio] Hayasaka put in a mambo. If purely Japanese music had been used I don't think the young people would have felt what that character was like, how much he resembled them\u2026 Oh, I'm Japanese all right. I'm truly Japanese.\"\n\nAlleged lack of contact with contemporary realities\nSeveral critics maintain that sometime around the mid-1960s, Kurosawa appeared to lose touch with (or perhaps interest in) the contemporary sociopolitical realities of Japan. Writes Stephen Prince: \"The tide of popular activism [in 1960s Japan] is relevant to Red Beard and to the films that followed because of its glaring absence from their narratives and concerns, because of the adamant refusal by these films to believe that society could be made better\u2026 By contrast [with the Japanese New Wave filmmakers], with evidence readily at hand of democratic protest in modern Japan\u2026 Kurosawa chose in his work to retreat to the past and to mythical spaces. The resurgent pessimism of the late films is defiant indeed.\"\nAudie Bock, writing in 1978, claims that the humanist ideology that sustained the director during previous decades was no longer relevant: \"By the time Red Beard was released, in 1965, the postwar era of values like 'humanism,' 'culture' and 'democracy' was over. Those who still flock to see it today do so not because it says something about contemporary Japan, but because it is a kind of summary statement of Kurosawa's values and technical virtuosity\u2026 it is the alienation of contemporary society from humanistic values that accounts for [his later films'] feeling of didactic remoteness\u2026 The shantytown atmosphere of Dodeskaden is hard to find in contemporary wealthy Japan, and the man in unspoiled nature represented by Dersu [Uzala] is hard to find anywhere in the world.\"\n\nClaims of personal arrogance and harsh treatment of colleagues\nDuring his lifetime, Kurosawa was often criticized by his countrymen for perceived \"arrogant\" behavior. \"Particularly in Japan,\" writes Mitsuhiro Yoshimoto, \"it is not unusual to find what is supposed to be a review or criticism of his films lapsing into a critic's personal commentary, impressions, or attack on Kurosawa as a director or as a person.\" It was in Japan that the (initially) disparaging nickname \"Kurosawa Tenn\u014d\" \u2013 \"The Emperor Kurosawa\" \u2013 was coined. \"Like tenn\u014d,\" Yoshimoto claimed, \"Kurosawa is said to cloister himself in his own small world, which is completely cut off from the everyday reality of the majority of Japanese. The nickname tenn\u014d is used in this sense to create an image of Kurosawa as a director who abuses his power solely for the purpose of self-indulgence.\"\nOn the sets of his productions, Kurosawa acquired a reputation as a stern taskmaster and even, for some, a dictator. It is well documented that, during the shooting of Seven Samurai, he was particularly harsh to Yoshio Inaba, the actor who played Gorobei, Kambei's second-in-command, and Inaba subsequently appeared in only one other film for the director (Throne of Blood) in a minor role.\nHe could even sometimes be hard on seasoned, highly respected film professionals. During the filming of Yojimbo, he lost his temper with cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa, who has been called \"quite simply, Japan's preeminent cinematographer.\" But when one of Miyagawa's assistants asked him, \"Why don't you get angry when Kurosawa yells at you?\" Miyagawa answered, \"Look at Kurosawa. He devotes himself completely to his work. No other director works so hard to achieve the ideal shot he has envisioned in his mind. I have no right to say anything to someone like him.\"\n\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\nBock, Audie (1978). Japanese Film Directors.

Shot almost entirely outdoors in the Russian Far East wilderness, the film explores the theme of a native of the forests who is fully integrated into his environment, leading a style of life that will inevitably be destroyed by the advance of civilization. It is also about the growth of respect and deep friendship between two men of profoundly different backgrounds, and about the difficulty of coping with the loss of capability that comes with old age.\nThe film won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, the Golden Prize and the Prix FIPRESCI at the 9th Moscow International Film Festival, and other awards. It was also a box office hit, selling more than 21 million tickets in the Soviet Union and Europe in addition to grossing $1.2 million in the United States and Canada.\n\nPlot\nIn the early 1900s, Captain Arsenyev embarks on a topographic surveying expedition in the Shkotovo region of the Ussuri territory. During the journey, he encounters Dersu Uzala, a nomadic Goldi hunter, who impresses Arsenyev with his wilderness skills. Dersu agrees to become their guide, leading the expedition through the rugged frontier.\nDersu gains the respect of the group with his experience, instincts, keen observation, and compassion. He demonstrates his resourcefulness by repairing an abandoned hut and leaving essential provisions for future travelers. As the expedition progresses, Arsenyev and Dersu venture alone to explore Lake Khanka but get caught in a blizzard. Dersu saves Arsenyev's life by building a shelter and tending to him throughout the night.\nThe party faces numerous hardships, including fatigue and starvation, but Dersu's wisdom and skills help them survive. Eventually, they encounter a Nanai family who offers them food, warmth, and hospitality. When the expedition nears its end, Arsenyev invites Dersu to accompany him back to Khabarovsk. However, Dersu believes his place is in the forest and declines the offer, only asking for rifle cartridges.\nFive years later, Arsenyev embarks on another expedition, hoping to reunite with Dersu. Eventually, they meet again, and Dersu agrees to guide the party once more. During their journey, Arsenyev and Dersu face a dangerous situation when they become stranded on a raft heading towards treacherous rapids. Dersu sacrifices himself by pushing Arsenyev to safety before the raft is destroyed. Arsenyev and the rest of the group rescue Dersu, and their bond grows stronger.\nAs time passes, Dersu senses they are being stalked by a Siberian tiger, an amu. He tries to persuade the tiger to leave peacefully but is forced to shoot at it. Distraught over injuring the sacred animal, Dersu becomes troubled and realizes he can no longer provide for himself as a hunter. He appeals to Arsenyev to take him home, but Dersu struggles to adapt to city life, feeling confined and out of place. Dersu tells the family that he can no longer stay in town and must go back to the mountains.  Arsenyev, though sad, realizes that Dersu needs to go, so he buys him a new high powered rifle so Dersu will have a better chance to survive. \nEventually, news reaches Arsenyev that the body of an unidentified Goldi hunter has been found, and he is asked to identify it. Arsenyev recognizes the body as Dersu's and is devastated by the loss. The official in charge speculates that Dersu may have been killed for his rifle, the new one that Arsenyev bought for him. As Dersu is buried, Arsenyev plants his walking stick beside the grave as a symbol of remembrance.\n\nCast\nYury Solomin as Vladimir Arsenyev\nMaxim Munzuk as Dersu Uzala\nVladimir Kremena as Turtygin\nAlexander Pyatkov as Olenev\nSvetlana Danilchenko as Anna\nSuimenkul Chokmorov as Chzhan Bao\n\nProduction\nIn an interview conducted for the 1999 RUSCICO DVD release, co-star Solomin stated that Kurosawa had long known of Arsenyev's book and had planned to make a film version very early in his career in the late 1930s, but had dropped the project after realising that it had to be made in the taiga region where the events had actually taken place. The Soviet government allowed few foreigners there.  By the 1970s they allowed Kurosawa and his team, but monitored them closely during the year-long production.\nIn 1971, Kurosawa attempted suicide during a difficult period in his career, questioning his creative ability after the commercial failure of Dodes'ka-den the year before and the subsequent denial of funds for his productions by Japanese studios. In 1972, Dodes'ka-den producer Yoichi Matsue and his assistant Teruyo Nogami were approached by the Soviet studio Mosfilm for an adaptation of the Russian memoir Dersu Uzala to be directed by Kurosawa. On 1 January 1973, Matsue signed the deal on the condition that Kurosawa receive full creative control. Mosfilm wanted Kurosawa's frequent collaborator Toshiro Mifune to play Dersu, but Matsue convinced them otherwise as Mifune would not be attached to such a long production. Eventually, Tuvan actor Maxim Munzuk was cast. Mosfilm, like Japan's Toho studio that Kurosawa usually worked with, found it impossible to keep the perfectionist director to a tight budget and schedule.\n\nBox office\nDersu Uzala sold 20.4 million tickets in the Soviet Union, and made $1.2 million in the United States and Canada. It also sold 994,988 tickets in France, 32,400 tickets in Sweden, and 48,265 tickets in other EU territories since 1996, adding up to 21,475,653 tickets sold in the Soviet Union and Europe.\n\nReception\nDersu Uzala gained generally favorable reviews among audiences and critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 75% based on 16 reviews, with an average rating of 7.70\/10.\n\nSee also\nDersu Uzala (Russian: \u0414\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0443 \u0423\u0437\u0430\u043b\u0430)\u20141961 Soviet film directed by Agasi Babayan\nDersu Uzala (historic person)\nDersu Uzala (book, 1923)\nList of submissions to the 48th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film\nList of Soviet submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nDersu Uzala at IMDb\nDersu Uzala at AllMovie\nDersu Uzala Info\nStills from Dersu Uzala with Russian text\nDersu Uzala at the Japanese Movie Database (in Japanese)\nDersu Uzala on YouTube\nDersu Uzala an essay by Donald Richie at the Criterion Collection","49":"Dodes'ka-den (Japanese: \u3069\u3067\u3059\u304b\u3067\u3093, Hepburn: Dodesukaden, onomatopoeia term equivalent to \"Clickety-clack\") is a 1970 Japanese drama film directed by Akira Kurosawa. The film stars Yoshitaka Zushi, Kin Sugai, Toshiyuki Tonomura, and Shinsuke Minami. It is based on Sh\u016bgor\u014d Yamamoto's 1962 novel A City Without Seasons and is about a group of homeless people living in poverty on the outskirts of Tokyo.\nDodes'ka-den was Kurosawa's first film in five years, his first without actor Toshiro Mifune since Ikiru in 1952, and his first without composer Masaru Sato since Seven Samurai in 1954. Filming began on April 23, 1970, and ended 28 days later. This was Kurosawa's first-ever color film and had a budget of only \u00a5100 million. In order to finance the film, Kurosawa mortgaged his house, but it failed at the box office, grossing less than its budget, leaving him with large debts and, at sixty-one years old, dim employment prospects. Kurosawa's disappointment culminated one year later on December 22, 1971, when he attempted suicide.\n\nPlot\nThe film is an anthology of overlapping vignettes exploring the lives of a variety of characters who live in a suburban shantytown atop a rubbish dump. The first to be introduced is the boy Rokuchan, who lives in a fantasy world in which he is a trolley driver. In his fantasy world, he drives his tram along a set route and schedule through the dump, reciting the refrain \"Dodeska-den\", \"clickety-clack\", mimicking the sound of his vehicle. His dedication to the fantasy is fanatical. Rokuchan is called \"trolley fool\" (densha baka) by locals and by children who are outsiders. His mother is shown as being concerned that Rokuchan is genuinely mentally challenged. (Rokuchan has earned the  label in several cinematographic writings.)\nRyotaro, a hairbrush maker by trade, is saddled with supporting many children whom his unfaithful wife Misao has conceived in different adulterous affairs, but he is wholeheartedly devoted to them. There also appear a pair of drunken day laborers (Masuda and Kawaguchi) who engage in wife-swapping, only to return to their own wives the next day as though nothing has happened. A stoic, bleak man named Hei is frequented by Ocho, who appears to be his ex-wife, and he watches emotionless as she takes care of his domestic chores. It is eventually revealed that she cheated on him; he does not forgive her.  At the opposite end of the spectrum is Shima, a man with a tic who is always defending his outwardly unpleasant and bullying wife. He flies into a rage when friends criticize her and says that she's always been there for him. A beggar and his son live in a derelict car, a Citroen 2CV. While the father is preoccupied with daydreams of owning a magnificent home, the boy dies tragically of food poisoning. A girl (Katsuko) is raped by her alcoholic uncle and becomes pregnant, and in a fit of irrationality stabs a boy at the liquor shop who has tender feelings for her, not having any other way to vent her emotional turmoil. When her uncle is confronted as a suspect for this abusive act, he decides to gather his meager belongings and flee from the town, barely one step ahead of the investigation. Tanba the chasework silversmith is a sage figure, who disarms a youth swinging a katana sword, and allows a burglar to rob him of his money.\nAfter exploring the setbacks and anguish that surround many of the families in this indigent community, along with the dreams of escape that many of them support to maintain at least a superficial level of calm, the film comes full circle, returning to Rokuchan. As the film ends Rokuchan comes home and takes his imaginary tram conductor hat off and hangs it up.\n\nCast\nYoshitaka Zushi as Rokuchan\nKin Sugai as Okuni, Rokuchan's mother\nToshiyuki Tonomura as Taro\nShinsuke Minami as Ryotaro Sawagami\nYuko Kusunoki as Misao, Sawagami's wife\nJunzabur\u014d Ban as Yukichi Shima\nKiyoko Tange as Shima's wife\nMichio Hino as Ikawa, Shima's guest\nKeiji Furuyama as Matsui, Shima's guest\nTappei Shimokawa as Nomoto, Shima's guest\nKunie Tanaka as Hatsutaro Kawaguchi\nJitsuko Yoshimura as Yoshie, Kawaguchi's wife\nHisashi Igawa as Masuo Masuda\nHideko Okiyama as Tatsu, Masuda's wife\nHiroshi Akutagawa as Hei\nTomoko Naraoka as Ocho\nAtsushi Watanabe as Tanba\nKamatari Fujiwara as Suicidal Old Man\nK\u014dji Mitsui as Stall Operator (cameo)\n\nProduction\nFive years had elapsed since the release of Akira Kurosawa's last film, Red Beard (1965). The Japanese film industry was collapsing as the major studios were slashing their production schedules or shutting down entirely due to television stealing the movie audience. When Kurosawa was let go from the American film Tora! Tora! Tora! by Twentieth Century Fox in 1969, it was rumored that the Japanese director's mental health was deteriorating. Teruyo Nogami, Kurosawa's frequent script supervisor, believes the director needed to make a good film to put that rumor to rest. Dodes'ka-den was made possible by Kurosawa forming the Club of the Four Knights production company with three other Japanese directors; Keisuke Kinoshita, Masaki Kobayashi, and Kon Ichikawa. It was their first and only production.\nIt marks a stylistic departure from Kurosawa's previous works. It has no central story and no protagonist. Instead it weaves together the stories of a group of characters living in a slum as a series of anecdotes. It was his first color film, and he had only ever worked with a few of the actors previously; Kamatari Fujiwara, Atsushi Watanabe, Kunie Tanaka, and Yoshitaka Zushi. It marks the first time Kurosawa had used Takao Saito as principal cinematographer, and Saito became his \"cinematographer of choice\" for the rest of his career. Nogami said that Kurosawa told the crew that this time he wanted to make a film that is \"sunny, light, and endearing.\" She speculated that Dodes'ka-den was his rebuttal to what went wrong on Tora! Tora! Tora!. The script supervisor of the film opined that the director was still recuperating from the shock of what happened on that Hollywood film, and was not operating at full strength. Nogami said that she gets choked up whenever she watches the scene where Rokuchan is called \"trolley crazy\" by children, because she imagines Kurosawa as the boy, with people yelling \"Movie-crazy\" at him. Kurosawa said that he wanted to show younger filmmakers that it did not need to cost a lot of money to make a movie. David A. Conrad wrote that an influence of the surging Japanese New Wave can be felt in this impulse and in the decision to focus on outcasts in contemporary society.\n\nFilming\nIn contrast to Red Beard, which was in production for two years, filming for Dodes'ka-den began on April 23, 1970, and was finished in only 27 days, two months ahead of schedule. According to Stephen Prince, it was shot for standard-ratio 35 mm movie film rather than the anamorphic widescreen that Kurosawa had used since The Hidden Fortress (1958). Prince writes that this was because the director did not like how anamorphic lenses handled color information. As a result, it marks a return to the 1.33:1 aspect ratio he used regularly in the 1940s and early 1950s. Prince also states that Dodes'ka-den marks the first time the director used zoom lenses; a sign of the \"speed and economy\" with which he made the film. Nogami stated that she had never seen Kurosawa as \"quiet and undemanding\" on set as he was for Dodes'ka-den. As an example, she explained how during a nine-minute scene that had to be shot in one take, Junzabur\u014d Ban had trouble memorizing all of his dialogue and caused numerous retakes. Nogami said \"the old Kurosawa\" would have lost his temper and started yelling, but instead he just gently said \"let's try it again.\" and eventually praised Ban when the shot was finally completed. Nogami also related how Fujiwara was well-known for not being able to memorize his lines. While filming an eight-minute scene with Watanabe, Kurosawa finally had had enough and had Nogami give Fujiwara verbal prompts. Nogami said her voice was hard to remove from the final tape. The drawings that cover the walls of Rokuchan's house were initially drawn by Kurosawa at home. But he decided they were too \"grown-up\", and had schoolchildren draw them instead.\n\nTitle\nThe film's title \"Dodeska-den\" are the playacting \"words\" uttered by the boy character to mimic the sound of his imaginary trolley car in motion. It is not a commonly used onomatopoeic word in the Japanese vocabulary, but was invented by author Sh\u016bgor\u014d Yamamoto in Kisetsu no Nai Machi (A City Without Seasons), the original novel on which the film was based. In standard Japanese language, this sound would be described as gatan goton, equivalent to \"clickity-clack\" in English.\n\nReception\nDodes'ka-den was Kurosawa's first film in color. Domestically, it was both a commercial and critical failure upon its initial release. Abroad, however, the film gained an Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Film in the 44th Academy Awards. Its Japanese reception, among other things, sent Kurosawa into a deep depression, and in 1971 he attempted suicide.\nDespite continuing to draw mixed responses, Dodes'ka-den received votes from two artists \u2013 Sion Sono and the Dardenne brothers \u2013 in the British Film Institute's 2012 Sight & Sound polls of the world's greatest films.\n\nAwards\nThe film won the Grand Prix of the Belgian Film Critics Association.\n\nDocumentary and home media\nA significant short 36-minute documentary was made by Toho Masterworks concerning this film, Akira Kurosawa: It Is Wonderful to Create (Toho Masterworks, 2002). The film was released by the Criterion Collection on DVD in 2009, and it includes the documentary by Toho Masterworks.\n\nSee also\nList of submissions to the 44th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film\nList of Japanese submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film\n\nExplanatory notes\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\nDodes'ka-den at IMDb\nDodesukaden (in Japanese) at the Japanese Movie Database\nDodes'ka-den at AllMovie\nDodes'ka-den at the TCM Movie Database","50":"Departures (Japanese: \u304a\u304f\u308a\u3073\u3068, Hepburn: Okuribito, \"one who sends off\") is a 2008 Japanese drama film directed by Y\u014djir\u014d Takita and starring Masahiro Motoki, Ry\u014dko Hirosue, and Tsutomu Yamazaki. The film follows a young man who returns to his hometown after a failed career as a cellist and stumbles across work as a n\u014dkanshi\u2014a traditional Japanese ritual mortician. He is subjected to prejudice from those around him, including from his wife, because of strong social taboos against people who deal with death. Eventually he repairs these interpersonal connections through the beauty and dignity of his work.\nThe idea for Departures arose after Motoki, affected by having seen a funeral ceremony along the Ganges when travelling in India, read widely on the subject of death and came across Coffinman. He felt that the story would adapt well to film, and Departures was finished a decade later. Because of Japanese prejudices against those who handle the dead, distributors were reluctant to release it\u2014until a surprise grand prize win at the Montreal World Film Festival in August 2008. The following month the film opened in Japan, where it went on to win the Academy Prize for Picture of the Year and become the year's highest-grossing domestic film. This success was topped in 2009, when it became the first Japanese production to win the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.\nDepartures received positive reviews, with aggregator Rotten Tomatoes indicating an 80% approval rating from 108 reviews. Critics praised the film's humour, the beauty of the encoffining ceremony, and the quality of the acting, but some took issue with its predictability and overt sentimentality. Reviewers highlighted a variety of themes, but focused mainly on the humanity that death brings to the surface and how it strengthens family bonds. The success of Departures led to the establishment of tourist attractions at sites connected to the film and increased interest in encoffining ceremonies, as well as adaptation of the story for various media, including manga and a stage play.\n\nPlot\nDaigo Kobayashi (Masahiro Motoki) loses his job as a cellist when his orchestra is disbanded. He and his wife Mika (Ry\u014dko Hirosue) move from Tokyo to his hometown in Yamagata, where they live in his childhood home that was left to him when his mother died two years earlier. It is fronted by a coffee shop that Daigo's father had operated before he ran off with a waitress when Daigo was six; since then the two have had no contact. Daigo feels hatred towards his father and guilt for not taking better care of his mother. He still keeps a \"stone-letter\"\u2014a stone which is said to convey meaning through its texture\u2014which his father had given him many years before.\nDaigo finds an advertisement for a job \"assisting departures\". Assuming it to be a job in a travel agency, he goes to the interview at the NK Agent office and learns from the secretary, Yuriko Kamimura (Kimiko Yo), that he will be preparing bodies for cremation in a ceremony known as encoffinment. Though reluctant, Daigo is hired on the spot and receives a cash advance from his new boss, Sasaki (Tsutomu Yamazaki). Daigo is furtive about his duties and hides the true nature of the job from Mika.\nHis first assignment is to assist with the encoffinment of a woman who died at home and remained undiscovered for two weeks. He is beset with nausea and later humiliated when strangers on a bus detect an unsavoury scent on him. To clean himself, he visits a public bath which he had frequented as a child. It is owned by Tsuyako Yamashita (Kazuko Yoshiyuki), the mother of one of Daigo's former classmates.\nOver time, Daigo becomes comfortable with his profession as he completes a number of assignments and experiences the gratitude of the families of the deceased. Though he faces social ostracism, Daigo refuses to quit, even after Mika discovers a training DVD in which he plays a corpse and leaves him to return to her parents' home in Tokyo. Daigo's former classmate Yamashita (Tetta Sugimoto) insists that the mortician find a more respectable line of work and, until then, avoids him and his family.\nAfter a few months, Mika returns and announces that she is pregnant. She expresses hope that Daigo will find a job of which their child can be proud. During the ensuing argument, Daigo receives a call for an encoffinment for Mrs Yamashita. Daigo prepares her body in front of both the Yamashita family and Mika, who had known the public bath owner. The ritual earns him the respect of all present, and Mika stops insisting that Daigo change jobs. At the funeral, Yamashita is permitted to witness the burning of his mother's body through a peephole on the retort and listens to a heartfelt anecdote about death told by the furnace operator.\nSometime later, they learn of the death of Daigo's father. Daigo experiences renewed feelings of anger and tells the others at the NK office that he refuses to deal with his father's body. Feeling ashamed of having abandoned her own son long ago, Yuriko tells this to Daigo in an effort to change his mind. Daigo berates Yuriko and storms out before collecting himself and turning around. He goes with Mika to another village to see the body. Daigo is at first unable to recognize him, but takes offence when local funeral workers are careless with the body. He insists on dressing it himself, and while doing so finds a stone-letter that he had given to his father, held tight in the dead man's hands. The childhood memory of his father's face returns to him, and after he finishes the ceremony, Daigo gently presses the stone-letter to Mika's pregnant belly.\n\nProduction\nCultural background\nJapanese funerals are highly ritualized affairs which are generally\u2014though not always\u2014conducted in accordance with Buddhist rites. In preparation for the funeral, the body is washed and the orifices are blocked with cotton or gauze. The encoffining ritual (called n\u014dkan), as depicted in Departures, is rarely performed, and even then only in rural areas. This ceremony is not standardized, but generally involves professional morticians (\u7d0d\u68fa\u5e2b, n\u014dkanshi) ritually preparing the body, dressing the dead in white, and sometimes applying make-up. The body is then put on dry ice in a casket, along with personal possessions and items deemed necessary for the trip to the afterlife.\nDespite the importance of death rituals, in traditional Japanese culture the subject is considered unclean as everything related to death is thought to be a source of kegare (defilement). After coming into contact with the dead, individuals must cleanse themselves through purifying rituals. People who work closely with the dead, such as morticians, are thus considered unclean, and during the feudal era those whose work was related to death became burakumin (untouchables), forced to live in their own hamlets and discriminated against by wider society. Despite a cultural shift since the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the stigma of death still has considerable force within Japanese society, and discrimination against the untouchables has continued.\nUntil 1972, most deaths were dealt with by families, funeral homes, or n\u014dkanshi. As of 2014, about 80% of deaths occur in hospitals, and preparation of the bodies is frequently done by hospital staff; in such cases, the family often does not see the body until the funeral. A 1998 survey found that 29.5% of the Japanese population believed in an afterlife, and a further 40% wanted to believe; belief was highest among the young. Belief in the existence of a soul (54%) and a connection between the worlds of the living and the dead (64.9%) was likewise common.\n\nConception and preproduction\nIn the early 1990s, a 27-year-old Motoki and his friend travelled to India; just before going, at the friend's recommendation he read Shin'ya Fujiwara's Memento Mori (Latin for \"remember that you will die\"). While in India, he visited Varanasi, where he saw a ceremony in which the dead were cremated and their ashes floated down the Ganges.  Witnessing this ceremony of death against a backdrop of bustling crowds going about their lives deeply affected Motoki. When he returned to Japan, he read numerous books on the subject of death, and in 1993 wrote a book on the relationship between life and death: Tenkuu Seiza\u2014Hill Heaven. Among the books he read was Shinmon Aoki's autobiographical Coffinman: The Journal of a Buddhist Mortician (\u7d0d\u68fa\u592b\u65e5\u8a18, N\u014dkanfu Nikki), which exposed Motoki to the world of the n\u014dkanshi for the first time. Motoki said he found a sense of mystery and near-eroticism to the profession that he felt had an affinity with the film world.\nGetting funding for the project was difficult because of the taboos against death, and the crew had to approach several companies before Departures was approved by Yasuhiro Mase and Toshiaki Nakazawa. According to the film's director, Y\u014djir\u014d Takita, a consideration in taking on the film was the age of the crew: \"we got to a certain point in our lives when death was creeping up to become a factor around us\". Kund\u014d Koyama was enlisted to provide the script, his first for a feature film; his previous experience had been in scripting for television and stage. Takita, who had begun his career in the pink film genre before entering mainstream filmmaking in 1986 with Comic Magazine, took on the director's role in 2006, after producer Toshiaki Nakazawa presented him with the first draft of the script. In a later interview he stated \"I wanted to make a film from the perspective of a person who deals with something so universal and yet is looked down upon, and even discriminated against\". Although he knew of the encoffining ceremony, he had never seen one performed.\nProduction of Departures took ten years, and the work was ultimately only loosely adapted from Coffinman; later revisions of the script were worked on collaboratively by the cast and crew. Although the religious aspects of funerals were important in the source work, the film did not include them. This, together with the fact that filming was completed in Yamagata and not Aoki's home prefecture of Toyama, led to tensions between the production staff and the author. Aoki expressed concern that the film was unable to address \"the ultimate fate of the dead\". The first edition of the book was broken into three parts; the third, \"Light and Life\", was an essay-like Buddhist musing on life and death, regarding the \"light\" seen when one perceived the integration of life and death, that is absent from the film. Aoki believed the film's humanistic approach did away with the religious aspects that were central to the book\u2014the emphasis on maintaining connections between the living and the dead that he felt only religion could provide\u2014and refused to allow his name and that of his book to be used. For the new title, Koyama coined the term okuribito as a euphemism for n\u014dkanshi, derived from the words okuru (\"to send off\") and hito (\"person\").\nWhile the book and film share the same premise, the details differ considerably; Aoki attributed these changes to the studio making the story more commercial. Both feature a protagonist who endures uneasiness and prejudice because of his job as a n\u014dkanshi, undergoes personal growth as a result of his experiences, and finds new meaning in life when confronted with death. In both, the main character deals with societal prejudices and misunderstandings over his profession.  In Coffinman, the protagonist was the owner of a pub-caf\u00e9 that had gone out of business; during a domestic squabble his wife threw a newspaper at him, in which he found an ad for the n\u014dkanshi position.  He finds pride in his work for the first time when dealing with the body of a former girlfriend. Koyama changed the protagonist from a bar owner to cellist as he wanted cello orchestration for the film score.  Other differences included moving the setting from Toyoma to Yamagata for filming convenience, making the \"letter-stone\" a greater part of the plot, and an avoidance of heavier scenes, such as religious ones and one in which Aoki talks of seeing \"light\" in a swarm of maggots. Koyama also added the subplot in which Daigo is able to forgive his late father; taken from a novel he was writing, it was intended to close the story with \"some sense of happiness\".\n\nCasting\nMotoki, by then in his early 40s and having built a reputation as a realist, was cast as Daigo. Veteran actor Tsutomu Yamazaki was selected for the role of Sasaki; Takita had worked with Yamazaki on We Are Not Alone (1993). Although the character of Mika was initially planned as being the same age as Daigo, the role went to pop singer Ry\u014dko\nHirosue, who had previously acted in Takita's Himitsu (Secret) in 1999. Takita explained that a younger actress would better represent the lead couple's growth out of naivety. In a 2009 interview, Takita stated that he had cast \"everyone who was on my wish list\".\nMotoki studied the art of encoffinment first-hand from a mortician, and assisted in an encoffining ceremony; he later stated that the experience imbued him with \"a sense of mission ... to try to use as much human warmth as I could to restore [the deceased] to a lifelike presence for presentation to her family\". Motoki then drilled himself by practising on his talent manager until he felt he had mastered the procedure, one whose intricate, delicate movements he compared to those of the Japanese tea ceremony. Takita attended funeral ceremonies to understand the feelings of bereaved families, while Yamazaki never participated in the encoffinment training. Motoki also learned how to play a cello for the earlier parts of the film.\nTo provide realistic bodies while preventing the corpses from moving, after a lengthy casting process the crew chose extras who could lie as still as possible. For the bath house owner Tsuyako Yamashita, this was not possible owing to the need to see her alive first, and a search for a body double was unfruitful. Ultimately, the crew used digital effects to transplant a still image of the actor during the character's funeral scene, allowing for a realistic effect.\n\nFilming and post-production\nThe non-profit organization Sakata Location Box was established in December 2007 to handle on-location matters such as finding extras and negotiating locations.  After deciding to shoot in Sakata, Location Box staff had two months to prepare for the eighty members of the film crew. Negotiations were slow, as many local property owners lost interest after learning that the filming would involve funeral scenes; those who agreed insisted that shooting take place outside of business hours.\n\nToyama was both the setting of Coffinman and Takita's home prefecture, but filming was done in Yamagata; this was largely because the national N\u014dkan Association, headquartered in Hokkaido, had a branch office in Sakata. Some preliminary scenes of snowy landscapes were shot in 2007, and primary filming began in April 2008, lasting 40 days. Locations included Kaminoyama, Sakata, Tsuruoka, Yuza, and Amarume.  The NK Agent office was filmed in a three-storey, Western-style building in Sakata built in 1922.  Originally a restaurant named Kapp\u014d Obata, it went out of business in 1998. The Kobayashis' caf\u00e9, called Concerto in the film, was located in Kaminoyama in a former beauty salon.  From a hundred candidates, Takita chose it for its atmosphere as an aged building with a clear view of the nearby river and surrounding mountain range.  The scene of the shooting of the training DVD took place in the Sakata Minato-za, Yamagata's first movie theatre, which had been closed since 2002.\nThe soundtrack to Departures was by Joe Hisaishi, a composer who had gained international recognition for his work with Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli. Before shooting began, Takita asked him to prepare a soundtrack which would represent the separation between Daigo and his father, as well as the mortician's love for his wife. Owing to the importance of cellos and cello music in the narrative, Hisaishi emphasized the instrument in his soundtrack; he described the challenge of centring a score around the cello as one of the most difficult things he had ever done. This score was played during shooting, which according to Takita \"allowed [the crew] to visualize many of the emotions in the film\" and thus contributed to the quality of the finished work.\n\nStyle\nAs they are the movie's \"central dramatic piece\", the encoffining ceremonies in Departures have received extensive commentary. Mike Scott, for instance, wrote in The Times-Picayune that these scenes were beautiful and heartbreaking, and Nicholas Barber of The Independent described them as \"elegant and dignified\". James Adams of The Globe and Mail wrote that they were a \"dignified ritual of calming, hypnotic grace, with sleights of hand bordering on the magicianly\". As the film continues, Paul Byrnes of The Sydney Morning Herald opined, the audience gains an improved knowledge of the ceremony and its importance. Viewers see that the ceremonies are not simply about preparing the body, but also about \"bring[ing] dignity to death, respect to the deceased and solace to those who grieve\", through which the encoffiners are able to help repair broken family ties and heal damage done to those left behind.\nThere is an idealization of the n\u014dkanshi as presented in the film. In all but one case, the dead are either young or already made-up, such that \"the viewer can easily tolerate these images on the screen\". The one corpse that had not been found for several days is never shown on screen. No bodies show the gaunt figure of one who has died after a long illness, or the cuts and bruises of an accident victim. Japanologist Mark R. Mullins writes that the gratitude shown in Departures would probably not have occurred in real life; according to Coffinman, there \"is nothing lower on the social scale than the mortician, and the truth of the matter is that [the Japanese people] fear the coffinman and the cremator just as much as death and the corpse\".\n\nIn a montage, scenes of Daigo playing his childhood cello while sitting outdoors are interspersed with scenes of encoffining ceremonies. Byrnes believes that this scene was meant to increase the emotional charge of the film, and Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times considered it a \"beautiful fantasy scene\" through which the camera is \"granted sudden freedom\" from the generally standard shots. Yoshiko Okuyama of the University of Hawaii at Hilo found that Daigo's deft movements while playing the cello mirrored the high level of professionalism which he had reached. Several reviewers, such as Leigh Paatsch of the Herald Sun, questioned the need for the shot. Throughout the film's soundtrack, cello music remains dominant. Takita drew parallels between the instrument and the encoffining ceremony, stating that\n\n... ironically, there is something similar between the process of encoffinment and the act of playing the cello. When you play the cello, the instrument has a human, curvaceous form. The cellist embraces that form when playing the instrument, very loving, affectionate. That's very similar, physically, to the actions of the encoffiner, cradling the body, being tender and gentle with it.\nByrnes found that Departures used the symbol of the cherry blossom, a flower which blooms after the winter only to wither soon afterwards, to represent the transience of life; through this understanding, he wrote, Japanese people attempt to define their own existence. Natural symbols are further presented through the changing seasons, which \"suggest delicate emotional changes\" in the characters, as well as the letter-stones, which represent \"love, communication, [and] the baton being passed from generation to generation\". The film's settings are used to convey various sensations, including the solitude of the countryside and the intimacy of the public bath house. The colour white, manifested through snow, chrysanthemums, and other objects, is prominent in the film; Okuyama suggests that this, together with the classical music and ritualized hand gestures, represents the sacredness and purity of the death ceremonies.\nDepartures incorporates aspects of humour, an \"unexpected\" complement to the theme of death which Ebert suggested may be used to mask the audience's fears. Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times opines that, through this use of humour, the film avoids becoming too dark and instead acts as a \"warmhearted blend\" of whimsy and irony. This humour manifests in a variety of manners, such as a scene in which \"a mortified Daigo, naked except for a pair of adult diapers, is the reluctant model\" for an educational video regarding the encoffining process, as well as a scene in which Daigo discovers that the person he is preparing is a trans woman. Takita stated that the addition of humour was deliberate, as \"humans are comical by nature\", and that the humour did not conflict with the film's darker themes.\n\nThemes\nSeveral critics discussed the theme of death found in Departures. Scott highlighted the contrast between the taboo of death and the value of jobs related to it. He also noted the role of the encoffiner in showing \"one last act of compassion\" by presenting the dead in a way which preserved proud memories of their life. Initially, Daigo and his family are unable to overcome the taboos and their squeamishness when faced with death. Daigo is alienated from his wife and friends owing to traditional values. Ultimately it is through his work with the dead that Daigo finds fulfilment, and, as Peter Howell of the Toronto Star concluded, viewers realize that \"death may be the termination of a life, but it's not the end of humanity\". Okuyama writes that, in the end, the film (and the book on which it was based) serves as a \"quiet yet persistent protest\" against the discrimination which people who deal with death continue to face in modern Japan: death is a normal part of life, not something repulsive.\nAlong with this theme of death, Takita believed Departures was about life, about finding a lost sense of feeling human; Daigo gains a greater perspective on life and realises the diversity of people's lives only after encountering them in death. This life includes family bonds: Daigo's coming to terms with his father is a major motif, encoffinment scenes focus on the living family members rather than the dead, and even in the NK Agent office, conversation often revolves around family issues. Mika's pregnancy is the catalyst for her reconciliation with Daigo.\nEbert writes that, as with other Japanese films such as Tokyo Story (Yasujir\u014d Ozu; 1953) and The Funeral (Juzo Itami; 1984), Departures focuses on the effect of death on the survivors; the afterlife is not given much discussion. He considered this indicative of a \"deep and unsensational acceptance of death\" in Japanese culture, one which is to be met not with extreme sorrow, but with contemplation. Takita stated that he intended to focus on the \"dialogue between people who have passed away and the families that survive them\". The film touches on the question of the afterlife: the cremator likens death to \"a gateway\", and Okuyama writes that in this sense the cremator is a gatekeeper and the encoffiners are guides.\nByrnes found that Departures leads one to question the extent of modernity's effect on Japanese culture, noting the undercurrent of \"traditional attitudes and values\" which permeated the film. Although the encoffining ceremony was traditionally completed by the dead person's family, a decreased interest in it opened a \"niche market\" for professional encoffiners. Okuyama wrote that, through this film, Takita was filling a \"spiritual loss\" caused by the departure from tradition in modern Japan. Tadao Sato connected this theme of modernity to that of death, explaining that the film's unusually non-bitter treatment of death demonstrated an evolution in Japanese feelings about life and death. He considered the film's treatment of n\u014dkan as an artistic rather than religious ceremony to reflect the agnostic attitudes of modern Japan.\n\nRelease\nThe taboo subject of Departures made prospective distributors wary of taking on the film. Surveys conducted at pre-release screenings placed it at the bottom of the list of films audiences wanted to see. Ultimately, the film's debut at the Montreal World Film Festival in August 2008, which was rewarded with the festival's grand prize, provided the necessary incentive for distributors to select Departures; it finally received its domestic Japanese release on 13 September 2008. Even then, owing to the strong taboo against death, Takita was worried about the film's reception and did not anticipate commercial success, and others expressed concern that the film lacked a clear target audience.\nThis fear was misplaced; Departures debuted in Japan at fifth place, and during the fifth week of its run hit its peak position at third place. It sold 2.6 million tickets in Japan and generated 3.2 billion yen ($32 million) in box office revenue in the five months after its debut. The film was still showing in 31 theatres when its success at the Academy Awards in February 2009 renewed interest; the number of screens on which it was showing was increased to 188 and the film earned another \u00a52.8 billion ($28 million), making a total of \u00a56 billion ($60 million). This made Departures the highest-grossing domestic film and 15th top-grossing film overall for 2008. Executive producer Yasuhiro Mase credited this success to the effects of the Great Recession on Japan: viewers who were seeking employment after recently being downsized empathized with Daigo.\nFrom the beginning an international release of the film was intended; as English is considered a key language in international film festivals, English subtitles were prepared. The translation was handled by Ian MacDougall. He believed that the workings of the mortician's world were as far from the experience of most Japanese as from that of a non-Japanese audience. As such he felt a faithful translation was best, without going far to accommodate foreign audiences to unfamiliar cross-cultural elements.\nIn September 2008, ContentFilm acquired the international rights to Departures, which by that time had been licensed for screening in countries such as Greece, Australia, and Malaysia; the film was ultimately screened in 36 countries. North American distribution was handled by Regent Releasing,\nand Departures received a limited release in nine theatres beginning on 29 May 2009. Overall, the film earned almost $1.5 million during its North American run before closing on 24 June 2010. In the United Kingdom, Departures premiered on 4 December 2009 and was distributed by Arrow Film Distributors. The film attained a worldwide gross of nearly $70 million.\n\nAdaptations and other media\nBefore Departures premiered, a manga adaptation by Akira Sas\u014d was serialized in twelve instalments in the bi-weekly Big Comic Superior, from February to August 2008. Sas\u014d agreed to take on the adaptation as he was impressed by the script. He had the opportunity to view the film before beginning the adaptation, and came to feel that a too-literal adaptation would not be appropriate. He made changes to the settings and physical appearances of the characters, and increased the focus on the role of music in the story. Later in 2008 the serial was compiled in a 280-page volume released by Shogakukan.\nOn 10 September 2008, three days before the Japanese premiere of Departures, a soundtrack album for the film\u2014containing nineteen tracks from the film and featuring an orchestral performance by members of the Tokyo Metropolitan and NHK Symphony Orchestras\u2014was released by Universal Music Japan. Pop singer Ai provided lyrics to music by Hisaishi for the image song \"Okuribito\"; performed by Ai with an arrangement for cellos and orchestra, the single was released by Universal Sigma and Island Records on 10 September 2008 along with a promotional video. Sheet music for the film's soundtrack was published by KMP in 2008 (for cello and piano) and Onky\u014d in 2009 (for cello, violin, and piano).\nShinobu Momose, a writer specializing in novelizations, adapted Departures as a novel. It was published by Shogakukan in 2008. That year the company also released Ishibumi (Letter-Stone), an illustrated book on the themes of the film told from the point of view of a talking stone; this book was written by Koyama and illustrated by Seitar\u014d Kurota. The following year Shogakukan published an edition of Koyama's first draft of the screenplay. A stage version of the film, also titled Departures, was written by Koyama and directed by Takita. It debuted at the Akasaka ACT Theater on 29 May 2010, featuring kabuki actor Nakamura Kankur\u014d as Daigo and Rena Tanaka as Mika. The story, set seven years after the close of the film, concerns the insecurities of the couple's son over Daigo's profession.\n\nHome releases\nA dual-layer DVD release, with special features including trailers, making-of documentaries, and a recorded encoffining ceremony, was released in Japan on 18 March 2009. A North American DVD edition of Departures, including an interview with the director, was released by Koch Vision on 12 January 2010; the film was not dubbed, but rather presented with Japanese audio and English subtitles. A Blu-ray edition followed in May. This home release received mixed reviews. Franck Tabouring of DVD Verdict was highly complimentary toward the film and the digital transfer, considering its visuals clean and sharp and the audio (particularly the music) \"a pleasure to listen to\". Thomas Spurlin, writing for DVD Talk, rated the release as \"Highly Recommended\", focusing on the \"unexpected powerhouse\" of the film's quality. Another writer for the website, Jeremy Mathews, advised readers to \"Skip It\", finding the DVD an apt presentation of the source material\u2014which he considered to \"reduce itself to clumsy, mug-filled attempts at broad comedy and awkward, repetitive tear-jerker scenes\". Both DVD Talk reviews agreed that the audio and visual quality were less than perfect, and that the DVD's extra contents were poor; Mathews described the interview as the director answering \"dull questions in a dull manner\".\n\nReception\nReviews\nDepartures received generally positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes sampled 108 reviewers and judged an 80% approval rating, with an average score of 7.06 out of 10. The website's critical consensus states, \"If slow and predictable, Departures is a quiet, life affirming story\". The aggregator Metacritic gives the film 68 out of 100, based on 27 reviews.\n\nDomestic reviews\nInitial reviews in Japan were positive. In Kinema Junpo, Tokitoshi Shioda called Departures a turning point in Takita's career, a human drama capturing both laughter and tears, while in the same publication Masaaki Nomura described the film as a work of supple depth that perhaps indicated a move into Takita's mature period, praising the director for capturing a human feeling from Motoki's earnest encoffining performance. Writing in the Yomiuri Shimbun, Seichi Fukunaga complimented Takita for using a moving, emotive story laden with humour to reverse prejudice against a taboo subject. He commended the performances of Motoki and Yamazaki, particularly their playing the serious Daigo against the befuddled Sasaki.\nIn the Asahi Shimbun, Sadao Yamane found the film admirably constructed and extolled the actors' performances. Yamane was especially impressed by the delicate hand movements Motoki displayed when he performed the encoffinment ceremony. Tomomi Katsuta in the Mainichi Shimbun found Departures a meaningful story that made the viewer think about the different lives people live, and the significance of someone dying. Writing in the same newspaper, Takashi Suzuki thought the film memorable but predictable, and Y\u016bji Takahashi opined that the film's ability to find nobility in a prejudiced subject was an excellent accomplishment. Sh\u014dko Watanabe gave Departures four out of five stars in The Nikkei newspaper, praising the actors' unforced performances.\nFollowing the success of Departures at the Academy Awards, critic Sabur\u014d Kawamoto found the film to show a Japan that the Japanese could relate to, in that, in a nation whose customs put great weight on visits to ancestral graves, a death was always a family affair.  He believed the film had a samurai beauty to it, with its many scenes of families sitting seiza. Critic Y\u016bichi Maeda gave the film a 90% rating, and credited the performances of the two leads for much of the film's success. He praised its emotional impact and its balance of seriousness and humour, but was more critical of the father\u2013son relationship, which he considered overdone. Maeda attributed the film's international success, despite its heavily Japanese content, to its clear depiction of Japanese views on life and death. He found the film's conceptual scale to have an affinity to that of Hollywood (something he considered lacking in most Japanese films).\nReviewer Takur\u014d Yamaguchi gave the film an 85% rating, and found the treatment of its subject charming. He praised its quiet emotional impact and humour, the interweaving of northern Japan scenery with Hisaishi's cello score, and the film's Japanese spirit. Media critic Sadao Yamane found a moving beauty in the dextrous hand movements Sasaki teaches Daigo for preparing bodies, and believed that a prior reading of the original script would deepen the viewer's understanding of the action. Mark Schilling of The Japan Times gave the film four stars out of five, praising the acting though criticizing the apparent idealization of the encoffiners. He concluded that the film \"makes a good case for the Japanese way of death.\"\n\nInternational reviews\nInternationally, Departures has received mixed\u2014mostly positive\u2014reviews. Ebert gave the film a perfect four stars, describing it as \"rock-solid in its fundamentals\" and highlighting its cinematography, music, and the casting of Yamazaki as Sasaki. He found that the result \"functions flawlessly\" and is \"excellent at achieving the universal ends of narrative\". Derek Armstrong of AllMovie gave the film four stars out of five, describing it as \"a film of lyrical beauty\" which is \"bursting with tiny pleasures\". In a four-star review, Byrnes described the film as a \"moving meditation on the transience of life\" which showed \"great humanity\", concluding \"it's a beautiful film but take two hankies.\" Howell gave the film three stars out of four, praising its acting and cinematography. He wrote that Departures \"quietly subverts aesthetic and emotional expectations\" without ever losing its \"high-minded intent\". In a three-and-a-half star review, Claudia Puig of USA Today described Departures as a \"beautifully composed\" film which, although predictable, was \"emotional, poignant\" and \"profoundly affecting\".\nPhilip French of The Observer considered Departures to be a \"moving, gently amusing\" film, which the director had \"fastidiously composed\". Sharkey found it an \"emotionally wrenching trip with a quiet man\", one which was well cast with \"actors who move lightly, gracefully\" in the various settings. In Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman gave the film a B\u2212, considering it \"tender and, at times, rather squishy\", though certain to affect anyone who had lost a parent. Barber found Departures to be \"heartfelt, unpretentious, [and] slyly funny\", worth watching (though ultimately predictable). Mike Scott gave the film three and a half stars out of four, finding that it was \"a surprisingly uplifting examination of life and loss\", with humour which perfectly complemented the \"moving and meaningful story\", but lent itself to characters \"mug[ging] for the camera\".\nMeanwhile, Kevin Maher of The Times described Departures as a \"verklempt comedy\" with wearisome \"push-button crying\", though he considered it saved by the quality of the acting, \"stately\" directing, and \"dreamy\" soundtrack. Another mixed review was published in The Daily Telegraph, which described the film as a \"safe and emotionally generous crowd-pleaser\" that was not worthy of its Academy Award. Philip Kennicott wrote in The Washington Post that the film was \"as polished as it is heavy-handed\", predictable yet ready to break taboos, immersed in death yet incapable of escaping \"the maddening Japanese taste for sentimentality\". In Variety, Eddie Cockrell wrote that the film offered \"fascinating glimpses\" of the encoffining ceremony but should have had a much shorter runtime. Paatsch gave Departures three stars out of five, describing it as a \"quaintly mournful flick\" that \"unfolds with a delicacy and precision that slowly captivates the viewer\" but considering some scenes, such as the montage, \"needlessly showy flourishes\". Edward Porter of The Sunday Times wrote that the film's success at the Academy Awards could be blamed on \"a case of the Academy favouring bland sentimentality\".\nThe A.V. Club's Keith Phipps gave Departures a C\u2212, writing that though it featured \"handsome shots of provincial life\" and encoffining scenes with a \"poetic quality\", ultimately the film \"drips from one overstated emotion to the next\". A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times that the film was \"perfectly mediocre\", predictable, and banal in its combination of humour and melodrama. Despite its sometimes touching moments, he considered Departures \"interesting mainly as an index of the Academy's hopelessly timid and conventional tastes\". Tony Rayns of Film Comment gave a scathing review in which he denounced the script as \"embarrassingly clunky and obvious\", the acting as merely \"adequate\", and the film as but a \"paean to the good-looking corpse\". Adams gave Departures two out of four stars, praising the emotionally and visually arresting scenes of encoffinments and \"loving attention to the textures, tastes and behaviours of semi-rural Japan\" but condemning the predictability of the plot; he wrote that \"Forty-five minutes in, [viewers have] prepared a mental checklist of every turn that Daigo Kobayashi will face, then negotiate \u2013 and be danged if Takita doesn't deliver on every one\".\n\nAwards\nAt the 32nd Japan Academy Prize ceremony held in February 2009, Departures dominated the competition. It received a total of thirteen nominations, winning ten, including Picture of the Year, Screenplay of the Year (Koyama), Director of the Year (Takita), and Outstanding Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role (Motoki). In the Outstanding Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role category, Hirosue lost to Tae Kimura of All Around Us, while in the Outstanding Achievement in Art Direction category Departures's Tomio Ogawa lost to Paco and the Magical Book's Towako Kuwashima. Hisaishi, nominated for two Outstanding Achievement in Music awards, won for his scoring of Studio Ghibli's animated film Ponyo. In response to the wins, Motoki said \"It feels as if everything miraculously came together in balance this time with Okuribito\".\nDepartures was submitted to the 81st Academy Awards as Japan's submission for the Best Foreign Language Film award. Although eleven previous Japanese films had won Academy Awards in other categories, such as Best Animated Feature or Best Costume Design, the as-yet unattained Best Foreign Language Film award was highly coveted in the Japanese film industry. Departures was not expected to win, owing to strong competition from the Israeli and French submissions (Ari Folman's Waltz with Bashir and Laurent Cantet's The Class, respectively), but was ultimately the victor at the February 2009 ceremony. This was considered a surprise by several film critics, and The New York Times's David Itzkoff termed Departures \"The Film That Lost Your Oscars Pool for You\". Motoki, who was expecting the \"wonderful\" Israeli submission to win, was also surprised; he described himself as a \"hanger-on who just observes the ceremony\", and regretted \"not walk[ing] with more confidence\" upon his arrival.\nDepartures received recognition at a variety of film festivals, including the Audience Choice Award at the 28th Hawaii International Film Festival, the Audience Choice Award at the 15th Vilnius International Film Festival, the Grand Prix des Am\u00e9riques at the 32nd Montreal World Film Festival, and Best Narrative Film at the 20th Palm Springs International Film Festival. Motoki was selected as best actor at several ceremonies, including at the Asian Film Awards, the Asia Pacific Screen Awards, and the Blue Ribbon Awards; he was also viewers' choice for best actor at the Golden Rooster Awards. At the 29th Hong Kong Film Awards, Departures was selected as Best Asian Film, beating three Chinese films  and Ponyo. Following the 21st Nikkan Sports Film Award ceremony, in which Departures won Best Film and Best Director, Takita expressed surprise at the film's awards, saying \"I did not know how well my work would be accepted.\" By December 2009 the film had won 98 awards.\n\nImpact\nAfter the film's success, Sakata Location Box set up a hospitality service called Mukaebito\u2014a pun on the film's Japanese title indicating \"one who greets or picks up\" another, rather than \"one who sends off\". The service maintains shooting locations and provides maps of these locations for tourists. In 2009, Location Box opened the building that served as the NK Agent office to the public. For a fee, visitors could enter and view props from the film. Under a job creation program, between 2009 and 2013 the organization received \u00a530 million from Yamagata Prefecture and \u00a58 million from Sakata City for the building's maintenance and administration. The site attracted nearly 120,000 visitors in 2009, though numbers quickly fell; in 2013 there were fewer than 9,000 visitors. Safety fears due to the building's age led to the Sakata municipal government ending the organization's lease, and the building was closed again at the end of March 2014. At the time, the City Tourism division was considering options, such as limiting visits to the first two floors. The building used as the Concerto caf\u00e9 has been open to the public since 2009 as the Kaminoyama Concerto Museum, and the Sakata Minato-za cinema has also been opened to tourists. Takita's hometown of Takaoka, Toyama, maintains a Film Resources Museum; staff have reported that at times over a hundred Takita fans visit per day.\nThe film's success generated greater interest in encoffining and the n\u014dkanshi. Even the model of hearse driven in the film was merchandised: the Mitsuoka Limousine Type 2-04, a smaller, less expensive version of the film's vehicle, was put on the market on 24 February 2009. The manufacturer, Mitsuoka Motors, is located in Takita's home prefecture of Toyama. In 2013, Kouki Kimura, from a family of n\u014dkanshi, founded the Okuribito Academy together with nurse and entrepreneur Kei Takamaru. It offers training in encoffining, embalming, and related practices.\n\nExplanatory notes\nReferences\nWorks cited\nExternal links\nOfficial website (via the Internet Archive)\nDepartures at IMDb \nDepartures at AllMovie \nDepartures at Rotten Tomatoes \nDepartures at Metacritic","51":"Donald Richie (April 17, 1924 \u2013 February 19, 2013) was an American-born author who wrote about the Japanese people, the culture of Japan, and especially Japanese cinema. Although he considered himself primarily a film historian, Richie also directed a number of experimental films, the first when he was seventeen.\n\nBiography\nRichie was born in Lima, Ohio.  During World War II, he joined the United States Merchant Marine and served aboard Liberty ships as a purser and medical officer. By then he had already published his first work, \"Tumblebugs\" (1942), a short story.\nIn 1947, Richie first visited Japan with the American occupation force, a job he saw as an opportunity to escape from Lima, Ohio. He first worked as a typist, and then as a civilian staff writer for the Pacific Stars and Stripes. While in Tokyo, he became fascinated with Japanese culture, particularly Japanese cinema. He was soon writing movie reviews in the Stars and Stripes. In 1948 he met Kashiko Kawakita who introduced him to Yasujir\u014d Ozu. During their long friendship, Richie and Kawakita collaborated closely in promoting Japanese film in the West. He began composing contemporary music and released a title for ballet at that time.\nAfter returning to the United States, he  enrolled at Columbia University's School of General Studies in 1949 and received a B.S. degree in English in 1953. Richie then returned to Japan as film critic for The Japan Times and in 1959 published his first book, The Japanese Film: Art and Industry, coauthored with Joseph Anderson, which gave the first English language account of Japanese film. The greater tolerance in Japan for male homosexuality than in the United States was one reason he gave for returning to Japan, as he was openly bisexual. He spent much of the second half of the 20th century living and working alone in Tokyo, with the exception of a brief marriage to the American writer Mary Evans from 1961 to 1965. Richie served as Curator of Film at the New York Museum of Modern Art from 1969 to 1972. In 1988, he was invited to become the first guest director at the Telluride Film Festival.\n\nRichie was a prolific author. Among his most noted works on Japan are The Inland Sea, a travel classic, and Public People, Private People, a look at some of Japan's most significant and most mundane people. He has compiled two collections of essays on Japan: A Lateral View and Partial Views. A collection of his writings has been published to commemorate fifty years of writing about Japan: The Donald Richie Reader. The Japan Journals: 1947\u20132004 consists of extended excerpts from his diaries.\nIn 1991, film makers Lucille Carra and Brian Cotnoir produced a film version of The Inland Sea, which Richie narrated. Produced by Travelfilm Company, the film won numerous awards, including Best Documentary at the Hawaii International Film Festival (1991) and the Earthwatch Film Award. It screened at the Sundance Film Festival in 1992.\nAuthor Tom Wolfe described Richie as \"the Lafcadio Hearn of our time, a subtle, stylish, and deceptively lucid medium between two cultures that confuse one another: the Japanese and the American.\"\nAlthough Richie spoke Japanese fluently, he could neither read nor write it proficiently.\nRichie died, aged 88, on February 19, 2013, in Tokyo.\n\nJapanese cinema\nRichie's most widely recognized accomplishments were his analyses of Japanese cinema.  With each subsequent book, he focused less on film theory and more on the conditions in which the films were made. There was an emphasis on the \"presentational\" nature of Japan's cinema, in contrast to the \"representational\" films of the West. In the foreword to Richie's book A Hundred Years Of Japanese Film, Paul Schrader writes, \"Whatever we in the West know about Japanese film, and how we know it, we most likely owe to Donald Richie.\" Richie also penned analyses of two of Japan's best known filmmakers: Yasujir\u014d Ozu and Akira Kurosawa. Because Richie was a friend of Fumio Hayasaka, who composed music for the cinema, he first met Kurosawa on the set of Drunken Angel, the director's initial collaboration with Toshiro Mifune.\nRichie wrote the English subtitles for Akira Kurosawa's films Throne of Blood (1957), Red Beard (1965), Kagemusha (1980) and Dreams (1990).\nIn the 21st century, Richie provided audio commentaries for The Criterion Collection on DVDs of various classic Japanese films, notably those of Ozu (A Story of Floating Weeds and Early Summer), Mikio Naruse (When a Woman Ascends the Stairs), and Kurosawa (Drunken Angel, Rashomon, The Lower Depths, and The Bad Sleep Well), among others.\n\nBooks by Richie\nThe Honorable Visitors.

He is married to his cousin, Osan, but is having an affair with a popular courtesan named Koharu. Jihei has promised twenty-nine times to free her from her five-year contract at the Kinokuni brothel, but he lacks the money required: ten kan of silver. Koharu is desperate to stop her work as a prostitute and asks Jihei to kill her. Jihei says if she dies he will kill himself too, and they decide to commit shinj\u016b.\nWhen Koharu returns to the Kinokuni brothel, a rich merchant named Tahei comes in and says he would like to free her from her contract. Koharu accuses Tahei of spreading rumors about Jihei's lack of wealth. Tahei tells Koharu's madam that he will pay any amount to sleep with Koharu, but the madam tells him that Koharu already has a client for the night, a samurai.\nWhen the samurai arrives, Koharu refuses to make eye contact. The samurai asks Koharu what the issue is, and she explains her contract as well as her plans to commit shinj\u016b with Jihei. The samurai discourages her from suicide, and she realizes doing so would leave her widowed mother with no one to care for her. The samurai pledges to help Koharu pay off her contract, and the two head to bed.\nMeanwhile, Tahei has gone to a bar and is loudly speaking about Koharu's samurai client. Jihei overhears this and heads to the Kinokuni brothel to confront Koharu. When he gets to the brothel, he overhears Koharu and the samurai's conversation. Furious, he tries to stab the samurai through a window, but is apprehended. The samurai ties Jihei's arm to the window and leaves him there.\nTahei then comes across Jihei tied up and mocks him and calls him a thief, assuming that's the reason he's tied up. The samurai comes out and reprimands Tahei for lying, as Jihei stole nothing. He encourages Jihei to kick Tahei, which Jihei does. A mob then surrounds Tahei and chases him out of town.\nBack inside the teahouse, Jihei realizes the samurai is his brother, Magoemon, in disguise. Jihei begs for Magoemon's forgiveness and scolds Koharu for cheating on him. Magoemon tells Jihei he is a fool for letting Koharu seduce him, and says that he saw Koharu for a fraud the moment he met her. Magoemon tells Jihei that Osan's father, Gozaemon, is upset with Jihei for his affair with Koharu and plans to take Osan back. Jihei promises he is done with Koharu. Magoemon finds a letter addressed to Koharu from Osan, but doesn't mention it to Jihei.\nA few weeks later in Jihei's home and paper shop, Osan's servants, Otama and Sangoro, are late for dinner. They arrive with Jihei's children, Kantaro and Osue, and Otama tells Osan that she saw Magoemon heading toward the shop with Osan's mother. Osan wakes up Jihei who was napping, and he starts pretending to work. When Osan's mother arrives with Magoemon, she tells Jihei that she heard a rumor from a member of her prayer group that a wealthy merchant from Tenma was set to free Koharu in a few days. She assumes that said merchant is Jihei, but Jihei tells her it must be Tahei. Osan's mother is consoled but say that Gozaemon will not be as easily convinced. She asks Jihei for a written oath that he is no longer involved with Koharu, which he obliges, and she leaves.\nLater that night, Osan finds Jihei crying. She thinks he is crying because he still loves Koharu, but he insists he doesn't. Osan reveals that she wrote a letter to Koharu and begged her to betray Jihei so he would get over her because she was worried that he would kill himself. Osan says she is afraid Koharu will kill herself now that Jihei has left her. Jihei says they need 150 ry\u014d in order to free Koharu from her contract. Osan takes 80 ry\u014d from a secret stash and gives it to Jihei. She then takes all her clothing and tells Jihei to pawn it for the remaining 70 ry\u014d. As Jihei is about to leave for the pawn shop, Gozaemon arrives and orders Jihei to write a letter of divorce from Osan. When Jihei refuses, Gozaemon drags Osan away from the shop. Osan resists and begs to stay but Jihei remains silent. Once she has left, Jihei breaks into tears and begins tearing apart the shop: throwing papers, pushing over furniture, and even pushing over walls, which collapse with ease.\nJihei finds Koharu back at the Kinokuni brothel, and the two run until they reach a graveyard where they make love. Afterwards, Koharu suggests Jihei kill her where they stand and then go to another location to kill himself. She thinks they shouldn't die together because Jihei is still married to Osan. Jihei cuts off his topknot, which he says makes him a priest, nullifying his marriage to Osan, and therefore he can die with Koharu. Likewise, Koharu then lets her hair down and declares herself a nun. They then hear the Daicho Temple bell, marking dawn. They venture into the wilderness where Jihei kills Koharu, pulls off her obi, and hangs himself with it with the help of kuroko on a lone torii on a hill. The final shot shows Jihei and Koharu laying opposite one another on a mat beneath the bridge as they were at the beginning of the film.\n\nCast\nBackground\nThis play is often performed with puppets. In the film, the story is performed with live actors but makes use of Japanese theatrical traditions such as the kuroko (stagehands dressed entirely in black) who invisibly interact with the actors, and the set is non-realist. The kuroko prepare for a modern-day presentation of a puppet play while a voice-over, presumably the director, calls on the telephone to find a location for the penultimate scene of the lovers' suicide. Soon, human actors substitute for the puppets, and the action proceeds in a naturalistic fashion, until from time to time the kuroko intervene to accomplish scene shifts or heighten the dramatic intensity of the two lovers' resolve to be united in death. The stylized sets and the period costumes and props simultaneously convey a classical theatricality and contemporaneous modernity.\nJihei's fatal love interest, Koharu the prostitute, and his neglected wife, Osan, are both played by actress Shima Iwashita.\n\nHome media\nThis film was released on DVD in Japanese with English subtitles in Region 1 on 30 January 2001.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nDouble Suicide at IMDb\nDouble Suicide at AllMovie\nDouble Suicide at the TCM Movie Database\nDouble Suicide an essay by Claire Johnston at the Criterion Collection\n\"\u5fc3\u4e2d\u5929\u7db2\u5cf6 (Shinj\u016b: Ten no Amijima)\" (in Japanese).

It was originally founded on October 12, 1994, as a live-action film studio by Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg, and David Geffen (which together form the SKG of DreamWorks SKG), of which they owned 72%. The studio formerly distributed its own and third-party films. It has produced or distributed more than ten films with box-office grosses of more than $100 million each.\nDreamWorks Pictures was sold to Viacom, parent of Paramount Pictures in February 2006 (this version is now named DW Studios). In 2008, DreamWorks announced its intention to end its partnership with Paramount and made a deal to produce films with India's Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group, re-creating DreamWorks Pictures as an independent entity. The following year, DreamWorks entered into a distribution agreement with Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, wherein Disney would distribute DreamWorks films through the Touchstone Pictures label; the deal continued until August 2016. Since October 2016, Universal Pictures has distributed most of the films produced by DreamWorks Pictures. Currently, DreamWorks operates out of offices at Universal Studios Hollywood.\nDreamWorks is also distinct from its former animation division of the same name, which was spun off in 2004 and became a subsidiary of NBCUniversal in 2016. Spielberg's company continues to use the original DreamWorks trademarks under license from DreamWorks Animation.\n\nHistory\nDreamWorks SKG founding and Universal distribution\nThe original company was founded following Jeffrey Katzenberg's resignation from The Walt Disney Company in 1994. Katzenberg approached Steven Spielberg and David Geffen about forming a live-action and animation film studio, which had not been done in decades due to the risk and expense, but all three were very successful. They agreed on three conditions: They would make fewer than nine movies a year, they would be free to work for other studios if they chose, and they would go home in time for dinner. They officially founded DreamWorks SKG on October 12, 1994, with financial backing of $33 million from each of the three partners plus $500 million from Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, and $300 million from CJ Group heiress Miky Lee. Lee's CJ Group would acquire distribution rights to DreamWorks films in Asia except Japan. Their new studio was based at offices on the Universal Studios lot, in the same bungalow as Amblin Entertainment. Despite access to sound stages and sets, DreamWorks preferred to film motion pictures on location. Usually, however, the company would film in a soundstage or set in a major studio.\nIn December 1994, DreamWorks Television was formed after DreamWorks agreed to a $200 million seven-year television production joint venture with Capital Cities\/ABC. The company was set up to produce series for broadcast networks, cable channels and first run syndication, with no first-look guarantee for ABC, but financial incentives favored the network. Their first show, Champions, was scheduled as a mid-season replacement for ABC. Dan McDermott was named the division's chief executive in June 1995. DreamWorks Television's first success was Spin City on ABC, the parent company of which was bought by The Walt Disney Company in February 1996. In 2002, the DreamWorks joint venture agreement with ABC ended. That agreement was replaced by a development agreement with NBC, with a first look clause. In 2013, DreamWorks Television merged with Amblin Television.\nIn 1995, traditional animation artists from Amblimation joined the new studio, which led to DreamWorks buying part of Pacific Data Images, a company specializing in visual effects, and renaming it PDI\/DreamWorks in 2000. Both were software divisions and would merge later on. By then, DreamWorks had the traditional animators working for their animation department, and the computer animators worked on CG films. Amblimation would be shut down in 1997, leading the staff to join DreamWorks Animation. The same year, DreamWorks Interactive, a computer and video game developer and joint venture between DreamWorks and Microsoft, was founded. On February 24, 2000, Electronic Arts announced the acquisition of DreamWorks Interactive and merged it with EA Pacific and Westwood Studios to form EA Los Angeles, later Danger Close Games.\nIn June 1995, DreamWorks announced that it had signed a $1 billion deal with MCA Inc. (then parent company of Universal Pictures) to distribute its theatrical releases in other countries and its home video releases worldwide over 10 years, while DreamWorks itself would distribute them for the company as a film production label in America. MCA also bought a 2% stake in the company for $54 million.\nIn 1996, the company's record label, DreamWorks Records, was founded, the first project of which was George Michael's album Older. The first band signed to the label was eels, who released their debut album Beautiful Freak that year. The record company never lived up to expectations, though, and was sold in October 2003 to Universal Music Group, which operated the label as DreamWorks Nashville. That label was shut down in 2005 when its flagship artist, Toby Keith, departed to form his own label.\nIn 1997, DreamWorks Pictures released its first three feature films, The Peacemaker, a film about terrorism; Amistad, Spielberg's first film for the studio about an African slave rebellion and the aftermath of the massacre; and Mouse Hunt, the studio's first family film about two brothers trying to fight a mischievous mouse.\nIn 1998, the United States 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lawsuit against DreamWorks for trademark infringement by DreamWorks Production Group, Inc., a company mostly specializing in Star Trek conventions. The same year, DreamWorks Animation produced its first full-length animated features, Antz and The Prince of Egypt, which were distributed by DreamWorks Pictures. DreamWorks Pictures continued to distribute DreamWorks Animation productions through their distribution name until 2004.\nIn 2000, DreamWorks was planning on building a studio backlot after buying 1,087 acres of land in the Playa Vista area in Los Angeles. It was to be complete with 18 sound stages, with many office buildings and a lake. There would also be new homes, schools, churches, and museums. The project was to be completed in 2001, but was cancelled for financial reasons. Starting in 1999, DreamWorks won three consecutive Academy Awards for Best Picture for American Beauty, Gladiator and A Beautiful Mind (the latter two were co-productions with Universal Pictures). DreamWorks became the first new major Hollywood motion picture studio since RKO Pictures was founded in 1928. Go Fish Pictures, a division of DreamWorks with the objective to distribute art-house, independent and foreign films, was founded in 2000. The division experienced success with the anime films Millennium Actress (2003) and Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence (2004), respectively, which led them to venture into releasing live-action films, with the release of The Chumscrubber. However, The Chumscrubber was a commercial and critical failure, which led DreamWorks to shut down the division in 2007 shortly after the release of the Japanese film Casshern. In 2002, DreamWorks signed a deal with In Demand.\nFor the period beginning October 1, 2004 to January 31, 2006, DreamWorks Pictures distributed its films in the North American domestic theatrical and worldwide television market, with international theatrical and worldwide home entertainment distribution by Universal Pictures. On October 27, 2004, DreamWorks Animation was spun off into a separate public company.\nDavid Geffen admitted that DreamWorks came close to bankruptcy twice. Under Katzenberg's watch, the studio suffered a $125 million loss on Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas, and also overestimated the DVD demand for Shrek 2. In 2005, out of their two large budget pictures, War of the Worlds was produced as a joint effort with Paramount Pictures which was the first to reap a significant amount of profits, while The Island bombed at the domestic box office but turned a profit internationally through Warner Bros. Pictures.\n\nParamount ownership\nIn December 2005, the original Viacom, the then-parent of Paramount Pictures, agreed to purchase the live-action studio, still keeping the original name and producing\/distribution name. The deal was valued at approximately $1.6 billion, an amount that included about $400 million in debt assumptions. The acquisition of the live-action DreamWorks studio was completed by the second iteration of Viacom, which had recently split from the original at the end of 2005, on February 1, 2006.\nOn March 17, 2006, Viacom agreed to sell a controlling interest in the DreamWorks Pictures live-action library to Soros Strategic Partners and Dune Entertainment II. The film library was valued at $900 million. Paramount Pictures retained the worldwide distribution rights to those films, as well as various ancillary rights, including music publishing (the music publishing rights were later licensed to Sony\/ATV Music Publishing when the company acquired Viacom's Famous Music subdivision), sequels and merchandising. The sale was completed on May 8, 2006. On February 8, 2010, Viacom repurchased Soros' controlling stake in the DreamWorks Pictures library for around $400 million.\n\nReliance-Spielberg joint venture\nIn June 2008, it was reported that DreamWorks was looking for financing that would allow it to continue operations, but as an independent production company, once its deal with Paramount ended later that year. Several public equity funds were approached for financing, including Blackstone Group, Fuse Global, TPG Capital and several others, but all passed on the deal given their understanding of the Hollywood markets. On September 22, 2008, it was announced that DreamWorks closed a deal with Indian investment firm Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group to create a $1.2 billion stand-alone production company and end its ties with Paramount. In January 2009, Spielberg entered a licensing agreement with DreamWorks Animation to use the DreamWorks trademarks, logo, and name for film productions and releases.\nOn February 9, 2009, DreamWorks Pictures entered into a long-term, 30-picture distribution deal with Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, by which DreamWorks' films would be released through the Touchstone Pictures banner, with Disney collecting a 10 percent distribution fee. The deal also included co-funding via a $175 million loan by Walt Disney Studios to DreamWorks for production and access to slots in Disney's pay television agreement, then with Starz. The agreement was reported to have come after negotiations broke off with Universal Pictures just days earlier. DreamWorks raised $325 million from Reliance Entertainment and an additional $325 million in debt in 2009. On August 18, 2009, DreamWorks and Reliance signed a three-year, $825 million pact for up to six films a year.\nDreamWorks' slate of films in 2011, I Am Number Four, Cowboys & Aliens, and Fright Night failed, while The Help, Real Steel and Spielberg's War Horse had success at the box office. This left DreamWorks so financially drained that by 2011, the company was seeking additional funding from Reliance. Reliance gave a $200 million investment on April 10, 2012. Under the deal, DreamWorks Pictures scaled back production to three films per year and sought co-financiers on big budget films, such as 20th Century Fox, who co-financed and handled international distribution for Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The company continued to have Disney distribute and market their films. On August 29, 2012, after re-negotiating their agreement with Disney, DreamWorks formed a deal with Mister Smith Entertainment to distribute its films internationally, while Disney would continue to distribute in North America, Latin America, Australia, Russia, and some territories in Asia.\n\nAmblin Partners venture\nOn September 2, 2015, it was reported that DreamWorks and Disney would not renew their distribution deal, which was set to expire in August 2016, with The Light Between Oceans being released in September as the final DreamWorks film distributed by Disney under their original distribution agreement. During that time, DreamWorks was in early negotiations with Universal Pictures to distribute its upcoming films. The contract allowing Spielberg to license the DreamWorks name and logo from Jeffrey Katzenberg's DreamWorks Animation was set to expire on January 1, 2016, leading to media speculation that Spielberg would not renew the pact. Disney retained the film rights to the fourteen DreamWorks films it released, as well as acquiring the \"DreamWorks II Distribution Co. LLC\" copyright from DreamWorks and Reliance on December 11, 2015.\nOn December 16, 2015, Spielberg, Reliance, Entertainment One and Participant Media partnered to launch the content production company Amblin Partners, relegating DreamWorks to a brand for adult-themed films produced under the new company. In addition to DreamWorks, the new company also would produce films under the Amblin Entertainment and Participant banners. On the same day, Amblin Partners announced a five-year distribution deal with Universal, under which the company's films would be distributed and marketed by either the main Universal label or its specialty label, Focus Features. The Girl on the Train was the first film released under the new agreement, though a few films, like Ghost in the Shell and The Post were released by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox respectively.\n\nLogo\nOriginal\nThe original DreamWorks logo features a boy sitting on a crescent moon with a fishing rod at night. The general idea for the logo was the idea of the company's founder, Steven Spielberg, who wanted a CGI image. Illustrator Robert Hunt was commissioned to execute the idea as a painting, and he used his son as the model. The logo was then turned into a motion graphic at Industrial Light & Magic, in collaboration with Kaleidoscope Films, Dave Carson and Clint Goldman. It was animated by ILM animation supervisor Wes Takahashi. Music accompanying the logo to start in many live-action DreamWorks films was specially composed by John Williams.\n\nAnimation\nThe reimagined animation logo had music adapted from the track \"Fairytale\" for Shrek, based on the children's picture book of the same name by author William Steig. The logo was composed by Harry Gregson-Williams and made its debut in 2004, with the release of Shrek 2. Two years after its acquisition by Universal Pictures in 2016, the logo received a new fanfare composed by John Powell and incorporate some cues from Shrek 2 and tones from Williams' original DreamWorks fanfare to create the music for the logo. The new fanfare debuted in 2019, with the release of How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, for which Powell also composed the score for. In 2022, Harry Gregson-Williams composed a remastered version of the fanfare, with the debut of Puss in Boots: The Last Wish.\n\nDreamWorks Home Entertainment\nDreamWorks Home Entertainment was a home media unit of DreamWorks Pictures and banner for other home media units, formed on March 10, 1998. Its releases were first distributed by Universal Studios Home Entertainment (initially through CIC Video internationally), a deal that would last until 2006. After DreamWorks was purchased by Paramount Pictures on February 1, 2006, DreamWorks Home Entertainment was merged into Paramount Home Entertainment and started being used as a label for films released under the live-action DreamWorks banner until it was shuttered in around 2009 after when DreamWorks spun itself off from Paramount and became an independent company.\n\nFilmography\nFilm series\nHighest-grossing films\nPrimary owners and distributors\nUniversal Pictures\n(1997\u20132005 for DW Studios, LLC catalog, released on home video from 1998\u20132006 by Universal Studios Home Video)\n(since 2016 for Storyteller Distribution Co., LLC catalog, released on home video from 2017\u20132021 by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment and since 2021 by Studio Distribution Services, LLC., a joint venture between UPHE and Warner Bros.

The film received widespread critical acclaim with praise towards Hamaguchi's direction and screenplay; many declared it the best film of 2021. It was nominated for four awards at the 94th Academy Awards, winning Best International Feature Film, and received numerous other accolades. Drive My Car was the first Japanese film to receive a Best Picture nomination. It has since been called one of the best films of the 2020s and of the 21st century.\n\nPlot\nStage actor and director Y\u016bsuke Kafuku lives in Tokyo with his wife Oto, a screenwriter who conceives her stories after sex and narrates them to him. He learns his lines by listening to tapes recorded by Oto, while driving his red Saab 900 Turbo. After Y\u016bsuke performs in Waiting for Godot, Oto introduces him to young television star K\u014dji Takatsuki. When a theater festival Y\u016bsuke was slated to play in is delayed, he returns home, where he finds his wife having sex with K\u014dji, but does not disturb them. After a car crash, Y\u016bsuke discovers he has glaucoma in one eye and must take eyedrops to prevent blindness. One day, Oto asks to have a serious conversation with Y\u016bsuke. After he spends the day driving alone, Y\u016bsuke returns home to find Oto dead from a brain hemorrhage. After the funeral, Y\u016bsuke breaks down while performing the title role in Uncle Vanya.\nTwo years later, Y\u016bsuke accepts a residency in Hiroshima to direct a multilingual production of Uncle Vanya. The theatre festival requires that he be chauffeured in his own car for insurance reasons, and despite his initial reluctance, he eventually bonds with his reserved young driver, Misaki Watari. With the help of dramaturge Gong Yoon-su, Y\u016bsuke casts a diverse group of actors to perform in their native languages. He is impressed by Lee Yoo-na, a mute actress who communicates in Korean Sign Language, and he also unexpectedly casts K\u014dji as Uncle Vanya.\nAfter a rehearsal, K\u014dji invites Y\u016bsuke for a drink, where the young actor pushes against harsh assessments of his character but admits to his unrequited love for Oto. He scolds someone for taking a photo of him. Yoon-su invites Y\u016bsuke and Misaki to dinner with his wife, who is revealed to be Yoo-na. Driving home, Misaki tells Y\u016bsuke about driving her abusive mother for long hours at a young age. They later visit a garbage facility, where Misaki explains that she drove garbage trucks after leaving her hometown when a landslide destroyed her home and killed her mother.\nDrinking with K\u014dji again, Y\u016bsuke reveals that he thinks he can no longer play Vanya himself, and suggests that K\u014dji's lack of self-control is a personal weakness but a strength as an actor. After K\u014dji slips away to confront a man taking photos of him, Misaki drives them home. Y\u016bsuke reveals that he and Oto lost their young daughter, who would now be Misaki's age; Oto's gift for telling stories after sex was a bond that helped them both cope. Though he knew of his wife's affairs, Y\u016bsuke believes she still loved him, and K\u014dji shares one of Oto's stories that Y\u016bsuke never heard in its entirety.\nThe police interrupt a rehearsal and arrest K\u014dji, as the man he attacked has died from his injuries. Given two days to consider whether to take over as Vanya or else cancel the production, Y\u016bsuke asks Misaki to take him to her childhood home in Hokkaido. Y\u016bsuke shares his guilt for not coming home to face the discussion Oto wanted to have, which might have allowed him to save her life. Misaki reveals that she escaped the landslide but chose not to pull her mother from the wreckage, receiving a scar on her cheek she has chosen not to have treated. They visit the snowy remains of Misaki's childhood home and hug as they both confront their shared grief.\nY\u016bsuke assumes the role of Vanya and gives an impassioned performance before a live audience, including Misaki. Yoo-na meaningfully delivers Sonya's final lines: \"We shall hear the angels, we shall see the whole sky all in diamonds, we shall see how all earthly evil, all our sufferings, are drowned in the mercy that will fill the whole world. And our life will grow peaceful, tender, sweet as a caress\u2026 You've had no joy in your life; but wait, Uncle Vanya, wait\u2026 We shall rest.\" Actors and audience alike are moved by the performance. \nSome time later, Misaki is living in South Korea. Buying groceries, she returns to Y\u016bsuke's red Saab, in which a dog rests. She takes off her surgical mask, revealing that her scar is now barely visible, and drives away.\n\nCast\nHidetoshi Nishijima as Y\u016bsuke Kafuku\nT\u014dko Miura as Misaki Watari\nReika Kirishima as Oto Kafuku, Yusuke's wife\nPark Yu-rim as Lee Yoo-na\nJin Dae-yeon as Gong Yoon-soo\nSonia Yuan as Janice Chang\nAhn Hwitae as Ryu Jeong-eui\nPerry Dizon as Roy Lucelo\nSatoko Abe as Yuhara\nMasaki Okada as K\u014dji Takatsuki\n\nProduction\nThe film is directed by Ryusuke Hamaguchi. The film was originally set in Busan, South Korea, but was changed to Hiroshima due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWriting\nHamaguchi was the co-writer of the filmscript with Takamasa Oe. It is primarily based on \"Drive My Car\" by Haruki Murakami from his 2014 short story collection, Men Without Women. The script also features elements from Murakami's stories \"Scheherazade\" and \"Kino\" (both also part of Men Without Women). For the film version, the co-authors were reported by The New York Times to have \"greatly expanded on the (short) story's central dynamic, which turns on a sexist widowed actor and the much-younger female driver who motors him around in his cherished Saab.\"\n\nCinematography\nCinematographer Hidetoshi Shinomiya was assigned to do the filming for the project.\n\nSet design\nThe original story features a yellow Saab 900 convertible, but it was changed in the film to a red Saab 900 Turbo to visually complement the Hiroshima landscape.\n\nSoundtrack\nThe original score for Drive My Car was composed by musician Eiko Ishibashi. In an interview with Variety, director Hamaguchi said; \"Typically, I don't use a lot of music in my films, but hearing the music Ishibashi made was the first time I thought this could work for the film.\" The soundtrack consists of 12 tracks.\nHamaguchi wished to incorporate the Beatles' song \"Drive My Car\", which the film and story are named after.  However, it was too difficult to get permission for its usage.

The New Yorker.","55":"Dreams (\u5922, Yume) is a 1990 magical realist anthology film of eight vignettes written and directed by Akira Kurosawa, starring Akira Terao, Martin Scorsese, Chish\u016b Ry\u016b, Mieko Harada and Mitsuko Baisho. It was inspired by actual recurring dreams that Kurosawa said he had repeatedly. It was his first film in 45 years in which he was the sole author of the screenplay. An international co-production of Japan and the United States, Dreams was made five years after Ran, with assistance from George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, and funded by Warner Bros. The film was screened out of competition at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival, and has consistently received positive reviews.\nDreams addresses themes such as childhood, spirituality, art, death, and mistakes and transgressions made by humans against nature.\n\nPlot\nThe film does not have a single narrative, but is rather episodic in nature, following the adventures of a \"surrogate Kurosawa\" (often recognizable by his wearing Kurosawa's trademark hat) through eight different segments, or \"dreams\", each one titled.\n\n\"Sunshine Through the Rain\"\nA young boy's mother tells him to stay at home during a day when the sun is shining through the rain, warning him that kitsune (foxes) have their weddings during such weather, and do not like to be seen. He defies her wishes, wandering into a forest where he witnesses the slow wedding procession of the kitsune. He is spotted by them and runs home. His mother meets him at the front door, barring the way, and says that an angry fox had come by the house, leaving behind a tant\u014d knife. The mother gives the knife to the boy and tells him that he must go and beg forgiveness from the foxes, refusing to let him return home unless he does so. She warns that if he does not secure their forgiveness, he must take his own life. Taking the knife, the boy sets off into the mountains, towards the place under the rainbow where the kitsune's home is said to be.\n\n\"The Peach Orchard\"\nOn the spring day of Hinamatsuri (the Doll Festival), a boy spots a small girl dressed in pink in his house. He follows her outside to where his family's peach orchard once was. Living dolls appear before him on the orchard's slopes, and reveal themselves to be the spirits of the peach trees. Because the boy's family chopped down the trees of the orchard, the dolls berate him. However, after realizing that the boy loved the blossoms and did not want the trees to be felled, they agree to give him one last look at the orchard as it once was. They perform a dance to Etenraku that causes the blossoming trees to re-appear. The boy sees the mysterious girl walking among the blooming trees and runs after her, but she and the trees suddenly vanish. He walks sadly through the thicket of stumps where the trees had been, until he sees a single young peach tree, in full bloom, sprouting in her place...\n\n\"The Blizzard\"\nA group of four mountaineers struggle up a mountain path during a horrendous blizzard. It has been snowing for three days and the men are dispirited and ready to give up. One by one they stop walking, giving in to the snow and sure death. The leader endeavors to push on, but he too, stops in the snow. A strange woman (the Yuki-onna of Japanese folklore) appears out of nowhere and attempts to lure the last conscious man into giving in to his death. He resists, shaking off his stupor and her entreaties, to discover that the storm has abated, and that their camp is only a few feet away.\n\n\"The Tunnel\"\nA discharged Japanese company commander is walking down a deserted road at dusk, on his way back home from fighting in the Second World War. He comes to a large concrete pedestrian tunnel, from which a barking and snarling anti-tank dog emerges. The commander walks through the dark tunnel and comes out on the other side. He is followed by the y\u016brei (ghost) of one of his soldiers, Private Noguchi, who had died of severe wounds in the commander's arms. Noguchi's face appears blue with blackened eyes.\nNoguchi seems not to believe that he is dead. Noguchi points to a light emanating from a house on a nearby mountainside, which he identifies as being his parents' home. He is heartbroken, knowing he cannot see them again, even while he remains respectful to the commander. Following the commander's wish that he accept his fate, Noguchi returns into the tunnel.\nThe commander's entire third platoon, led by a young lieutenant brandishing an officer's sword, then marches out of the tunnel. They come to a halt and present arms, saluting the commander. Their faces too are colored blue. The commander struggles to tell them that they are dead, having all been killed in combat, and says that he himself is to blame for sending them into a futile battle. They stand mute in reply. The commander orders them to turn about face, and salutes them in a farewell as they march back into the tunnel. Collapsing in grief, the commander is quickly brought back to his feet by the reappearance of the anti-tank dog.\n\n\"Crows\"\nAn art student finds himself inside the world of Van Gogh's artwork, where he meets the artist in a field and converses with him. Van Gogh relates that his left ear gave him problems during a self portrait, so he cut it off. The student loses track of the artist, and travels through a number of Van Gogh's works trying to find him, concluding with Van Gogh's Wheat Field with Crows.\n\n\"Mount Fuji in Red\"\nA large nuclear power plant near Mount Fuji has begun to melt down. The sky is filled with red fumes and millions of Japanese citizens flee in terror towards the ocean. Eventually, two men, a woman, and her two small children are seen alone at the edge of the sea. The older man, who is dressed in a business suit, explains to the younger man that the rest of the population have drowned themselves in the ocean. He then says that the different colors of the clouds billowing across the rubbish-strewn landscape signify different radioactive isotopes. According to him, red indicates plutonium-239, which can cause cancer; yellow indicates strontium-90, which causes leukemia; and purple indicates cesium-137, which causes birth defects. He then remarks about the foolish futility of color-coding such dangerous gases.\nThe woman, hearing these descriptions, recoils in horror before angrily cursing those responsible and the pre-disaster assurances of safety they had given. The suited man displays contrition, suggesting that he is in part responsible for the disaster. The other man, dressed casually, watches the multicolored radioactive clouds advance upon them. When he turns back towards the others at the shore, he sees the woman weeping: the suit-clad man has leaped to his death. A cloud of red dust reaches them, causing the mother to shrink back in terror. The remaining man attempts to shield the mother and her children by using his jacket to feebly fan away the radioactive billows.\n\n\"The Weeping Demon\"\nA man finds himself wandering around a misty, bleak mountainous terrain. He meets an oni-like man, who is actually a mutated human with a single horn on his head. The \"demon\" explains that there had been a nuclear holocaust which resulted in the loss of nature and animals, towering dandelions taller than humans, and humans sprouting horns. He elaborates that, by dusk, the horns cause them to feel excruciating pain; however, they cannot die, so they simply howl in agony during the night. Many of the \"demons\" were former millionaires and government officials, who are now suffering through a hell befitting for their sins.\nThe \"demon\" warns the man to flee, when the man asks where he should go to, the \"demon\" asks if he too wants to become a demon. The horrified man then runs away from the scene with the \"demon\" in pursuit.\n\n\"Village of the Watermills\"\nA man enters a peaceful, stream-laden village, where he sees children laying flowers on a large stone. He meets an elderly, wise man who is fixing a broken watermill wheel. The elder informs the younger man that residents of the village simply refer to it as \"the village\", and that outsiders call it \"the village of the watermills\". When the younger man inquires about the lack of electricity in the village, the elder explains that the people of his village decided long ago to forsake modern technology, and laments the notion of modern convenience and the pollution of nature.\nThe younger man asks the elder about the stone which children were placing flowers on. The elder tells him that, long ago, an ailing traveler died on that spot. The villagers buried him there and placed the rock there as a headstone. Ever since, it has become customary in the village to offer flowers there. The younger man and the elder hear the sounds of a funeral procession for an old woman nearby. Rather than mourning her death, the people in the procession celebrate joyfully the peaceful end of her long life. The elder goes to join the procession, and the younger man leaves flowers on the stone before departing the village.\n\nCast\nAkira Terao as I (The Dreamer)\nMitsunori Isaki as I (The Young Dreamer)\nMitsuko Baisho as The Dreamer's Mother\nMartin Scorsese as Vincent van Gogh\nChish\u016b Ry\u016b as Old Man\nMieko Harada as The Snow Spirit\nYoshitaka Zushi as Private Noguchi\nToshie Negishi as Woman with Child\nHisashi Igawa as Man at the Nuclear Power Plant\nChosuke Ikariya as The Demon\nSachio Sakai\nNoriko Honma\n\nProduction\nFor the \"Sunshine Through the Rain\" segment, writer-director Akira Kurosawa built a near-exact replica of his childhood home; the nameplate on the gate even reads \"Kurosawa\". During production, Kurosawa showed the actress playing the mother a photo of his own mother, and gave her tips on how to act as her.\nThe setting of the segment \"The Blizzard\" may have been inspired by Kurosawa's personal life, since he confessed to being \"a devotee of mountain climbing\".\nIn \"Crows\", Vincent van Gogh is portrayed by American filmmaker Martin Scorsese. The segment features Prelude No. 15 in D-flat major (\"Raindrop\") by Chopin. The visual effects for this segment were provided by George Lucas and his special effects group Industrial Light & Magic. Additionally, it is the only segment in the film wherein the characters do not speak Japanese, but instead English and French.\nThe \"Village of the Watermills\" segment was filmed at the Daio Wasabi farm in the Nagano Prefecture. The segment, and the film as a whole, ends with an excerpt from \"In the Village\", part of the Caucasian Sketches, Suite No. 1 by the Russian composer Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov. The colorful costumes worn by the villagers during a funeral procession are based on unusual clothes that Kurosawa saw in a remote northern village in his childhood. The idea of the stone in this segment, on which passersby lay flowers, was possibly inspired by a similar stone from Kurosawa's father's home village in Akita prefecture:\n\n Near the main thoroughfare of the village stood a huge rock, and there were always cut flowers on top of it. All the children who passed by it picked wild flowers and laid them atop the stone. When I wondered why they did this and asked, the children said they didn't know. I found out later by asking one of the old men in the village. In the Battle of Boshin, a hundred years ago, someone died at that spot. Feeling sorry for him, the villagers buried him, put the stone over the grave and laid flowers on it. The flowers became a custom of the village, which the children maintained without ever knowing why.\n\nCritical reception\nVincent Canby of The New York Times gave the film a mostly positive review, writing: \"It's something altogether new for Kurosawa, a collection of short, sometimes fragmentary films that are less like dreams than fairy tales of past, present and future. The magical and mysterious are mixed with the practical, funny and polemical.\"\nThe Encyclopedia of International Film praised Kurosawa in relation to Dreams as having \"long been a master of complex narrative. Now he wants to tell what he does.\" It praised the editing and staging in the film as \"hypnotically [serene]\", and called Dreams \"one of the most lucid dreamworks ever placed on film.\"\nDonald Richie and Joan Mellen wrote of the film and of Kurosawa: \"Beyond himself, he is beautiful because the beauty is in the attitude of the director. This is evident not only in the didactic approach, but also in the whole slowness, in the quantity of respect and in the enormous, insolent security of the work. That a director in 1990 could be so strong, so serious, so moral and so hopeful, is already beautiful.\"\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 68% based on 31 reviews, with an average rating of 6.60\/10. The site's critics' consensus reads: \"This late-career anthology by Akira Kurosawa often confirms that Dreams are more interesting to the dreamer than their audience, but the directorial master still delivers opulent visions with a generous dose of heart.\"\n\nHome media\nDreams was released on DVD by Warner Home Video on two occasions: one on March 18, 2003, and the other on August 30, 2011, as part of the Warner Archive Collection.\nThe Criterion Collection released special editions of the film on Blu-ray and DVD on November 15, 2016, in the US. Both editions feature a new 4K restoration, headed by Lee Kline, technical director of the Criterion Collection, and supervised by one of the film's cinematographers, Shoji Ueda. Also included in the release is an on-set making-of documentary directed by Nobuhiko Obayashi called Making of \"Dreams\", which was filmed during its production, and Catherine Cadou's 2011 French documentary Kurosawa's Way. The Criterion edition was released in 4K Blu-ray with HDR in August 2023.\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nKurosawa, Akira (1983). Something Like an Autobiography. Vintage Books.

It is notable for being the first of sixteen film collaborations between director Kurosawa and actor Toshiro Mifune.\n\nPlot\nSanada (Takashi Shimura) is an alcoholic doctor (the titular \"drunken angel\") in postwar Japan who treats a small-time yakuza named Matsunaga (Toshiro Mifune) after a gunfight with a rival syndicate. The doctor, noticing that Matsunaga is coughing, diagnoses the young gangster with tuberculosis. After frequently pestering Matsunaga, who refuses to deal with his illness, about the need to start taking care of himself, the gangster finally agrees to quit boozing and womanizing and allow Sanada to care for him. The two enjoy an uneasy friendship until Matsunaga's sworn brother, Okada, who is also the abusive ex-boyfriend of the doctor's female assistant Miyo, is released from prison. In the meantime, Sanada continues treating his other patients, one of whom, a young female student, seems to be making progress against her tuberculosis.\nMatsunaga quickly succumbs to peer pressure and stops following the doctor's advice, slipping back into old drinking habits and going to nightclubs with Okada and his fellow yakuza. Eventually, he collapses during a heated dice game and is taken to Sanada's clinic for the evening. Okada shows up and threatens to kill the doctor if he doesn't tell him where to find Miyo, and while Matsunaga stands up for the doctor and gets Okada to leave, he realizes that his sworn brother cannot be trusted. Matsunaga then finds out that the boss of his syndicate, who gave him control of Okada's territory during his time in prison, intends to sacrifice him as a pawn in the war against the rival syndicate. Okada also orders the storeowners in his territory to refuse service to Matsunaga as retaliation for challenging him.\nSanada goes to report Okada's harassment to the police, while Matsunaga discreetly leaves the clinic and goes to the yakuza's apartment. There, he finds his sworn brother with Nanae, Matsunaga's former sweetheart who abandoned him due to his failing health, and angrily tries to stab him before starting to cough up blood. Okada then stabs him in the chest, and Matsunaga stumbles outside before dying of his wounds. Okada is arrested for the murder, but Matsunaga's boss refuses to pay for his funeral. A local barmaid, who had feelings for Matsunaga, pays for it instead and tells Sanada that she plans to take Matsunaga's ashes to be buried on her father's ranch, where she had offered to live with him. The doctor retorts that while he understands how she feels, he cannot forgive Matsunaga for throwing his life away. Just then, his patient, the female student, arrives and reveals that her tuberculosis is cured and the doctor happily leads her to the market for a celebratory sweet.\n\nCast\nProduction\nWhile looking for an actor to play Matsunaga, Kurosawa was told by one of the casting directors about Mifune, who was auditioning for another movie where he had to play an angry character. Kurosawa watched Mifune do this audition, and was so amazed by Mifune that he cast him as Matsunaga. On the film's Criterion Collection DVD, Japanese-film scholar Donald Richie comments that Kurosawa was impressed by the athletic agility and \"cat-like\" moves of Mifune, which also had bearing in his casting.\nCensorship issues in Drunken Angel are covered extensively in a supplemental documentary by Danish film scholar Lars-Martin Sorensen, created for the Criterion Collection DVD release of the film, entitled Kurosawa and the Censors. Produced and released during the American occupation in Japan, the Drunken Angel screenplay had to comply with a censorship board issued by the U.S. government. The board did not allow criticism of the occupation to be shown in Japanese films at that time. \nKurosawa slipped several references to the occupation, all of them negative, past the censors. The opening scene of the film features unlicensed prostitutes known as \"pan pan\" girls, who catered to American soldiers. The gangsters and their girlfriends all wear Westernized clothing and hairstyles. Kurosawa was not allowed to show a burned-out building in his black-market slum set, but he did heavily feature the poisonous bog at the center of the district. English-language signage was also not allowed, but the markets on set have several examples of English usage on their signs. The dance scene in the nightclub features an original composition (\"Jungle Boogie\", sung by Shizuko Kasagi) with lyrics by Kurosawa, satirizing American jazz music; Kasagi imitates Johnny Weissmuller's famous yell from the Tarzan movies, and the way Kurosawa frames the singer parodies the American film noir movie Gilda. The censorship board was unable to catch these subtle breaches due to overwork and understaffing, but censors did require Kurosawa to rewrite the film's original, more \"gruesome\" ending.\nThe film was made in the context of a series of labor disputes with the Toho company. After the film's completion the strikes escalated and Kurosawa, disillusioned by studio executives' attitudes to the union, and the state of siege the occupying strikers were placed under by police and the American military, left Toho. In his memoir Kurosawa writes that the studio \"I had thought was my home actually belonged to strangers\".\n\nMusic\nKurosawa used music to provide contrast with the content of a given scene. In particular was his use of The Cuckoo Waltz by J. E. Jonasson. During filming, Kurosawa's father died. While he was in a sad state, he heard The Cuckoo Waltz playing in the background, and the whimsical music made him even more depressed.\nKurosawa decided to use this same effect in the film, at the low point in the life of Matsunaga, when the character realizes that he was being used all along by the crime boss Okada. Kurosawa had the sound crew find the exact recording of The Cuckoo Waltz that he had heard after his father died, and had them play the instrumental beginning of the song repeatedly for the scene in which Matsunaga walks down the street after leaving the crime boss. Kurosawa also wanted to use, in the opening scene for Okada, to have him perform on guitar \"Mack the Knife\", originally \"Die Moritat von Mackie Messer\" which was a song composed by Kurt Weill with lyrics by Bertolt Brecht for their music drama Die Dreigroschenoper, but the studio could not afford the rights to the song.\n\nThemes\nStephen Prince in his analysis of Kurosawa's filmography considers the \"double loss of identity\" present within the film. One loss implying a reformation of social identity whereby the progressive individual should separate themselves from the family (embodied in the yakuza), and the other being symptomatic of a \"national schizophrenia\" that has resulted from the Americanization of Japan. In the film the young are cut off from the past but still bound by its social mores. Prince writes that the narrative and spatial confinement of much of the film close to the sump returns the action to sickness, posing the question of how recovery can emerge from a humane ethic under post-war conditions.\n\nRelease\nTheatrical\nDrunken Angel was released in Japanese cinemas on April 27 1948.\n\nReception\nCritical response\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Drunken Angel has a 93% approval rating.\nWriting in 1959 for the New York Times, Bosley Crowther cites the film's developing \"brooding and brutish mood\" and \"poisonous atmosphere\" in his positive appraisal of its symbolic moral conflict. He also gives a positive account of the acting and Kurosawa's \"forceful imagery\", despite criticizing some of the film's \"derivative techniques\" and clich\u00e9s.\n\nLegacy\nDrunken Angel is often considered Kurosawa's first major work. The director later reflected on the film's structural weakness which he mostly attributed to Mifune's intense screen-presence, one which overshadowed Shimura's role as the moral center of the film. \nIn The Yakuza Movie Book: A Guide to Japanese Gangster Films (2003), Mark Schilling cited the film as the first to depict post-war yakuza, although he noted the movie tends to play off the yakuza film genre's common themes rather than depict them straightforwardly.\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\nMovie sources\nDrunken Angel - Japanese With English Subtitles, online video (1 hour, 38 minutes, 14 seconds), at Archive.org\n\nReviews\nDrunken Angel at IMDb\nDrunken Angel at AllMovie\nDrunken Angel at the Japanese Movie Database (in Japanese)\nDVD Review: BFI - Region 2 - PAL\nEssay by Jay Carr at Turner Classic Movies\n\nCommentary\nDrunken Angel: The Spoils of War an essay by Ian Buruma at the Criterion Collection","57":"Early Summer (\u9ea5\u79cb, Bakush\u016b, Lit. \"Barley Harvest Time\") is a 1951 Japanese drama by Yasujir\u014d Ozu. Like most of Ozu's post-war films, Early Summer deals with issues ranging from communication problems between generations to the rising role of women in post-war Japan. The plot concerns Noriko, who lives contentedly in an extended family household that includes her parents and her brother's family, but an uncle's visit prompts the family to find her a husband.\n\nPlot\nNoriko, a secretary in Tokyo, lives in Kamakura, Kanagawa with her extended Mamiya family, which includes her parents Sh\u016bkichi and Shige, her older brother K\u014dichi, a physician, his wife Fumiko, and their two young sons Minoru and Isamu.\nAn elderly uncle arrives and reminds everyone that Noriko, who is 28, should marry. At work, Noriko's boss Satake recommends a match for her with a forty-year-old friend of his, Mr. Manabe, a businessman and golfer. Noriko's friends are divided into two groups\u2014the married and the unmarried\u2014who tease one another endlessly, with Aya Tamura being her close ally in the unmarried group. Noriko's family gently pressures Noriko into accepting the match proposed by Satake, agreeing that it is time for her to marry and believing that the match proposed is a good one for someone her age.\nChildhood friend Kenkichi Yabe, a doctor, widower, and father to a young daughter, arranges to have tea with Noriko and gives her a sheaf of wheat. The sheaf is a gift from a brother who was killed during World War II and who had asked Yabe to deliver it to Noriko in case he did not return. Later, Yabe is posted to Akita, in northern Honshu. Akita is considered so rural that Noriko and Aya make fun of the area's accent. However, when Yabe's mother Tami impulsively asks Noriko to marry Yabe and follow them in their northward resettlement, Noriko agrees. When Noriko reveals her decision, her family is quietly devastated. They hint to her that the match is a poor one. When Noriko persists, the family is forced to live with their disappointment.\nThe family gradually accepts Noriko's choice with quiet resignation, and before she moves on, the family takes a photograph together. Noriko's parents console themselves that Noriko and Kenkichi will move back to Tokyo in a few years' time, reuniting the family. Meanwhile, the parents move to a rural region to stay with Noriko's elderly uncle. In the final scene, Noriko's parents watch a bride pass down the country road in her traditional costume. The final shot is of a barley field ripening around.\n\nCast\nReception\nEarly Summer is highly regarded by today's critics. Rotten Tomatoes reports 100% approval among 11 critics, with an average rating of 8.90\/10. Aggregation site They Shoot Pictures, Don't They has found it to be one of the 1,000 most acclaimed films in history. In 2009, the film was ranked at No. 106 on the list of the Greatest Japanese Films of All Time by Japanese film magazine Kinema Junpo.\n\nHome media\nIn 2004, the Criterion Collection released a new, higher-definition digital transfer, with restored image and sound and new English subtitle translation. Also included were the original theatrical trailer, an audio commentary by Donald Richie, Ozu\u2019s Films from Behind-the-Scenes, a conversation about Ozu and his working methods between child actor and sound technician Kojir\u014d Suematsu, assistant cameraman Takashi Kawamata, and Ozu producer Shizuo Yamanouchi, and essays by David Bordwell and Jim Jarmusch.\nIn 2010, the BFI released a Region 2 Dual Format Edition (Blu-ray + DVD), this time in proper high definition.

It was chosen as the Best Film at the Japan Academy Prize ceremony.\n\nPlot\nGinshiro Kuraoka, an actor for Toei, becomes jealous of the number of close-ups his co-star Tachibana is getting as they are filming a samurai film. After a fan named Tomoko has Ginshiro sign her inner thigh, Ginshiro sends his lackey Yasu Muraoka after her to obtain her phone number.\nGinshiro drowns his sorrows in alcohol, then Yasu brings him home, where the actress Konatsu is waiting for him. Konatsu is pregnant with Ginshiro's child and is unwilling to get an abortion for fear that she may not have another chance to have a child, so Ginshiro convinces Yasu to marry her. Yasu stamps the marriage certificate but Konatsu is disgusted with him for letting Ginshiro walk all over him. Yasu reveals a poster on his wall of her first film and says that he has been a fan for ten years. She tries to leave but collapses from toxemia. Yasu tells the doctors that he is the father of the unborn child.\nYasu begins taking on multiple stunt roles to pay for the expenses and sustains multiple injuries. When Tomoko seems like she might leave him, Ginshiro asks Konatsu to tell her how wonderful he is, which she does. Konatsu and Yasu find happiness but Tomoko does not take care of Ginshiro the way that Konatsu used to so he proposes to Konatsu with a 30-million-yen four-carat ring that he sold his house to buy. When she rejects him, he drives off set. Konatsu and Yasu get married.\nWhen Ginshiro does not show up to film his scenes, Yasu finds him hiding in a warehouse. Ginshiro confesses that Tachibana took his place as the January model for a new model, that the film he was to shoot in the summer has been cancelled, and that he and Tomoko have broken up. Tachibana is gaining more screen time while Ginshiro's character is being killed off and his scenes are being cut, including his final fight scene on a giant 30-foot staircase because no stunt performer can be found who is willing to take the fall down it.\nYasu volunteers to take the fall down the staircase. He receives one million yen in hazard pay after signing a release to free the studio from liability, then takes out a 30-million-yen life insurance policy on himself. Konatsu asks him not to perform the stunt but he insists on it. After Yasu leaves to perform the stunt, Konatsu packs her things and leaves. Studio executives and theater owners visit to watch the stunt, so Yasu places a nail on the stairs and steps on it to see how everyone caters to him. When he demands that his cigarette must be lit by an expensive lighter, Ginshiro uses an expensive one to light it before slapping Yasu. Yasu thanks him profusely and says that he will work on his performance, so he postpones the stunt until after dinner. Yasu performs the stunt and is seriously injured but uses his remaining strength to crawl up the stairs again for a memorable death scene as Ginshiro cheers him on. Konatsu arrives in time to see the ambulance taking Yasu away.\nKonatsu gives birth, then opens her eyes to see Yasu holding the baby. They agree to stay together as a family, then the director yells \"Cut!\" and the walls are pulled away to reveal the cast and crew of the film.\n\nCast\nKeiko Matsuzaka as Konatsu\nMorio Kazama as Ginshiro\nMitsuru Hirata as Yasu\nChika Takami as Tomoko\nDaijiro Harada as Tachibana\nKeizo Kanie as Film Director\nRei Okamoto as Toku-san\nHyoei Enoki as Tome\nNagare Hagiwara as Yuji\nToshiya Sakai as Makoto\nAkihiro Shimizu\nNijiko Kiyokawa as Yasu's mother\nSonny Chiba as himself\nHiroyuki Sanada as himself\nEtsuko Shihomi as herself\nSeizo Fukumoto\nAkira Shioji as Yamada\n\nAwards\n4th Yokohama Film Festival \n\nWon: Best Supporting Actor - Mitsuru Hirata\n2nd Best Film\n\nSong\n\"Kamata koshin-kyoku\" is the title of a cover version of \"Song of the Vagabonds\" from the 1929 operetta The Vagabond King by Rudolph Friml.

The legacy of influence has ranged from working methods, influence on style, and selection and adaptation of themes in cinema. Kurosawa's working method was oriented toward extensive involvement with numerous aspects of film production. He was also an effective screenwriter who would work in close contact with his writers very early in the production cycle to ensure high quality in the scripts which would be used for his films. \nKurosawa's aesthetic visual sense meant that his attention to cinematography and filming was also demanding and often went beyond the attention which directors would normally expect to use with their cameramen. His reputation as an editor of his own films was consistent throughout his lifetime in his insisting on close participation with any other editors involved in the editing of his films. Throughout his career, Kurosawa worked constantly with people drawn from the same pool of creative technicians, crew members and actors, popularly known as the \"Kurosawa-gumi\" (Japanese: \u9ed2\u6fa4\u7d44, 'Kurosawa group').\nThe style associated with Kurosawa's films is marked by a number of innovations which Kurosawa introduced in his films over the decades. In his films of the 1940s and 1950s, Kurosawa introduced innovative uses of the axial cut and the screen wipe which became part of the standard repertoire of filmmaking for subsequent generations of filmmakers. Kurosawa, and his emphasis on sound-image counterpoint, by all accounts always gave great attention to the soundtracks of his films and he was involved with several of Japan's outstanding composers of his generation including Toru Takemitsu.\nThere are four themes which can be associated with Kurosawa's filmmaking technique which recur from his early films to the films he made at the end of his career. These include his interest in (a) the master-disciple relationship, (b) the heroic champion, (c) the close examination of nature and human nature, and (d) the cycles of violence. Regarding Kurosawa's reflections on the theme of cycles of violence, these found a beginning with Throne of Blood (1957), and became nearly an obsession with historical cycles of inexorable savage violence\u2014what Stephen Prince calls \"the countertradition to the committed, heroic mode of Kurosawa's cinema\" which Kurosawa would sustain as a thematic interest even toward the end of his career in his last films.\n\nWorking methods\nAll biographical sources, as well as the filmmaker's own comments, indicate that Akira Kurosawa was a completely \"hands-on\" director, passionately involved in every aspect of the filmmaking process. As one interviewer summarized, \"he (co-)writes his scripts, oversees the design, rehearses the actors, sets up all the shots and then does the editing.\" His active participation extended from the initial concept to the editing and scoring of the final product.\n\nScript\nKurosawa emphasized time and again that the screenplay was the absolute foundation of a successful film and that, though a mediocre director can sometimes make a passable film out of a good script, even an excellent director can never make a good film out of a bad script. During the postwar period, he began the practice of collaborating with a rotating group of five screenwriters: Eijir\u014d Hisaita, Ryuzo Kikushima, Shinobu Hashimoto, Hideo Oguni, and Masato Ide. Whichever members of this group happened to be working on a particular film would gather around a table, often at a hot-springs resort, where they would not be distracted by the outside world. (Seven Samurai, for example, was written in this fashion.) Often they all (except Oguni, who acted as \"referee\") would work on exactly the same pages of the script, and Kurosawa would choose the best-written version from the different drafts of each particular scene. This method was adopted \"so that each contributor might function as a kind of foil, checking the dominance of any one person's point-of-view.\"\nIn addition to the actual script, Kurosawa at this stage often produced extensive, fantastically detailed notes to elaborate his vision. For example, for Seven Samurai, he created six notebooks with (among many other things) detailed biographies of the samurai, including what they wore and ate, how they walked, talked and behaved when greeted, and even how each tied his shoes. For the 101 peasant characters in the film, he created a registry consisting of 23 families and instructed the performers playing these roles to live and work as these \"families\" for the duration of shooting.\n\nShooting\nFor his early films, although they were consistently well photographed, Kurosawa generally used standard lenses and deep-focus photography. Beginning with Seven Samurai (1954), however, Kurosawa's cinematic technique changed drastically with his extensive use of long lens and multiple cameras. The director claimed that he used these lenses and several cameras rolling at once to help the actors\u2014allowing them to be photographed at some distance from the lens, and without any knowledge of which particular camera's image would be utilized in the final cut\u2014making their performances much more natural. (In fact, Tatsuya Nakadai agreed that the multiple cameras greatly helped his performances with the director.) But these changes had a powerful effect as well on the look of the action scenes in that film, particularly the final battle in the rain. Says Stephen Prince: \"He can use the telephoto lenses to get under the horses, in between their hooves, to plunge us into the chaos of that battle in a visual way that is really quite unprecedented, both in Kurosawa's own work and in the samurai genre as a whole.\"\n\nWith The Hidden Fortress (1958), Kurosawa began to utilize the widescreen (anamorphic) process for the first time in his work. These three techniques\u2014long lenses, multiple cameras and widescreen\u2014were in later works fully exploited, even in sequences with little or no overt action, such as the early scenes of High and Low that take place in the central character's home, in which they are employed to dramatize tensions and power relationships between the characters within a highly confined space.\nFor Throne of Blood (1957), in the scene where Washizu (Toshiro Mifune) is attacked with arrows by his own men, the director had archers shoot real arrows, hollowed out and running along wires, toward Mifune from a distance of about ten feet, with the actor carefully following chalk marks on the ground to avoid being hit. (Some of the arrows missed him by an inch; the actor, who admitted that he was not merely acting terrified in the film, suffered nightmares afterward.)\nFor Red Beard (1965), to construct the gate for the clinic set, Kurosawa had his assistants dismantle rotten wood from old sets and then create the prop from scratch with this old wood, so the gate would look properly ravaged by time. For the same film, for teacups that appeared in the movie, his crew poured fifty years' worth of tea into the cups so they would appear appropriately stained.\nFor Ran (1985), art director Yoshir\u014d Muraki, constructing the \"third castle\" set under the director's supervision, created the \"stones\" of that castle by having photographs taken of actual stones from a celebrated castle, then painting Styrofoam blocks to exactly resemble those stones and gluing them to the castle \"wall\" through a process known as \"rough-stone piling\", which required months of work. Later, before shooting the famous scene in which the castle is attacked and set on fire, in order to prevent the Styrofoam \"stones\" from melting in the heat, the art department coated the surface with four layers of cement, then painted the colors of the ancient stones onto the cement.\n\nEditing\nKurosawa both directed and edited most of his films, which is nearly unique among prominent filmmakers. Kurosawa often remarked that he shot a film simply in order to have material to edit, because the editing of a picture was the most important and creatively interesting part of the process for him. Kurosawa's creative team believed that the director's skill with editing was his greatest talent. Hiroshi Nezu, a longtime production supervisor on his films, said, \"Among ourselves, we think that he is Toho's best director, that he is Japan's best scenarist, and that he is the best editor in the world. He is most concerned with the flowing quality which a film must have ... The Kurosawa film flows over the cut, as it were.\"\nThe director's frequent crew member Teruyo Nogami confirms this view. \"Akira Kurosawa's editing was exceptional, the inimitable work of a genius ... No one was a match for him.\" She claimed that Kurosawa carried in his head all the information about all shots filmed, and if, in the editing room, he asked for a piece of film and she handed him the wrong one, he would immediately recognize the error, though she had taken detailed notes on each shot and he had not. She compared his mind to a computer, which could do with edited segments of film what computers do today.\nKurosawa's habitual method was to edit a film daily, bit by bit, during production. This helped particularly when he started using multiple cameras, which resulted in a large amount of film to assemble. \"I always edit in the evening if we have a fair amount of footage in the can. After watching the rushes, I usually go to the editing room and work.\" Because of this practice of editing as he went along, the post-production period for a Kurosawa film could be startlingly brief: Yojimbo (1961) had its Japanese premiere on April 20, 1961, four days after shooting concluded on April 16.\n\n\"Kurosawa-gumi\"\nThroughout his career, Kurosawa worked constantly with people drawn from the same pool of creative technicians, crew members and actors, popularly known as the \"Kurosawa-gumi\" (Kurosawa group). The following is a partial list of this group, divided by profession. This information is derived from the IMDb pages for Kurosawa's films and Stuart Galbraith IV's filmography:\nComposers: Fumio Hayasaka (Drunken Angel, Stray Dog, Scandal, Rashomon, The Idiot, Ikiru, Seven Samurai, I Live in Fear); Masaru Sato (Throne of Blood, The Lower Depths, The Hidden Fortress, The Bad Sleep Well, Yojimbo, Sanjuro, High and Low, Red Beard); T\u014dru Takemitsu (Dodeskaden, Ran); Shin'ichir\u014d Ikebe (Kagemusha, Dreams, Rhapsody in August, Madadayo).\nCinematographers: Asakazu Nakai (No Regrets for Our Youth, One Wonderful Sunday, Stray Dog, Ikiru, Seven Samurai, I Live in Fear, Throne of Blood, High and Low, Red Beard, Dersu Uzala, Ran); Kazuo Miyagawa (Rashomon, Yojimbo); Kazuo Yamazaki (The Lower Depths, The Hidden Fortress); Takao Saito (Sanjuro, High and Low, Red Beard, Dodeskaden, Kagemusha, Ran, Dreams, Rhapsody in August, Madadayo).\nArt Department: Yoshir\u014d Muraki served as either assistant art director, art director or production designer for all Kurosawa's films (except for Dersu Uzala) from Drunken Angel until the end of the director's career. The 1,400 uniforms and suits of armor used for the extras in the film Ran were designed by costume designer Emi Wada and Kurosawa, and were handmade by master tailors over more than two years, for which the film won its sole Academy Award.\nProduction Crew: Teruyo Nogami served as script supervisor, production manager, associate director or assistant to the producer on all of Kurosawa's films from Rashomon (1950) to the end of the director's career. Hiroshi Nezu was production supervisor or unit production manager on all the films from Seven Samurai to Dodeskaden, except Sanjuro. After retiring as a director, Ishir\u014d Honda returned more than 30 years later to work again for his friend and former mentor as a directorial advisor, production coordinator and creative consultant on Kurosawa's last five films (Kagemusha, Ran, Dreams, Rhapsody in August and Madadayo).\nActors: Leading actors: Takashi Shimura (21 films); Toshiro Mifune (16 films), Susumu Fujita (8 films), Tatsuya Nakadai (6 films) and Masayuki Mori (5 films).\nSupporting performers (in alphabetical order): Minoru Chiaki, Kamatari Fujiwara, Bokuzen Hidari, Fumiko Homma, Hisashi Igawa, Yunosuke Ito, Ky\u014dko Kagawa, Daisuke Kat\u014d, Isao Kimura, Kokuten Kodo, Akitake Kono, Yoshio Kosugi, Koji Mitsui, Seiji Miyaguchi, Eiko Miyoshi, Nobuo Nakamura, Akemi Negishi, Denjiro Okochi, Noriko Sengoku, Gen Shimizu, Ichiro Sugai, Haruo Tanaka, Akira Terao, Eijir\u014d T\u014dno, Yoshio Tsuchiya, Kichijiro Ueda, Atsushi Watanabe, Isuzu Yamada, Tsutomu Yamazaki and Yoshitaka Zushi.\n\nStyle\nVirtually all commentators have noted Kurosawa's bold, dynamic style, which many have compared to the traditional Hollywood style of narrative moviemaking, one that emphasizes, in the words of one such scholar, \"chronological, causal, linear and historical thinking\". But it has also been claimed that, from his very first film, the director displayed a technique quite distinct from the seamless style of classic Hollywood. This technique involved a disruptive depiction of screen space through the use of numerous unrepeated camera setups, a disregard for the traditional 180-degree axis of action around which Hollywood scenes have usually been constructed, and an approach in which \"narrative time becomes spatialized\", with fluid camera movement often replacing conventional editing. The following are some idiosyncratic aspects of the artist's style.\n\nAxial cut\nIn his films of the 1940s and 1950s, Kurosawa frequently employs the \"axial cut\", in which the camera moves closer to, or further away from, the subject, not through the use of tracking shots or dissolves, but through a series of matched jump cuts. For example, in Sanshiro Sugata Part II (1945), the hero takes leave of the woman he loves, but then, after walking away a short distance, turns and bows to her, and then, after walking further, turns and bows once more. This sequence of shots is illustrated on film scholar David Bordwell's blog. The three shots are not connected in the film by camera movements or dissolves, but by a series of two jump cuts. The effect is to stress the duration of Sanshiro's departure.\nIn the opening sequence of Seven Samurai in the peasant village, the axial cut is used twice. When the villagers are outdoors, gathered in a circle, weeping and lamenting the imminent arrival of the bandits, they are glimpsed from above in extreme long shot, then, after the cut, in a much closer shot, then in an even closer shot at ground level as the dialogue begins. A few minutes later, when the villagers go to the mill to ask the village elder's advice, there is a long shot of the mill, with a slowly turning wheel in the river, then a closer shot of this wheel, and then a still closer shot of it. (As the mill is where the elder lives, these shots forge a mental association in the viewer's mind between that character and the mill.)\n\nCutting on motion\nA number of scholars have pointed out Kurosawa's tendency to \"cut on motion\": that is, to edit a sequence of a character or characters in motion so that an action is depicted in two or more separate shots, rather than one uninterrupted shot. One scholar, as an example, describes a tense scene in Seven Samurai in which the samurai Shichir\u014dji, who is standing, wishes to console the peasant Manzo, who is sitting on the ground, and he gets down on one knee to talk to him. Kurosawa chooses to film this simple action in two shots rather than one (cutting between the two only after the action of kneeling has begun) to fully convey Shichir\u014dji's humility. Numerous other instances of this device are evident in the movie. \"Kurosawa [frequently] breaks up the action, fragments it, in order to create an emotional effect.\"\n\nWipe\nA form of cinematic punctuation very strongly identified with Kurosawa is the wipe. This is an effect created through an optical printer, in which, when a scene ends, a line or bar appears to move across the screen, \"wiping\" away the image while simultaneously revealing the first image of the subsequent scene. As a transitional device, it is used as a substitute for the straight cut or the dissolve (though Kurosawa, of course, often used both of those devices as well). In his mature work, Kurosawa employed the wipe so frequently that it became a kind of signature. For example, one blogger has counted no fewer than 12 instances of the wipe in Drunken Angel (1948).\nThere are a number of theories concerning the purpose of this device, which, as James Goodwin notes, was common in silent cinema but became considerably rarer in the more \"realistic\" sound cinema. Goodwin claims that the wipes in Rashomon, for instance, fulfill one of three purposes: emphasizing motion in traveling shots, marking narrative shifts in the courtyard scenes and marking temporal ellipses between actions (e.g., between the end of one character's testimony and the beginning of another's). He also points out that in The Lower Depths (1957), in which Kurosawa completely avoided the use of wipes, the director cleverly manipulated people and props \"in order to slide new visual images in and out of view much as a wipe cut does\".\nAn instance of the wipe used as a satirical device can be seen in Ikiru (1952). A group of women visit the local government office to petition the bureaucrats to turn a waste area into a children's playground. The viewer is then shown a series of point of view shots of various bureaucrats, connected by wipe transitions, each of whom refers the group to another department. Nora Tennessen comments in her blog (which shows one example) that \"the wipe technique makes [the sequence] funnier\u2014images of bureaucrats are stacked like cards, each more punctilious than the last.\"\n\nImage-sound counterpoint\nKurosawa by all accounts always gave great attention to the soundtracks of his films (Teruyo Nogami's memoir gives many such examples). In the late 1940s, he began to employ music for what he called \"counterpoint\" to the emotional content of a scene, rather than merely to reinforce the emotion, as Hollywood traditionally did (and still does). The inspiration for this innovation came from a family tragedy. When news reached Kurosawa of his father's death in 1948, he wandered aimlessly through the streets of Tokyo. His sorrow was magnified rather than diminished when he suddenly heard the cheerful, vapid song \"The Cuckoo Waltz\", and he hurried to escape from this \"awful music\". He then told his composer, Fumio Hayasaka, with whom he was working on Drunken Angel, to use \"The Cuckoo Waltz\" as ironic accompaniment to the scene in which the dying gangster, Matsunaga, sinks to his lowest point in the narrative.\nThis approach to music can also be found in Stray Dog (1949), a film released a year after Drunken Angel. In the climactic scene, the detective Murakami is fighting furiously with the murderer Yusa in a muddy field. The sound of a Mozart piece is suddenly heard, played on the piano by a woman in a nearby house. As one commentator notes, \"In contrast to this scene of primitive violence, the serenity of the Mozart is, literally, other-worldly\" and \"the power of this elemental encounter is heightened by the music.\" Nor was Kurosawa's \"ironic\" use of the soundtrack limited to music. One critic observes that, in Seven Samurai, \"During episodes of murder and mayhem, birds chirp in the background, as they do in the first scene when the farmers lament their seemingly hopeless fate.\"\n\nRecurring themes\nMaster\u2013disciple relationship\nMany commentators have noted the frequent occurrence in Kurosawa's work of the complex relationship between an older and a younger man, who serve each other as master and disciple, respectively. This theme was clearly an expression of the director's life experience. \"Kurosawa revered his teachers, in particular Kajiro Yamamoto, his mentor at Toho\", according to Joan Mellen. \"The salutary image of an older person instructing the young evokes always in Kurosawa's films high moments of pathos.\" The critic Tadao Sato considers the recurring character of the \"master\" to be a type of surrogate father, whose role it is to witness the young protagonist's moral growth and approve of it.\nIn his very first film, Sanshiro Sugata (1943), after the judo master Yano becomes the title character's teacher and spiritual guide, \"the narrative [is] cast in the form of a chronicle studying the stages of the hero's growing mastery and maturity.\" The master-pupil relationship in the films of the postwar era\u2014as depicted in such works as Drunken Angel, Stray Dog, Seven Samurai, Red Beard and Dersu Uzala\u2014involves very little direct instruction, but much learning through experience and example; Stephen Prince relates this tendency to the private and nonverbal nature of the concept of Zen enlightenment.\nBy the time of Kagemusha (1980), however, according to Prince, the meaning of this relationship has changed. A thief chosen to act as the double of a great lord continues his impersonation even after his master's death: \"the relationship has become spectral and is generated from beyond the grave with the master maintaining a ghostly presence. Its end is death, not the renewal of commitment to the living that typified its outcome in earlier films.\" However, according to the director's biographer, in his final film, 1993's Madadayo\u2014which deals with a teacher and his relationship with an entire group of ex-pupils\u2014a sunnier vision of the theme emerges: \"The students hold an annual party for their professor, attended by dozens of former students, now adults of varying age ... This extended sequence ... expresses, as only Kurosawa can, the simple joys of student-teacher relationships, of kinship, of being alive.\"\n\nHeroic champion\nKurosawa's is a heroic cinema, a series of dramas (mostly) concerned with the deeds and fates of larger-than-life heroes. Stephen Prince has identified the emergence of the unique Kurosawa protagonist with the immediate post-World War II period. The goal of the American Occupation to replace Japanese feudalism with individualism coincided with the director's artistic and social agenda: \"Kurosawa welcomed the changed political climate and sought to fashion his own mature cinematic voice.\" The Japanese critic Tadao Sato concurs: \"With defeat in World War II, many Japanese ... were dumbfounded to find that the government had lied to them and was neither just nor dependable. During this uncertain time Akira Kurosawa, in a series of first-rate films, sustained the people by his consistent assertion that the meaning of life is not dictated by the nation but something each individual should discover for himself through suffering.\" The filmmaker himself remarked that, during this period, \"I felt that without the establishment of the self as a positive value there could be no freedom and no democracy.\"\nThe first such postwar hero was, atypically for the artist, a heroine\u2014Yukie, played by Setsuko Hara, in No Regrets for Our Youth (1946). According to Prince, her \"desertion of family and class background to assist a poor village, her perseverance in the face of enormous obstacles, her assumption of responsibility for her own life and for the well-being of others, and her existential loneliness ... are essential to Kurosawan heroism and make of Yukie the first coherent ... example.\" This \"existential loneliness\" is also exemplified by Dr. Sanada (Takashi Shimura) in Drunken Angel: \"Kurosawa insists that his heroes take their stand, alone, against tradition and battle for a better world, even if the path there is not clear. Separation from a corrupt social system in order to alleviate human suffering, as Sanada does, is the only honorable course.\"\nMany commentators regard Seven Samurai as the ultimate expression of the artist's heroic ideal. Joan Mellen's comments are typical of this view: \"Seven Samurai is above all a homage to the samurai class at its most noble ... Samurai for Kurosawa represent the best of Japanese tradition and integrity.\" It is because of, not in spite of, the chaotic times of civil war depicted in the film that the seven rise to greatness. \"Kurosawa locates the unexpected benefits no less than the tragedy of this historical moment. The upheaval forces samurai to channel the selflessness of their credo of loyal service into working for peasants.\" However, this heroism is futile because \"there was already rising ... a merchant class which would supplant the warrior aristocracy.\" So the courage and supreme skill of the central characters will not prevent the ultimate destruction of themselves or their class.\nAs Kurosawa's career progressed he seemed to find it increasingly difficult to sustain the heroic ideal. As Prince notes, \"Kurosawa's is an essentially tragic vision of life, and this sensibility ... impedes his efforts to realize a socially committed mode of filmmaking.\" Furthermore, the director's ideal of heroism is subverted by history itself: \"When history is articulated as it is in Throne of Blood, as a blind force ... heroism ceases to be a problem or a reality.\" According to Prince, the filmmaker's vision eventually became so bleak that he would come to view history merely as eternally recurring patterns of violence, within which the individual is depicted as not only unheroic, but utterly helpless (see \"Cycles of violence\" below).\n\nNature and weather\nNature is a crucial element in Kurosawa's films. According to Stephen Prince, \"Kurosawa's sensibility, like that of many Japanese artists, is keenly sensitive to the subtleties and beauties of season and scenery.\" He has never hesitated to exploit climate and weather as plot elements, to the point where they become \"active participants in the drama ... The oppressive heat in Stray Dog and I Live in Fear is omnipresent and becomes thematized as a signifier of a world disjointed by economic collapse and the atomic threat.\" The director himself once said, \"I like hot summers, cold winters, heavy rains and snows, and I think most of my pictures show this. I like extremes because I find them most alive.\"\nWind is also a powerful symbol: \"The persistent metaphor of Kurosawa's work is that of wind, the winds of change, of fortune and adversity.\" \"The visually flamboyant [final] battle [of Yojimbo] takes place in the main street, as huge clouds of dust swirl around the combatants ... The winds that stir the dust ... have brought firearms to the town along with the culture of the West, which will end the warrior tradition.\"\nIt is also difficult not to notice the importance of rain to Kurosawa: \"Rain in Kurosawa's films is never treated neutrally. When it occurs ... it is never a drizzle or a light mist but always a frenzied downpour, a driving storm.\" \"The final battle [in Seven Samurai] is a supreme spiritual and physical struggle, and it is fought in a blinding rainstorm, which enables Kurosawa to visualize an ultimate fusion of social groups ... but this climactic vision of classlessness, with typical Kurosawan ambivalence, has become a vision of horror. The battle is a vortex of swirling rain and mud ... The ultimate fusion of social identity emerges as an expression of hellish chaos.\"\n\nCycles of violence\nBeginning with Throne of Blood (1957), an obsession with historical cycles of inexorable savage violence\u2014what Stephen Prince calls \"the countertradition to the committed, heroic mode of Kurosawa's cinema\"\u2014first appears. According to Donald Richie, within the world of that film, \"Cause and effect is the only law. Freedom does not exist.\" and Prince claims that its events \"are inscribed in a cycle of time that infinitely repeats.\" He uses as evidence the fact that Washizu's lord, unlike the kindly King Duncan of Shakespeare's play, had murdered his own lord years before to seize power, and is then murdered in turn by Washizu (the Macbeth character) for the same reason. \"The fated quality to the action of Macbeth ... was transposed by Kurosawa with a sharpened emphasis upon predetermined action and the crushing of human freedom beneath the laws of karma.\"\nPrince claims that Kurosawa's last epics, Kagemusha and particularly Ran, mark a major turning point in the director's vision of the world. In Kagemusha, \"where once [in the world of his films] the individual [hero] could grasp events tightly and demand that they conform to his or her impulses, now the self is but the epiphenomenon of a ruthless and bloody temporal process, ground to dust beneath the weight and force of history.\" The following epic, Ran, is \"a relentless chronicle of base lust for power, betrayal of the father by his sons, and pervasive wars and murders.\" The historical setting of the film is used as \"a commentary on what Kurosawa now perceives as the timelessness of human impulses toward violence and self-destruction.\" \"History has given way to a perception of life as a wheel of endless suffering, ever turning, ever repeating\", which is compared in many instances in the screenplay with hell. \"Kurosawa has found hell to be both the inevitable outcome of human behavior and the appropriate visualization of his own bitterness and disappointment.\"\n\nSee also\nCinematography\nFilmmaking\nCinematographer\n3D film\n\nReferences\nNotes\nCitations\nSources\nFurther reading\nBuchanan, Judith (2005).

It is based on the novel Ukigumo by Japanese writer Fumiko Hayashi, published just before her death in 1951. The film received numerous national awards upon its release and remains one of director Naruse's most acclaimed works.\n\nPlot\nThe film follows Yukiko, a woman who has just been expatriated from French Indochina, where she has been working as a secretary for a forestry project of the Japanese wartime government. In Tokyo, Yukiko seeks out Kengo, one of the engineers of the project, with whom she had an affair and who had promised to divorce his wife Kuniko for her. They renew their affair, but Kengo tells Yukiko he is unable to leave his sickly wife. She becomes the mistress of an American soldier as a means to survive in times of economic restraint. Still, Yukiko can't cut ties with Kengo, although he even starts an affair with a married younger woman, Osei. Pregnant from Kengo, Yukiko has an abortion. She later hears from Kengo that Kuniko has died from illness. Eventually, Yukiko follows Kengo to his new job on Yakushima island, where she dies of her bad health and the humid climate.\n\nCast\nReception\nFilm director Yasujir\u014d Ozu saw Floating Clouds upon its release and called it \"a real masterpiece\" in his journals.\n\nAwards\n1956: Blue Ribbon Awards for Best Film\n1956: Kinema Junpo Award for Best Film, Best Actor (Masayuki Mori), for Best Actress (Hideko Takamine), and for Best Director (Mikio Naruse)\n1956: Mainichi Film Concours for Best Film, for Best Actress (Hideko Takamine), for Best Director (Mikio Naruse), and for Best Sound Recording (Hisashi Shimonaga)\n\nLegacy\nFloating Clouds is Naruse's most popular film in Japan. It ranked number three of the best Japanese film of all time in a poll of 140 Japanese critics and filmmakers conducted by the magazine Kinema Junpo in 1999. Filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited the film as one of his 100 favourites.\nIt was screened at the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive in 1981, at the Museum of Modern Art in 1985, and at the Harvard Film Archive in 2005 as part of their retrospectives on Mikio Naruse, and at the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise in 2012 and 2018.\n\nAnalysis\nAdrian Martin, editor of on-line film journal Rouge,  has remarked upon Naruse's cinema of walking.  Bertrand Tavernier, speaking of Naruse's Sound of the Mountain, described how the director minutely describes each journey and that \"such comings and goings represent uncertain yet reassuring transitions: they are a way of taking stock, of defining a feeling\".  So in Floating Clouds, the walks down streets \"are journeys of the everyday, where time is measured out of footfalls, \u2013 and where even the most melodramatic blow or the most ecstatic moment of pleasure cannot truly take the characters out of the unromantic, unsentimental forward progression of their existences.\"\nFilm scholar Freda Freiberg has remarked on the terrain of the film: \"The frustrations and moroseness of the lovers in Floating Clouds are directly linked to and embedded in the depressed and demoralised social and economic conditions of early post-war Japan; the bombed-out cities, the shortage of food and housing, the ignominy of national defeat and foreign occupation, the economic temptation of prostitution with American military personnel.\"\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\nFloating Clouds at IMDb\nFloating Clouds at Rotten Tomatoes","65":"Fumio Hayasaka (\u65e9\u5742 \u6587\u96c4 Hayasaka Fumio;  August 19, 1914 \u2013 October 15, 1955) was a Japanese composer of classical music and film scores.\n\nEarly life\nHayasaka was born in the city of Sendai on the main Japanese island of Honsh\u016b. In 1918, Hayasaka and his family moved to Sapporo on the northern island of Hokkaid\u014d. In 1933, Hayasaka and Akira Ifukube organized the New Music League, which held a new music festival the year after.\nHayasaka won a number of prizes for his early concert works; in 1935, his piece Futatsu no sanka e no zens\u014dkyoku won first prize in a radio competition, and another concert piece, Kodai no bukyoku, won the 1938 Weingartner Prize.  Other early works include a Nocturne (1936) for piano and the orchestral Ancient Dance (1938).  In 1939, Hayasaka moved to Tokyo to begin a career as film composer.  By early 1940, Hayasaka was seen as \"a major composer for Japanese Cinema\".\n\nPost-War film music\nAfter the war, Hayasaka continued working on films, quickly winning recognition for his abilities.  In 1946, he received the film music award for An Enemy of the People (Minsh\u016b no Teki, 1946) at the first annual Mainichi Film Awards.  The year after, 1947, Hayasaka received the Mainichi film music award for Teinosuke Kinugasa's Actress (Joyu).\nIn the late 1940s, Hayasaka invited his friend Akira Ifukube to write film music with him at Toho Studios. Ifukube's first film score for Toho was for Senkichi Taniguchi's Snow Trail (Ginrei no hate) in 1947.  Toshir\u014d Mifune, who later starred in most of Kurosawa's films, first met Kurosawa at a pre-screening of this movie.\nOn 22 June 1948 a concerto by Fumio Hayasaka was premiered in Tokyo with Hiroshi Kajiwara as soloist on the grand piano and the Toho Symphony Orchestra (today's Tokyo Symphony Orchestra) under Masashi Ueda.\n\nRelationship with Akira Kurosawa\nFumio Hayasaka had a celebrated association with the pre-eminent Japanese director Akira Kurosawa which was short-lived due to Hayasaka's early death. The 1948 film Drunken Angel (Yoidore tenshi) was the first film directed by Akira Kurosawa that Hayasaka composed music for.  The director and composer collaborated to test \"oppositional handling of music and performance\".  Their collaboration turned into a very deep artistic relationship, with Hayasaka contributing ideas to the visual part of the film.  In his autobiography, Kurosawa would say that working with Hayasaka changed his views on how film music should be used; from then on, he viewed music as \"counterpoint\" to the image and not just an \"accompaniment\".  This is also the first film that Kurosawa used Toshiro Mifune as an actor.\nAmong the films Hayasaka scored for Kurosawa are Stray Dog (1949), Rashomon (1950), Ikiru (1952) and Seven Samurai (1954). During the 1950s, Hayasaka also composed the scores for some of the final works of another Japanese director, Kenji Mizoguchi. Hayasaka composed music for Ugetsu (1953), Sansho the Bailiff (1954), and The Crucified Lovers (1954).\nThe 1950 film Rashomon was especially significant for Hayasaka.  This film won the 1951 Golden Lion from the Venice film festival, and is considered the first Japanese film to be widely seen in the West.  In the Japanese film culture, directors normally wanted music that sounded like well-known Western works; Kurosawa specifically had asked Hayasaka to compose music that sounded like Maurice Ravel's Bol\u00e9ro.  Masaru Sat\u014d, then a young composer, was so impressed with the music that he decided to study with Hayasaka.  This film was also related to the atomic scar of the Japanese culture; although the American occupation forces forbade the Japanese media from \"criticizing America's role in the tragedy\" of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Rashomon depicts a historical era of Japan where her cities are in ruin and social chaos abounds.\nHayasaka was continually productive in the years leading up to his death.  In 1950, he founded the Association of Film Music.  The 1953 film Ugetsu, directed by Kenji Mizoguchi, featured a score by Hayasaka; the film won the silver prize at the 1953 Venice Film Festival.  The year after, 1954, Hayasaka did another Mizoguchi film, the jidai-geki Sansho the Bailiff (Sansho dayu).  This film shared the 1954 Silver Lion prize from the Venice Film Festival with Kazan's On the Waterfront, Fellini's La Strada, and Kurosawa's Seven Samurai.\nSeven Samurai, a Kurosawa jidai-geki film, also features music by Hayasaka.  At the time, it was the largest Japanese film production ever.  This film featured strong directorial music choices that are closely related to Western symphonic concert music.  Masaru Sato assisted with the orchestration of Hayasaka's score.  This score utilized the leitmotif, which is a method of compositional organization borrowed from western operas.\nDuring his time in Tokyo, Hayasaka also wrote several notable concert works including Ancient Dances of the Left and on the Right (1941), a Piano Concerto (1948) and the orchestral suite Yukara (1955).\nHayasaka served as a musical mentor to both Masaru Sat\u014d and T\u014dru Takemitsu.\n\nDeath\nIn 1955, Hayasaka died of tuberculosis in Tokyo at the age of 41.  He died while working on the score for I Live in Fear (Record of a Living Being, Ikimono no kiroku), so Masaru Sato completed the score.  The depth of the relationship between Hayasaka and Kurosawa is shown in that this film was based on a conversation between the two friends. Hayasaka was very ill at the time, and pondering the fear of his own death.  Weak and sickly from TB, he told Kurosawa that \"with this illness threatening my life, I can't work.\" Kurosawa was deeply affected by his friend's death and \"fell into a deep depression\".  The film Record of a Living Being combined his depression and the Japanese atomic scar to create a film that illustrates the \"human experience in the atomic age\".\n\nInfluence on other composers\nAkira Ifukube, influenced by Hayasaka to work with films, scored Toho Studio's Godzilla, sealing his fame as a composer of music for Japanese horror films.  This movie was another of a series of postwar films that displayed a Japanese fear of the effects of atomic weapons.\nAfter finishing Hayasaka's score for I Live in Fear, Masuro Sato went on to score seven more films by Kurosawa.  Keeping with Hayasaka's western-orchestral influence, for Kurosawa's 1957 jidai-geki film, Throne of Blood (Kumonosu-jo), Sato composed a score that also borrows from the western composer Verdi.  Sato continued to use demonstrate deep western influences through the rest of his career, making his scores (and the films they accompany) \"especially accessible to non-Oriental listeners\". This was another film of Kurosawa's that indirectly alluded to the atomic bombs, being set in \"a period after cataclysmic destruction to a center of Japanese life and political power\".\nIn his memory, as an homage, T\u014dru Takemitsu wrote his Requiem for strings in 1957.\n\nMusical style\nHayasaka's early musical style was late-Romantic with influences of traditional Japanese music. In the years before his death his style drifted towards atonality and modernism.  Keeping with tradition and the demands of film makers, while scoring for films his music was closely related to (and often borrowed from) western orchestral music.\n\nSelected list of classical works\nOrchestral works\nPrelude for Two Hymns (1936)\nAncient Dance (1938)\nOverture in D (1939)\nAdagio for strings (1940)\nAncient Dances on the Left and on the Right (1941)\nThe Tale of the Tree of Muku (1946)\nPiano Concerto (1948)\nMetamorphosis for orchestra (1953)\nYukara (1955)\n\nChamber\/instrumental works\nKunshi no Iori, for piano (1934)\nNocturne No. 1, for piano (1937)\nPiano Pieces for Chamber (1941)\nFour unaccompanied songs to poems by Haruo Sato for solo soprano (1944)\nRomance, for Piano\nNocturne No. 2, for piano (1947)\nAutumn, for piano (1947)\nString Quartet (1950)\nSuite in Seven Parts (1952)\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nLarson, Randall; Sato, Masaru (Winter 1986 \u2013 Summer 1987).

In 1992, he joined the staff of the Library of America as executive editor, becoming editor-in-chief in 1998.\n\nBiography\nO'Brien was born in New York City and grew up in Great Neck, Long Island. His mother, Margaret O'Brien, n\u00e9e Owens, was a theater actress, and his father was Joseph O'Brien, one of the original WMCA Good Guys.\nO'Brien began publishing poetry and criticism in the 1960s. He has been a contributor to Artforum, Film Comment, The New York Times and The New York Times Book Review, Village Voice, New Republic, Bookforum, and, especially, to the New York Review of Books. He has also been published in numerous other publications, including Filmmaker, American Heritage, The Armchair Detective, Bomb, Boston Globe, Fence, GQ, The Los Angeles Times Book Review, Men\u2019s Vogue, Mother Jones, The Nation, Newsday, and Slate, and has contributed many essays for liner notes for The Criterion Collection. In addition, his work has been included in numerous anthologies.\nHe has served as editor of The Reader's Catalog (1987\u20131991), a faculty member of The Writing Program at The New School, a contributing editor at Open City, and was a member of the selection committee for The New York Film Festival in 2003.\n\nLiterary style\nErudite but playful, O\u2019Brien\u2019s style as an essayist and reviewer is unique. Highly associative in approach, his dense, highbrow prose is often brought to bear upon the worlds of low-budget exploitation films and pulp fiction as well as more upscale and respectable venues of the cinematic, theater, literary, or popular music worlds. These wide-ranging pieces have been described as idiosyncratic \u201cprose poems\u201d  and tend towards partial autobiography in which he recollects youthful experiences as reader or viewer which \u2014 although they may or may not have been shared by his own readership \u2014 can lead deeply into unexpected aspects of the material at hand. Publishers Weekly noted \"O'Brien's remarkable sensitivity\" in Sonata for Jukebox, adding that \"[m]ost striking, however, are the essays in which O'Brien explores the way music defined\u2014and now defines how he remembers\u2014his own formative youthful experiences, from the impact on his musical sensibility of his father, a popular radio disk jockey, to the way the pop music of the 1960s defined how he and his friends lived.\"\nWriting in Bookforum, Robert P. Baird described Early Autumn as a \"book of elegant, often moving poems\" \"writ[ten] so comfortably in the elegiac mode that [O'Brien] sometimes makes us forget poetry was equipped to handle any other.\" Nathaniel Tarn wondered whether O'Brien, in Red Sky Caf\u00e9, \"endows these poems with such a flowing sense of narrative, so that, together with everything else you expect from a poem today, you get such a wonderful and rare gift: a story that you can read as such as if the poem were a novel in micrograms?\" Tarn concluded that \"O\u2019B[rien] is hands down the most elegant poet writing today.\"\n\nAwards and accolades\n1988 Whiting Award\n1994 Finalist, National Book Critics Circle Award (Criticism)\n1998 Fellow, New York Institute for the Humanities\n1999 Fellow, John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation\n2002 Fellow, Rockefeller Foundation, Bellagio Study Center, Italy\n2011 Fellow, Bosch Public Policy Prize, American Academy in Berlin\n\nBooks\nReviews and cultural criticism\nO'Brien, Geoffrey (1981).

The bear is the heraldic animal of Berlin, featured on both the coat of arms and flag of Berlin.\n\nHistory\nThe winners of the first Berlin International Film Festival in 1951 were determined by a West German panel, with five winners of the Golden Bear, divided by categories and genres.\nBetween 1952 and 1955, the winners of the Golden Bear were determined by the audience members.\nIn 1956, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des Associations de Producteurs de Films formally accredited the festival, and since then, the Golden Bear has been awarded by an international jury.\n\nThe award\nThe statuette shows a bear standing on its hind legs and is based on the 1932 design by German sculptor Ren\u00e9e Sintenis of Berlin's heraldic mascot that later became the symbol of the festival. It has been manufactured since either the first or third edition by art foundry Hermann Noack.\nThe original award was redesigned in a larger version in 1960, with the left arm of the bear raised as opposed to the right in the former model.\nAs of 2010, the bear is 20 cm (7.9 in) high and is fixed onto a base where the winning name is engraved.

Lyrics were written by Isamu Yoshii, melody by Shinpei Nakayama. The lyrics of the song are presented as the advice of an experienced individual to younger souls regarding the fleeting nature of youth and the caution against missing the opportunities of youth when they are available and before they have passed with growing age.\n\nLyrics\nMusic\nThe music is written in three quarter time as a melancholy waltz in a major key played to a slow meter. Its structure is written to accompany four poetic stanzas where the first two verses of each stanza serve as a refrain throughout the entire song.\n\nIn popular culture\nIt was used as a theme song in Akira Kurosawa's 1952 film Ikiru. The terminally ill protagonist, played by Takashi Shimura, initially sings this romantic ballad as an expression of loss, and at the end with great contentment. His final performance of the song has been described as \"iconic.\"\nThe song is also referenced in the Japanese manga titled Fushigi Y\u00fbgi: Genbu Kaiden.\nThis music is also used in a Japanese drama titled Haikei, Chichiue-sama.\nThe song is sung in Clemens Klopfenstein's film Macao (1988).\nThe song was also used in the Japanese TV show titled Otomen.\nThe line \"fall in love maidens\" (Koi seyo otome) is used as the subtitle of the video game Sakura Wars 4.\nFrom the song, the phrase \"Life is short, fall in love, maidens...\" (Inochi mijikashi, koi seyo otome...) gained some popularity during the 1990s in Japan. Especially the phrase \"Koi Seyo Otome\" has been used as the title for several songs and a Japanese television drama.\nIn the anime series Kirby: Right Back at Ya!, Episode 42, King Dedede sings a version of the famous phrase \"Life is short, fall in love, maidens...\" (Inochi mijikashi, koi seyo otome...) but replaces \"otome\" with his own name, \"Dedede\". He sings this song on a swing set he built similar to the one in the film. However, this was only in the original version and was not translated into English.\nThe lyrics of the song were used in the novel Boogiepop and Others, as the leitmotif of Kamikishiro Naoko, one of the characters.\nIn the anime Kitsutsuki Tanteidokoro (Woodpecker Detective's Office), the song was recreated by the group \"Now On Air\" with mostly similar lyrics.\nIn the game Bung\u014d to Alchemist (Bungo and Alchemist), character Yoshii Isamu (based on the real-life poet who wrote the lyrics of the song) recites the famous phrase, \"Life is short, fall in love, maidens...\" (Inochi mijikashi, koi seyo otome...) as one of the log in lines that plays when a player logs into the game.\n\nSee also\n\nCarpe diem\n\n\n== References ==","71":"Google Books (previously known as Google Book Search, Google Print, and by its code-name Project Ocean) is a service from Google that searches the full text of books and magazines that Google has scanned, converted to text using optical character recognition (OCR), and stored in its digital database. Books are provided either by publishers and authors through the Google Books Partner Program, or by Google's library partners through the Library Project. Additionally, Google has partnered with a number of magazine publishers to digitize their archives.\nThe Publisher Program was first known as Google Print when it was introduced at the Frankfurt Book Fair in October 2004. The Google Books Library Project, which scans works in the collections of library partners and adds them to the digital inventory, was announced in December 2004.\nThe Google Books initiative has been hailed for its potential to offer unprecedented access to what may become the largest online body of human knowledge and promoting the democratization of knowledge. However, it has also been criticized for potential copyright violations, and lack of editing to correct the many errors introduced into the scanned texts by the OCR process.\nAs of October 2019, Google celebrated 15 years of Google Books and provided the number of scanned books as more than 40 million titles.\nGoogle estimated in 2010 that there were about 130 million distinct titles in the world, and stated that it intended to scan all of them. However, the scanning process in American academic libraries has slowed since the 2000s. Google Book's scanning efforts have been subject to litigation, including Authors Guild v. Google, a class-action lawsuit in the United States, decided in Google's favor (see below). This was a major case that came close to changing copyright practices for orphan works in the United States. A 2023 study by scholars from the University of California, Berkeley and Northeastern University's business schools found that Google Books's digitization of books has led to increased sales for the physical versions of the books.\n\nDetails\nResults from Google Books show up in both the universal Google Search and in the dedicated Google Books search website (books.google.com).\nIn response to search queries, Google Books allows users to view full pages from books in which the search terms appear if the book is out of copyright or if the copyright owner has given permission. If Google believes the book is still under copyright, a user sees \"snippets\" of text around the queried search terms. All instances of the search terms in the book text appear with a yellow highlight.\nThe four access levels used on Google Books are:\n\nFull view: Books in the public domain are available for \"full view\" and can be downloaded for free. In-print books acquired through the Partner Program are also available for full view if the publisher has given permission, although this is rare.\nPreview: For in-print books where permission has been granted, the number of viewable pages is limited to a \"preview\" set by a variety of access restrictions and security measures, some based on user-tracking. Usually, the publisher can set the percentage of the book available for preview. Users are restricted from copying, downloading or printing book previews. A watermark reading \"Copyrighted material\" appears at the bottom of pages. All books acquired through the Partner Program are available for preview.\nSnippet view: A \"snippet view\" \u2013 two to three lines of text surrounding the queried search term \u2013 is displayed in cases where Google does not have permission of the copyright owner to display a preview. This could be because Google cannot identify the owner or the owner declined permission. If a search term appears many times in a book, Google displays no more than three snippets, thus preventing the user from viewing too much of the book. Also, Google does not display any snippets for certain reference books, such as dictionaries, where the display of even snippets can harm the market for the work. Google maintains that no permission is required under copyright law to display the snippet view.\nNo preview: Google also displays search results for books that have not been digitized. As these books have not been scanned, their text is not searchable and only the metadata such as the title, author, publisher, number of pages, ISBN, subject and copyright information, and in some cases, a table of contents and book summary is available. In effect, this is similar to an online library card catalog.\nIn response to criticism from groups such as the American Association of Publishers and the Authors Guild, Google announced an opt-out policy in August 2005, through which copyright owners could provide a list of titles that they do not want scanned, and the request would be respected. The company also stated that it would not scan any in-copyright books between August and 1 November 2005, to provide the owners with the opportunity to decide which books to exclude from the Project. Thus, copyright owners have three choices with respect to any work:\n\nIt can participate in the Partner Program to make a book available for preview or full view, in which case it would share revenue derived from the display of pages from the work in response to user queries.\nIt can let Google scan the book under the Library Project and display snippets in response to user queries.\nIt can opt out of the Library Project, in which case Google will not scan the book. If the book has already been scanned, Google will reset its access level as 'No preview'.\nMost scanned works are no longer in print or commercially available.\nIn addition to procuring books from libraries, Google also obtains books from its publisher partners, through the \"Partner Program\" \u2013 designed to help publishers and authors promote their books. Publishers and authors submit either a digital copy of their book in EPUB or PDF format, or a print copy to Google, which is made available on Google Books for preview. The publisher can control the percentage of the book available for preview, with the minimum being 20%. They can also choose to make the book fully viewable, and even allow users to download a PDF copy. Books can also be made available for sale on Google Play. Unlike the Library Project, this does not raise any copyright concerns as it is conducted pursuant to an agreement with the publisher. The publisher can choose to withdraw from the agreement at any time.\nFor many books, Google Books displays the original page numbers. However, Tim Parks, writing in The New York Review of Books in 2014, noted that Google had stopped providing page numbers for many recent publications (likely the ones acquired through the Partner Program) \"presumably in alliance with the publishers, in order to force those of us who need to prepare footnotes to buy paper editions.\"\n\nScanning of books\nThe project began in 2002 under the codename Project Ocean. Google co-founder Larry Page had always had an interest in digitizing books. When he and Marissa Mayer began experimenting with book scanning in 2002, it took 40 minutes for them to digitize a 300-page book. But soon after the technology had been developed to the extent that scanning operators could scan up to 6000 pages an hour.\nGoogle established designated scanning centers to which books were transported by trucks. The stations could digitize at the rate of 1,000 pages per hour. The books were placed in a custom-built mechanical cradle that adjusted the book spine in place while an array of lights and optical instruments scanned the two open pages. Each page would have two cameras directed at it capturing the image, while a range finder LIDAR overlaid a three-dimensional laser grid on the book's surface to capture the curvature of the paper. A human operator would turn the pages by hand, using a foot pedal to take the photographs. With no need to flatten the pages or align them perfectly, Google's system not only reached a remarkable efficiency and speed but also helped protect the fragile collections from being over-handled. Afterwards, the crude images went through three levels of processing: first, de-warping algorithms used the LIDAR data fix the pages' curvature. Then, optical character recognition (OCR) software transformed the raw images into text, and, lastly, another round of algorithms extracted page numbers, footnotes, illustrations and diagrams.\nMany of the books are scanned using a customized Elphel 323 camera at a rate of 1,000 pages per hour. A patent awarded to Google in 2009 revealed that Google had come up with an innovative system for scanning books that uses two cameras and infrared light to automatically correct for the curvature of pages in a book. By constructing a 3D model of each page and then \"de-warping\" it, Google is able to present flat-looking pages without having to really make the pages flat, which requires the use of destructive methods such as unbinding or glass plates to individually flatten each page, which is inefficient for large scale scanning.\nGoogle decided to omit color information in favour of better spatial resolution, as most out-of-copyright books at the time did not contain colors. Each page image was passed through algorithms that distinguished the text and illustration regions. Text regions were then processed via OCR to enable full-text searching. Google expended considerable resources in coming up with optimal compression techniques, aiming for high image quality while keeping the file sizes minimal to enable access by internet users with low bandwidth.\n\nWebsite functionality\nFor each work, Google Books automatically generates an overview page. This page displays information extracted from the book\u2014its publishing details, a high frequency word map, the table of contents\u2014as well as secondary material, such as summaries, reader reviews (not readable in the mobile version of the website), and links to other relevant texts. A visitor to the page, for instance, might see a list of books that share a similar genre and theme, or they might see a list of current scholarship on the book. This content, moreover, offers interactive possibilities for users signed into their Google account. They can export the bibliographic data and  citations in standard formats, write their own reviews, add it to their library to be tagged, organized, and shared with other people. Thus, Google Books collects these more interpretive elements from a range of sources, including the users, third-party sites like Goodreads, and often the book's author and publisher.\nIn fact, to encourage authors to upload their own books, Google has added several functionalities to the website. The authors can allow visitors to download their ebook for free, or they can set their own purchase price. They can change the price back and forth, offering discounts whenever it suits them. Also, if a book's author chooses to add an ISBN, LCCN or OCLC record number, the service will update the book's url to include it. Then, the author can set a specific page as the link's anchor. This option makes their book more easily discoverable.\n\nNgram Viewer\nThe Ngram Viewer is a service connected to Google Books that graphs the frequency of word usage across their book collection. The service is important for historians and linguists as it can provide an inside look into human culture through word use throughout time periods. This program has fallen under criticism because of errors in the metadata used in the program.\n\nContent issues and criticism\nThe project has received criticism that its stated aim of preserving orphaned and out-of-print works is at risk due to scanned data having errors and such problems not being solved.\n\nScanning errors\nThe scanning process is subject to errors. For example, some pages may be unreadable, upside down, or in the wrong order. Scholars have even reported crumpled pages, obscuring thumbs and fingers, and smeared or blurry images. On this issue, a declaration from Google at the end of scanned books says:\n\nThe digitization at the most basic level is based on page images of the physical books. To make this book available as an ePub formatted file we have taken those page images and extracted the text using Optical Character Recognition (or OCR for short) technology. The extraction of text from page images is a difficult engineering task. Smudges on the physical books' pages, fancy fonts, old fonts, torn pages, etc. can all lead to errors in the extracted text. Imperfect OCR is only the first challenge in the ultimate goal of moving from collections of page images to extracted-text based books. Our computer algorithms also have to automatically determine the structure of the book (what are the headers and footers, where images are placed, whether text is verse or prose, and so forth).\nGetting this right allows us to render the book in a way that follows the format of the original book. Despite our best efforts you may see spelling mistakes, garbage characters, extraneous images, or missing pages in this book. Based on our estimates, these errors should not prevent you from enjoying the content of the book. The technical challenges of automatically constructing a perfect book are daunting, but we continue to make enhancements to our OCR and book structure extraction technologies.\nIn 2009, Google stated that they would start using reCAPTCHA to help fix the errors found in Google Book scans. This method would only improve scanned words that are hard to recognize because of the scanning process and cannot solve errors such as turned pages or blocked words.\nScanning errors have inspired works of art such as published collections of anomalous pages and a Tumblr blog.\n\nErrors in metadata\nScholars have frequently reported rampant errors in the metadata information on Google Books \u2013 including misattributed authors and erroneous dates of publication. Geoffrey Nunberg, a linguist researching on the changes in word usage over time noticed that a search for books published before 1950 and containing the word \"internet\" turned up an unlikely 527 results. Woody Allen is mentioned in 325 books ostensibly published before he was born. Google responded to Nunberg by blaming the bulk of errors on outside contractors.\nOther metadata errors reported include publication dates before the author's birth (e.g. 182 works by Charles Dickens prior to his birth in 1812); incorrect subject classifications (an edition of Moby Dick found under \"computers\", a biography of Mae West classified under \"religion\"), conflicting classifications (10 editions of Whitman's Leaves of Grass all classified as both \"fiction\" and \"nonfiction\"), incorrectly spelled titles, authors, and publishers (Moby Dick: or the White \"Wall\"), and metadata for one book incorrectly appended to a completely different book (the metadata for an 1818 mathematical work leads to a 1963 romance novel).\n\nA review of the author, title, publisher, and publication year metadata elements for 400 randomly selected Google Books records was undertaken. The results show 36% of sampled books in the digitization project contained metadata errors. This error rate is higher than one would expect to find in a typical library online catalog.\nThe overall error rate of 36.75% found in this study suggests that Google Books' metadata has a high rate of error. While \"major\" and \"minor\" errors are a subjective distinction based on the somewhat indeterminate concept of \"findability\", the errors found in the four metadata elements examined in this study should all be considered major.\nMetadata errors based on incorrect scanned dates makes research using the Google Books Project database difficult. Google has shown only limited interest in cleaning up these errors.\n\nLanguage issues\nSome European politicians and intellectuals have criticized Google's effort on linguistic imperialism grounds. They argue that because the vast majority of books proposed to be scanned are in English, it will result in disproportionate representation of natural languages in the digital world. German, Russian, French, and Spanish, for instance, are popular languages in scholarship. The disproportionate online emphasis on English, however, could shape access to historical scholarship, and, ultimately, the growth and direction of future scholarship. Among these critics is Jean-No\u00ebl Jeanneney, the former president of the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France.\n\nGoogle Books versus Google Scholar\nWhile Google Books has digitized large numbers of journal back issues, its scans do not include the metadata required for identifying specific articles in specific issues. This has led the makers of Google Scholar to start their own program to digitize and host older journal articles (in agreement with their publishers).\n\nLibrary partners\nThe Google Books Library Project is aimed at scanning and making searchable the collections of several major research libraries. Along with bibliographic information, snippets of text from a book are often viewable. If a book is out of copyright and in the public domain, the book is fully available to read or download.\nIn-copyright books scanned through the Library Project are made available on Google Books for snippet view. Regarding the quality of scans, Google acknowledges that they are \"not always of sufficiently high quality\" to be offered for sale on Google Play. Also, because of supposed technical constraints, Google does not replace scans with higher quality versions that may be provided by the publishers.\nThe project is the subject of the Authors Guild v. Google lawsuit, filed in 2005 and ruled in favor of Google in 2013, and again, on appeal, in 2015.\nCopyright owners can claim the rights for a scanned book and make it available for preview or full view (by \"transferring\" it to their Partner Program account), or request Google to prevent the book text from being searched.\nThe number of institutions participating in the Library Project has grown since its inception.\n\nInitial partners\nHarvard University, Harvard University Library\nThe Harvard University Library and Google conducted a pilot throughout 2005. The project continued, with the aim of increasing online access to the holdings of the Harvard University Library, which includes more than 15.8 million volumes. While physical access to Harvard's library materials is generally restricted to current Harvard students, faculty, and researchers, or to scholars who can come to Cambridge, the Harvard-Google Project has been designed to enable both members of the Harvard community and users everywhere to discover works in the Harvard collection.\nUniversity of Michigan, University of Michigan Library\nAs of March 2012, 5.5 million volumes were scanned.\nNew York Public Library\nIn this pilot program, NYPL is working with Google to offer a collection of its public domain books, which will be scanned in their entirety and made available for free to the public online. Users will be able to search and browse the full text of these works. When the scanning process is complete, the books may be accessed from both The New York Public Library's website and from the Google search engine.\nUniversity of Oxford, Bodleian Library\nStanford University, Stanford University Libraries (SULAIR)\n\nAdditional partners\nOther institutional partners have joined the project since the partnership was first announced:\n\nAustrian National Library\nBavarian State Library\nBiblioth\u00e8que municipale de Lyon\nBig Ten Academic Alliance\nColumbia University, Columbia University Library System\nComplutense University of Madrid\nCornell University, Cornell University Library\nGhent University, Ghent University Library\/Boekentoren\nKeio University, Keio Media Centers (Libraries)\nNational Library of Catalonia\nPrinceton University, Princeton University Library\nUniversity of California, California Digital Library\nUniversity of Lausanne, Cantonal and University Library of Lausanne\nUniversity of Mysore, Mysore University Library\nThe partnership was for digitizing 800,000 texts, including manuscripts written in palm leaves dating back to 8th century.\nUniversity of Texas at Austin, University of Texas Libraries\nThe partnership was for digitizing the library's Latin American collection \u2013 about half a million volumes.\nUniversity of Virginia, University of Virginia Library\nUniversity of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, University of Wisconsin Libraries\nAs of March 2012, about 600,000 volumes had been scanned.\n\nHistory\n2002: A group of team members at Google officially launch the \"secret 'books' project.\" Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page came up with the idea that later became Google Books while still graduate students at Stanford in 1996. The history page on the Google Books website describes their initial vision for this project: \"in a future world in which vast collections of books are digitized, people would use a 'web crawler' to index the books' content and analyze the connections between them, determining any given book's relevance and usefulness by tracking the number and quality of citations from other books.\" This team visited the sites of some of the larger digitization efforts at that time including the Library of Congress's American Memory Project, Project Gutenberg, and the Universal Library to find out how they work, as well as the University of Michigan, Page's alma mater, and the base for such digitization projects as JSTOR and Making of America. In a conversation with the at that time University President Mary Sue Coleman, when Page found out that the university's current estimate for scanning all the library's volumes was 1,000 years, Page reportedly told Coleman that he \"believes Google can help make it happen in six.\"\n2003: The team works to develop a high-speed scanning process as well as software for resolving issues in odd type sizes, unusual fonts, and \"other unexpected peculiarities.\"\nDecember 2004: Google signaled an extension to its Google Print initiative known as the Google Print Library Project. Google announced partnerships with several high-profile university and public libraries, including the University of Michigan, Harvard (Harvard University Library), Stanford (Green Library), Oxford (Bodleian Library), and the New York Public Library. According to press releases and university librarians, Google planned to digitize and make available through its Google Books service approximately 15 million volumes within a decade. The announcement soon triggered controversy, as publisher and author associations challenged Google's plans to digitize, not just books in the public domain, but also titles still under copyright.\nSeptember\u2013October 2005: Two lawsuits against Google charge that the company has not respected copyrights and has failed to properly compensate authors and publishers. One is a class action suit on behalf of authors (Authors Guild v. Google, September 20, 2005) and the other is a civil lawsuit brought by five large publishers and the Association of American Publishers. (McGraw Hill v. Google, October 19, 2005)\nNovember 2005: Google changed the name of this service from Google Print to Google Book Search. Its program enabling publishers and authors to include their books in the service was renamed Google Books Partner Program, and the partnership with libraries became Google Books Library Project.\n2006: Google added a \"download a pdf\" button to all its out-of-copyright, public domain books. It also added a new browsing interface along with new \"About this Book\" pages.\nAugust 2006: The University of California System announced that it would join the Books digitization project. This includes a portion of the 34 million volumes within the approximately 100 libraries managed by the System.\nSeptember 2006: The Complutense University of Madrid became the first Spanish-language library to join the Google Books Library Project.\nOctober 2006: The University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison announced that it would join the Book Search digitization project along with the Wisconsin Historical Society Library. Combined, the libraries have 7.2 million holdings.\nNovember 2006: The University of Virginia joined the project. Its libraries contain more than five million volumes and more than 17 million manuscripts, rare books and archives.\nJanuary 2007: The University of Texas at Austin announced that it would join the Book Search digitization project. At least one million volumes would be digitized from the university's 13 library locations.\nMarch 2007: The Bavarian State Library announced a partnership with Google to scan more than a million public domain and out-of-print works in German as well as English, French, Italian, Latin, and Spanish.\nMay 2007: A book digitizing project partnership was announced jointly by Google and the Cantonal and University Library of Lausanne.\nMay 2007: The Boekentoren Library of Ghent University announced that it would participate with Google in digitizing and making digitized versions of 19th century books in the French and Dutch languages available online.\nMay 2007: Mysore University announces Google will digitize over 800,000 books and manuscripts\u2013including around 100,000 manuscripts written in Sanskrit or Kannada on both paper and palm leaves.\nJune 2007: The Committee on Institutional Cooperation (rebranded as the Big Ten Academic Alliance in 2016) announced that its twelve member libraries would participate in scanning 10 million books over the course of the next six years.\nJuly 2007: Keio University became Google's first library partner in Japan with the announcement that they would digitize at least 120,000 public domain books.\nAugust 2007: Google announced that it would digitize up to 500,000 both copyrighted and public domain items from Cornell University Library. Google would also provide a digital copy of all works scanned to be incorporated into the university's own library system.\nSeptember 2007: Google added a feature that allows users to share snippets of books that are in the public domain. The snippets may appear exactly as they do in the scan of the book, or as plain text.\nSeptember 2007: Google debuted a new feature called \"My Library\" which allows users to create personal customized libraries, selections of books that they can label, review, rate, or full-text search.\nDecember 2007: Columbia University was added as a partner in digitizing public domain works.\nMay 2008: Microsoft tapered off and planned to end its scanning project, which had reached 750,000 books and 80 million journal articles.\nOctober 2008: A settlement was reached between the publishing industry and Google after two years of negotiation. Google agreed to compensate authors and publishers in exchange for the right to make millions of books available to the public.\nOctober 2008: The HathiTrust \"Shared Digital Repository\" (later known as the HathiTrust Digital Library) is launched jointly by the Committee on Institutional Cooperation and the 11 university libraries in the University of California system, all of which were Google partner libraries, in order to archive and provide academic access to books from their collections scanned by Google and others.\nNovember 2008: Google reached the 7 million book mark for items scanned by Google and by their publishing partners. 1 million were in full preview mode and 1 million were fully viewable and downloadable public domain works. About five million were out of print.\nDecember 2008: Google announced the inclusion of magazines in Google Books. Titles include New York Magazine, Ebony, and Popular Mechanics\nFebruary 2009: Google launched a mobile version of Google Book Search, allowing iPhone and Android phone users to read over 1.5 million public domain works in the US (and over 500,000 outside the US) using a mobile browser. Instead of page images, the plain text of the book is displayed.\nMay 2009: At the annual BookExpo convention in New York, Google signaled its intent to introduce a program that would enable publishers to sell digital versions of their newest books direct to consumers through Google.\nDecember 2009: A French court shut down the scanning of copyrighted books published in France, saying this violated copyright laws. It was the first major legal loss for the scanning project.\nApril 2010: Visual artists were not included in the previous lawsuit and settlement, are the plaintiff groups in another lawsuit, and say they intend to bring more than just Google Books under scrutiny. \"The new class action,\" read the statement, \"goes beyond Google's Library Project, and includes Google's other systematic and pervasive infringements of the rights of photographers, illustrators and other visual artists.\"\nMay 2010: It was reported that Google would launch a digital book store called Google Editions.  It would compete with Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Apple and other electronic book retailers with its own e-book store. Unlike others, Google Editions would be completely online and would not require a specific device (such as kindle, Nook, or iPad).\nJune 2010: Google passed 12 million books scanned.\nAugust 2010: It was announced that Google intends to scan all known existing 129,864,880 books within a decade, amounting to over 4 billion digital pages and 2 trillion words in total.\nDecember 2010: Google eBooks (Google Editions) was launched in the US.\nDecember 2010: Google launched the Ngram Viewer, which collects and graphs data on word usage across its book collection.\nMarch 2011: A federal judge rejected the settlement reached between the publishing industry and Google.\nMarch 2012: Google passed 20 million books scanned.\nMarch 2012: Google reached a settlement with publishers.\nJanuary 2013: The documentary Google and the World Brain was shown at the Sundance Film Festival.\nNovember 2013: Ruling in Authors Guild v. Google, US District Judge Denny Chin sides with Google, citing fair use. The authors said they would appeal.\nOctober 2015: The appeals court sided with Google, declaring that Google did not violate copyright law. According to the New York Times, Google has scanned more than 25 million books.\nApril 2016: The US Supreme Court declined to hear the Authors Guild's appeal, which means the lower court's decision stood, and Google would be allowed to scan library books and display snippets in search results without violating the law.\n\nStatus\nGoogle has been quite secretive regarding its plans on the future of the Google Books project. Scanning operations had been slowing down since at least 2012, as confirmed by the librarians at several of Google's partner institutions. At University of Wisconsin, the speed had reduced to less than half of what it was in 2006. However, the librarians have said that the dwindling pace could be a natural result of maturation of the project \u2013 initially stacks of books were entirely taken up for scanning whereas now only the titles that had not already been scanned needed to be considered. The company's own Google Books timeline page did not mention anything after 2007 even in 2017, and the Google Books blog was merged into the Google Search blog in 2012.\nDespite winning the decade-long litigation in 2017, The Atlantic has said that Google has \"all but shut down its scanning operation.\" In April 2017, Wired reported that there were only a few Google employees working on the project, and new books were still being scanned, but at a significantly lower rate. It commented that the decade-long legal battle had caused Google to lose its ambition.\n\nLegal issues\nThrough the project, library books were being digitized somewhat indiscriminately regardless of copyright status, which led to a number of lawsuits against Google. By the end of 2008, Google had reportedly digitized over seven million books, of which only about one million were works in the public domain. Of the rest, one million were in copyright and in print, and five million were in copyright but out of print. In 2005, a group of authors and publishers brought a major class-action lawsuit against Google for infringement on the copyrighted works. Google argued that it was preserving \"orphaned works\" \u2013 books still under copyright, but whose copyright holders could not be located.\nThe Authors Guild and Association of American Publishers separately sued Google in 2005 for its book project, citing \"massive copyright infringement.\" Google countered that its project represented a fair use and is the digital age equivalent of a card catalog with every word in the publication indexed. The lawsuits were consolidated, and eventually a settlement was proposed. The settlement received significant criticism on a wide variety of grounds, including antitrust, privacy, and inadequacy of the proposed classes of authors and publishers. The settlement was eventually rejected, and the publishers settled with Google soon after. The Authors Guild continued its case, and in 2011 their proposed class was certified. Google appealed that decision, with a number of amici asserting the inadequacy of the class, and the Second Circuit rejected the class certification in July 2013, remanding the case to the District Court for consideration of Google's fair use defense.\nIn 2015 Authors Guild filed another appeal against Google to be considered by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York. Google won the case unanimously based on the argument that they were not showing people the full texts but instead snippets, and they are not allowing people to illegally read the book. In a report, courts stated that they did not infringe on copyright laws, as they were protected under the fair use clause.\nAuthors Guild tried again in 2016 to appeal the decision and this time took their case to be considered by the Supreme Court. The case was rejected, leaving the Second Circuit's decision on the case intact, meaning that Google did not violate copyright laws. This case also set a precedent for other similar cases in regards to fair use laws, as it further clarified the law and expanded it. Such clarification affects other scanning projects similar to Google.\nOther lawsuits followed the Authors Guild's lead. In 2006 a German lawsuit, previously filed, was withdrawn. In June 2006, Herv\u00e9 de la Martini\u00e8re, a French publisher known as La Martini\u00e8re and \u00c9ditions du Seuil, announced its intention to sue Google France. In 2009, the Paris Civil Court awarded 300,000 EUR (approximately 430,000 USD) in damages and interest and ordered Google to pay 10,000 EUR a day until it removes the publisher's books from its database. The court wrote, \"Google violated author copyright laws by fully reproducing and making accessible\" books that Seuil owns without its permission and that Google \"committed acts of breach of copyright, which are of harm to the publishers\". Google said it will appeal. Syndicat National de l'Edition, which joined the lawsuit, said Google has scanned about 100,000 French works under copyright.\nIn December 2009, Chinese author Mian Mian filed a civil lawsuit for $8,900 against Google for scanning her novel, Acid Lovers. This is the first such lawsuit to be filed against Google in China. Also, in November that year, the China Written Works Copyright Society (CWWCS) accused Google of scanning 18,000 books by 570 Chinese writers without authorization. Google agreed on Nov 20 to provide a list of Chinese books it had scanned, but the company refused to admit having \"infringed\" copyright laws.\nIn March 2007, Thomas Rubin, associate general counsel for copyright, trademark, and trade secrets at Microsoft, accused Google of violating copyright law with their book search service. Rubin specifically criticized Google's policy of freely copying any work until notified by the copyright holder to stop.\nGoogle licensing of public domain works is also an area of concern due to using of digital watermarking techniques with the books. Some published works that are in the public domain, such as all works created by the U.S. Federal government, are still treated like other works under copyright, and therefore locked after 1922.\n\nSimilar projects\nProject Gutenberg is a volunteer effort to digitize and archive cultural works, to \"encourage the creation and distribution of eBooks\". It was founded in 1971 by Michael S. Hart and is the oldest digital library. As of October 3, 2015, Project Gutenberg reached 50,000 items in its collection.\nInternet Archive is a non-profit which digitizes over 1000 books a day, as well as mirrors books from Google Books and other sources. As of May 2011, it hosted over 2.8 million public domain books, greater than the approximate 1 million public domain books at Google Books. Open Library, a sister project of Internet Archive, lends 80,000 scanned and purchased commercial ebooks to the visitors of 150 libraries.\nHathiTrust maintains HathiTrust Digital Library since October 13, 2008, which preserves and provides access to material scanned by Google, some of the Internet Archive books, and some scanned locally by partner institutions. As of May 2010, it includes about 6 million volumes, over 1 million of which are public domain (at least in the US).\nACLS Humanities E-Book, an online collection of over 5,400 books of high quality in the humanities and related social sciences, accessible through institutional subscription.\nMicrosoft funded the scanning of 300,000 books to create Live Search Books in late 2006. It ran until May 2008, when the project was abandoned and the books were made freely available on the Internet Archive.\nThe National Digital Library of India (NDLI) is a project under Ministry of Human Resource Development, India. The objective is to integrate several national and international digital libraries in one single web-portal. The NDLI provides free of cost access to many books in English and the Indian languages.\nEuropeana links to roughly 10 million digital objects as of 2010, including video, photos, paintings, audio, maps, manuscripts, printed books, and newspapers from the past 2,000 years of European history from over 1,000 archives in the European Union.\nGallica from the French National Library links to about 4,000,000 digitized books, newspapers, manuscripts, maps and drawings, etc. Created in 1997, the digital library continues to expand at a rate of about 5000 new documents per month. Since the end of 2008, most of the new scanned documents are available in image and text formats. Most of these documents are written in French.\nWikisource\nRunivers\n\nSee also\nA9.com, Amazon.com's book search\nBook Rights Registry\nDigital library\nList of digital library projects\nUniversal library\nNational Electronic Library\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nHoffmann, Anna Lauren (2016). \"Google Books, Libraries, and Self-Respect: Information Justice beyond Distributions\".

His father runs a back-alley shop that specializes in exchanging pachinko-earned goods for cash, which is stereotypically a \"common\" Zainichi occupation. His father had long supported North Korea, but he obtained South Korean nationality to go sightseeing in Hawaii, which required a South Korean passport.\nSugihara's school days are filled with fights that always result in his victory; he and his delinquent peers fill the rest of their time with all kinds of mischief. His best friend, Jong-Il, is a Korean high-school student who had been his classmate in junior high. When Sugihara decided to leave Korean schools for a Japanese high school, their classroom teacher called him a traitor to their homeland. However, Jong-Il supported Sugihara by saying: \u201cWe never have had what you call homeland.\u201d\nOne day, Sugihara attends the birthday party of one of his friends and meets a mysterious Japanese girl whose family name is Sakurai (she is reluctant to use her first name). He takes her out on a couple of dates and they gradually become intimate. However, tragedy strikes when Jong-Il is stabbed to death by a Japanese youth at a railway station. Jong-Il mistakenly thought that the youth was about to attack a female Korean student at the station. The boy, who is carrying a knife, attacks and kills Jong-Il. Sakurai comforts Sugihara, and that night they attempt to make love. She freezes in bed, however, when Sugihara confesses that he is Korean. She declares that she is afraid of a non-Japanese male entering her, and Sugihara leaves.\nIn the meantime, Sugihara's father has been depressed by the news that his younger brother died in North Korea. In an attempt to provoke him, Sugihara blames his father, stating that the second generation of Zainichi, with its sentimentality and powerlessness, has caused the Zainichi much grief and difficulty. They fistfight, and the result is Sugihara's complete defeat. In the wake of the fight, Sugihara finds out that the true reason for his father's adopting South Korean nationality was that he wanted to make his son's life easier.\nSix months later, on Christmas Eve, Sugihara is studying hard in preparation for the college entrance examinations.

Christley of Slant Magazine gave the film a perfect four star rating. David Stratton of The Movie Show called Hana-bi \"an unclassifiable film\" and \"quite extraordinary,\" with co-host Margaret Pomeranz stating \"I was ultimately so moved by it. It did what cinema is meant to do, for me anyway, and that's take me on a journey that is mine, that ultimately ends up inside me, in my heart.\" Stratton concluded that Hana-bi is \"hard to describe to audiences, but all I can say is: Go and see it. It's great.\" The duo both awarded the film five stars out of five.\n\nLegacy\nThe film is included in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die.

The story takes place between 1619 and 1630 during the Edo period and the rule of the Tokugawa shogunate. It tells the story of the r\u014dnin Hanshir\u014d Tsugumo, who requests to commit seppuku (harakiri) within the manor of a local feudal lord, using the opportunity to explain the events that drove him to ask for death before an audience of samurai. The film continues to receive critical acclaim, often considered one of the greatest films of all time.\n\nPlot\nThe film takes place in Edo in the year 1630. A r\u014dnin called Tsugumo Hanshir\u014d arrives at the estate of the Iyi clan and says that he wishes to commit seppuku within the courtyard of the palace. To deter him, Sait\u014d Kageyu, the daimy\u014d's senior counselor, tells Hanshir\u014d the story of another r\u014dnin, Chijiiwa Motome \u2014 formerly of the same clan as Hanshir\u014d.\nSait\u014d scornfully recalls the practice of r\u014dnin requesting the chance to commit seppuku on the clan's land, but in fact hoping to be turned away and given alms. Motome had arrived at the palace a few months earlier and made the same request as Hanshir\u014d. Infuriated by the rising number of \"suicide bluffs\", the three most senior samurai of the clan\u2014Yazaki Hayato, Kawabe Umenosuke, and Omodaka Hikokuro\u2014persuaded Sait\u014d to force Motome to follow through and kill himself, ignoring his request for a couple of days delay. Upon examining Motome's swords, his blades were found to be made of bamboo. Enraged that any samurai would \"pawn his soul\", the House of Iyi forced Motome to disembowel himself with his own bamboo blade, making his death slow, agonizingly painful, and deeply humiliating.\nDespite this warning, Hanshir\u014d insists that he has never heard of Motome and says that he is sincere in wanting to commit seppuku. Just as the ceremony is about to begin, Hanshir\u014d is asked to name the samurai who shall behead him when the ritual is complete. To the shock of Sait\u014d and the Iyi retainers, Hanshir\u014d successively names Hayato, Umenosuke, and Hikokuro \u2014 the three samurai who coerced the suicide of Motome. When messengers are dispatched to summon them, all three decline to come, with each claiming to be too ill to attend.\nWhile waiting for the messengers to return, Hanshir\u014d recounts his life story to the assembled samurai, starting with the admission that he did know Motome. In 1619, his clan was abolished by the Sh\u014dgun. His lord decided to commit seppuku and, as his most senior samurai, Hanshir\u014d planned to die alongside him. To prevent this, Hanshir\u014d's closest friend took his place instead, leaving Hanshir\u014d responsible for his teenage son, Motome. In order to support Motome and his own daughter Miho, Hanshir\u014d rented a hovel in the slums of Edo, taking up work as a fan and umbrella craftsman while Motome became a teacher. Realizing the love between Motome and Miho, Hanshir\u014d arranged for them to marry. Soon after, they had a son, Kingo.\nWhen Miho became ill with tuberculosis, Motome could not bear the thought of losing her and did everything to raise money to hire a doctor. When Kingo also fell ill, Motome left one morning, saying he planned to take out a loan from a moneylender. Later that evening, Hayato, Umenosuke, and Hikokuro brought home Motome's mutilated body, and described and mocked his death before leaving. It is now clear that Motome had requested a delay so he could visit his family and put his affairs in order. A few days later, Kingo died, and Miho lost the will to live and died, leaving Hanshir\u014d with nothing. Finishing his story, Hanshir\u014d explains that his sole desire is to join Motome, Miho, and Kingo in death. He explains, however, that they have every right to ask him whether justice has been exacted for their deaths. Therefore, Hanshir\u014d asks Sait\u014d if he has any statement of regret to convey to Motome, Miho, and Kingo. He explains that, if Sait\u014d does so, he will die without saying another word. Sait\u014d refuses, calling Motome an \"extortionist\" who deserved to die.\nAfter provoking Sait\u014d's laughter by calling the samurai moral code bushido a facade, Hanshir\u014d reveals the last part of his story. Before coming to the Iyi estate, he tracked down Hayato and Umenosuke and cut off their topknots. Hikokuro then visited Hanshir\u014d's hovel and, with great respect, challenged him to a duel. After a brief but tense sword fight, Hikokuro suffers a double disgrace: his sword is broken and his topknot is taken as well. As proof, Hanshir\u014d removes their labelled topknots from his kimono and casts them upon the palace courtyard. He mocks the Iyi clan, saying that if the men he humiliated were true samurai, they would not be hiding out of shame. He also questions the clan's honor and bushido itself, pointing out that they should not have ignored Motome's request for a delay to his seppuku without investigating the reason why he asked, but they were too preoccupied with their supposed honor to care.\nHaving badly lost face, an enraged Sait\u014d calls Hanshir\u014d a madman and orders the retainers to kill him. In a fierce battle, Hanshir\u014d kills four samurai, wounds eight, and contemptuously smashes into pieces the antique suit of armor which symbolizes the glorious history of the House of Iyi. Finally, the clan corners Hanshir\u014d and prepares to kill him not with swords, but with three matchlock guns. As Hanshir\u014d commits seppuku, he is simultaneously shot by all three gunmen.\nTerrified that the Iyi clan will be abolished if word gets out that \"a half starved r\u014dnin\" killed so many of their retainers, Sait\u014d announces that all deaths caused by Hanshir\u014d shall be explained by \"illness\". At the same time, a messenger returns reporting that Hikokuro had killed himself the day before, while Hayato and Umenosuke are both faking illness. Sait\u014d angrily orders that Hayato and Umenosuke be forced to commit seppuku as atonement for losing their topknots. Those three deaths are also to be attributed to \"illness\".\nAs the suit of armor is cleaned and re-erected, a new entry in the official records of the House of Iyi is read by a voiceover. Hanshir\u014d is declared to have been mentally unstable, and he and Motome are both listed as having died through harakiri. The Sh\u014dgun is said to have issued a personal commendation to the lord of the Iyi clan for how his councilors handled the suicide bluffs of Motome and Hanshir\u014d. At the end of his letter, the Sh\u014dgun praises the House of Iyi and their samurai as exemplars of bushido. As workers scrub the blood from the ground of the clan's estate, one of them finds a severed topknot and places it in his work bucket.\n\nCast\nTatsuya Nakadai \u2013 Tsugumo Hanshir\u014d (\u6d25\u96f2 \u534a\u56db\u90ce)\nRentar\u014d Mikuni \u2013 Sait\u014d Kageyu (\u658e\u85e4 \u52d8\u89e3\u7531)\nAkira Ishihama \u2013 Chijiiwa Motome (\u5343\u3005\u5ca9 \u6c42\u5973)\nShima Iwashita \u2013 Tsugumo Miho (\u6d25\u96f2 \u7f8e\u4fdd)\nTetsur\u014d Tamba \u2013 Omodaka Hikokuro (\u6ca2\u6f5f \u5f66\u4e5d\u90ce)\nIchir\u014d Nakatani \u2013 Yazaki Hayato (\u77e2\u5d0e \u96bc\u4eba)\nMasao Mishima \u2013 Inaba Tango (\u7a32\u8449 \u4e39\u5f8c)\nKei Sat\u014d \u2013 Fukushima Masakatsu (\u798f\u5cf6 \u6b63\u52dd)\nYoshio Inaba \u2013 Chijiiwa Jinai (\u5343\u3005\u5ca9 \u9663\u5185)\nYoshiro Aoki \u2013 Kawabe Umenosuke (\u5ddd\u8fba \u53f3\u99ac\u4ecb)\n\nThemes\nWhen asked about the theme of his film, Kobayashi said: \"All of my pictures ... are concerned with resisting an entrenched power. That's what Harakiri is about, of course, and Rebellion as well. I suppose I've always challenged authority\".\nAudie Bock describes the theme of Harakiri as \"the inhumanity of this requirement for those who dutifully adhered to it, and the hypocrisy of those who enforced this practice\". The movie doesn't so much challenge the practice of seppuku; rather, it highlights an instance when it occurred in a punitive and hypocritical environment. The notions of honor and bravery associated with it can be a false front, as the protagonist puts it, serving more as a means of preserving reputations than of actually atoning for a crime or misdeed.\nThe empty suit of armor, shown in the beginning, symbolizes the past glory of the Iyi clan, and is treated by them with reverence. However, the samurai of the Iyi house behave like cowards in the fight with Tsugumo, who mockingly tries to use the armor as a shield before smashing it on the ground. Kobayashi makes a point here that this symbol of military prowess turns out to be an empty one.\nKobayashi also attacks two other important attributes of the samurai rank: the sword and the topknot. Motome finds out that his swords are of no use to him if he cannot provide for his family and so he sells them to pay for his son's medical care. When Tsugumo takes his revenge on the three men complicit in Motome's death, he prefers divesting them of their topknots rather than killing them. At the time, losing one's topknot was the same as losing one's sword, and death would be preferable to such dishonor. However, only one of the three samurai, Omodaka, actually commits seppuku, with the other two being forced by the clan to take their own lives at sword point. Thus, the way Tsugumo takes revenge is very subtle: he makes the clan live by the rules they claim to uphold and which they used to punish Motome.\nThe daily record book of the clan that appears in the beginning and the end of the film \"represents the recorded lies of history\". Tsugumo's death is falsely labeled as suicide, the three samurai and the men he killed are said to have died of natural causes rather than violence, and the entire story of his challenge to the clan is swept under the rug to protect the fa\u00e7ade of \"the unjust power structure\" that the Iyi clan represents.\n\nRelease\nHarakiri was released in Japan in 1962. The film was released by Shochiku Film of America with English subtitles in the United States in December 1963.\n\nReception\nIn a contemporary review, the Monthly Film Bulletin stated that Masaki Kobayashi's \"slow, measured cadence perfectly matches his subject\" and that the \"story itself is beautifully constructed\". The review praised Tatsuya Nakadai's \"brilliant, Mifune-like performance\" and noted that the film was \"on occasion brutal, particularly in the young samurai's terrible agony with his bamboo sword\" and that although \"some critics have remarked [...] that being gory is not the best way to deplore wanton bloodshed, Harakiri still looks splendid with its measured tracking shots, its slow zooms, its reflective overhead shots of the courtyard, and its frequent poised immobility\". The New York Times reviewer Bosley Crowther was unimpressed with \"the tortured human drama in this film\" but added that \"Mr. Kobayashi does superb things with architectural compositions, moving forms and occasionally turbulent gyrations of struggling figures in the CinemaScope-size screen. He achieves a sort of visual mesmerization that is suitable to the curious nightmare mood\". Cid Corman wrote in Film Quarterly that \"the beauty of the film seems largely due to Kobayashi's underlying firmness of conception and prevailing spirit, by an unevasive concern for cinematic values\".\nDonald Richie called it the director's \"single finest picture\" and quoted Kobayashi's mentor Keisuke Kinoshita who named it among the top five greatest Japanese films of all time. Audie Bock wrote: \"Harakiri avoids the sentimentality of some of his earlier films, such as The Human Condition, through a new emphasis on visual-auditory aesthetics with the cold formality of compositions and Takemitsu's electronic score. But none of Kobayashi's social protests is diminished in the film's construction \u2013 it's Mizoguchi-like circularity that bitterly denies any hope for human progress\". Roger Ebert included Harakiri in his list of \"Great Movies\", writing in his 2012 review: \"Samurai films, like westerns, need not be familiar genre stories. They can expand to contain stories of ethical challenges and human tragedy. Harakiri, one of the best of them, is about an older wandering samurai who takes his time to create an unanswerable dilemma for the elder of a powerful clan. By playing strictly within the rules of Bushido Code which governs the conduct of all samurai, he lures the powerful leader into a situation where sheer naked logic leaves him humiliated before his retainers\".\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 100% rating based on 11 critic reviews, with an average rating of 8.40\/10.\n\nAwards\nThe film was entered in the competition category at the 1963 Cannes Film Festival. It lost the Palme d'Or to The Leopard, but received the Special Jury Award.\n\nRemake\nThe film was remade by Japanese director Takashi Miike as a 3D film titled Hara-Kiri: Death of a Samurai. It premiered at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nReferences\nSources\nExternal links\nHarakiri at IMDb\nHarakiri at AllMovie\nHarakiri: Kobayashi and History an essay by Joan Mellen at the Criterion Collection\n\"\u5207\u8179 (Seppuku)\" (in Japanese).

According to the 1998 Guinness World Records, it is the most recognized song in the English language, followed by \"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\". The song's base lyrics have been translated into at least 18 languages. The melody of \"Happy Birthday to You\" comes from the song \"Good Morning to All\", which has traditionally been attributed to American sisters Patty and Mildred J. Hill in 1893, although the claim that the sisters composed the tune is disputed.\nThe song is in the public domain in the United States and the European Union. Warner Chappell Music had previously claimed copyright on the song in the US and collected licensing fees for its use; in 2015, the copyright claim was declared invalid and Warner Chappell agreed to pay back $14 million in licensing fees.\n\nHistory\nPatty Hill was a kindergarten principal in Louisville, Kentucky, developing teaching methods at the Little Loomhouse; her sister Mildred was a pianist and composer. The sisters used \"Good Morning to All\" as a song that young children would find easy to sing. The combination of melody and lyrics in \"Happy Birthday to You\" first appeared in print in 1912. None of the early appearances of the \"Happy Birthday to You\" lyrics included credits or copyright notices. The Summy Company registered a copyright in 1935, crediting authors Preston Ware Orem and Mrs. R. R. Forman. In 1988, Warner\/Chappell Music purchased the company owning the copyright for US$25 million, with the value of \"Happy Birthday\" estimated at US$5 million. Warner claimed that the United States copyright would not expire until 2030 and that unauthorized public performances of the song were illegal unless royalties were paid. In February 2010, the royalty for a single use was US$700. By one estimate, the song is the highest-earning single song in history. In the European Union, the copyright for the song expired on January 1, 2017.\nThe American copyright status of \"Happy Birthday to You\" began to draw more attention with the passage of the Copyright Term Extension Act in 1998. The Supreme Court upheld the Act in Eldred v. Ashcroft in 2003, and Associate Justice Stephen Breyer specifically mentioned \"Happy Birthday to You\" in his dissenting opinion. American law professor Robert Brauneis extensively researched the song and concluded in 2010 \"it is almost certainly no longer under copyright.\" Good Morning to You Productions sued Warner\/Chappell for falsely claiming copyright to the song in 2013. In September 2015, a federal judge declared that the Warner\/Chappell copyright claim was invalid, ruling that the copyright registration applied only to a specific piano arrangement of the song and not to its lyrics and melody. In 2016, Warner\/Chappell settled for $14 million, and the court declared that \"Happy Birthday to You\" was in the public domain.\n\nLyrics\n\"Happy birthday to you\"\nThe person whose birthday is being celebrated is filled in for \"[NAME]\".\n\nSince the syllable lengths and scansion of people's names may vary, the measure that includes the [NAME] invocation is traditionally notated with a fermata to adapt the meter.\n\nLyrics with melody\nTraditional variations\nAmong English-speakers, it is traditional at a birthday party for the guests celebrating the birthday to sing the song \"Happy Birthday to You\" to the birthday person, often when presenting a birthday cake. After the song is sung, party guests sometimes add wishes like \"and many more!\" expressing the hope that the birthday person will enjoy a long life. In the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, immediately after \"Happy Birthday\" has been sung, it is traditional for one of the guests to lead with \"Hip hip ...\" and then for all of the other guests to join in and say \"... hooray!\" This cheer normally is given three times in a row.\nIn regions of America and Canada, especially at young children's birthdays, immediately after \"Happy Birthday\" has been sung, it is not uncommon for the singers to segue into \"How old are you now? How old are you now? How old are you now, how old are you now?\" and then count up: \"Are you one? Are you two? Are you ...\" until they reach the right age or often, instead of counting, \"and many more!\" for those who are older.\n\nCopyright status\nThe music and lyrics are in the public domain in the European Union and the United States. The copyright expired in the European Union on January 1, 2017. A U.S. federal court ruled in 2016 that Warner and Chappell's copyright claim was invalid and there was no other claim to copyright.\n\"Happy Birthday to You\" dates from the late 19th century, when sisters Patty and Mildred J. Hill introduced the song \"Good Morning to All\" to Patty's kindergarten class in Kentucky. They published the tune in their 1893 songbook Song Stories for the Kindergarten with Chicago publisher Clayton F. Summy. Kembrew McLeod stated that the Hill sisters likely copied the tune and lyrical idea from other popular and similar nineteenth-century songs, including Horace Waters' \"Happy Greetings to All\" from 1858, \"Good Night to You All\", also from 1858, \"A Happy New Year to All\" from 1875, and \"A Happy Greeting to All\", published 1885. However, U.S. law professor Robert Brauneis disputes this, noting that these earlier songs had quite different melodies.\nThe complete text of \"Happy Birthday to You\" first appeared in print as the final four lines of Edith Goodyear Alger's poem \"Roy's Birthday\", published in A Primer of Work and Play, copyrighted by D. C. Heath in 1901, with no reference to the words being sung. The first book including \"Happy Birthday\" lyrics set to the tune of \"Good Morning to All\" that bears a date of publication is The Elementary Worker and His Work, from 1911, but earlier references exist to a song called \"Happy Birthday to You\", including an article from 1901 in the Inland Educator and Indiana School Journal. In 1924, Robert Coleman included \"Good Morning to All\" in a songbook with the birthday lyrics as a second verse. Coleman also published \"Happy Birthday\" in The American Hymnal in 1933. Children's Praise and Worship published the song in 1928, edited by Byers, Byrum, and Koglin.\nThe Summy Company, publisher of \"Good Morning to All\", copyrighted piano arrangements by Preston Ware Orem and a second verse by Mrs. R. R. Forman. This served as the legal basis for the claim that Summy Company legally registered the copyright for the song, as well as the later renewal of these copyrights.\nSummy Company became the Summy\u2013Birchard Company in 1957, and this became a division of Birch Tree Group Limited in 1970. Warner\/Chappell Music acquired Birch Tree Group Limited in 1988 for US$25 million. The company continued to insist that one could not sing the \"Happy Birthday to You\" lyrics for profit without paying royalties; in 2008, Warner collected about US$5,000 per day (US$2 million per year) in royalties for the song. Warner\/Chappell claimed copyright for every use in film, television, radio, and anywhere open to the public, and for any group where a substantial number of those in attendance were not family or friends of the performer. Brauneis cited problems with the song's authorship and the notice and renewal of the copyright, and concluded: \"It is almost certainly no longer under copyright.\"\nIn the European Union, copyright lasts for the life of the author plus 70 years. Patty Hill died in 1946 as the last surviving author, so the copyright expired in these countries on January 1, 2017.\n\n2013 lawsuit\nOn June 13, 2013, documentary filmmaker Jennifer Nelson filed a putative class action suit in federal court for the Southern District of New York against Warner\/Chappell in the name of her production company Good Morning to You Productions. She had paid US$1,500 to secure the rights as part of a documentary that she was making about the song and its history. Her complaint relied heavily on Brauneis's research, and sought the return of her money and all royalties collected by the company from other filmmakers since 2009. A week later, Rupa Marya v. Warner Chappell Music Inc was filed in the Central District of California. Five weeks later, Nelson refiled the case there, and the cases were combined. In April 2014, Warner's motion to dismiss had been denied without prejudice, and discovery began under an agreed plan with respect to Claim One, declaratory judgment as to whether \"Happy Birthday to You\" was in the public domain. The court was expected to rule on the motion for summary judgment as to the merits issues on Claim One. A jury trial was requested.\nNelson's attorneys Betsy Manifold and Mark Rifkin presented new evidence on July 28, 2015, one day before a scheduled ruling, which they argued was conclusive proof that the song was in the public domain, \"thus making it unnecessary for the Court to decide the scope or validity of the disputed copyrights, much less whether Patty Hill abandoned any copyright she may have had to the lyrics\". They had been given access to documents previously held back from them by Warner\/Chappell, which included a copy of the 15th edition of The Everyday Song Book published in 1927. The book contained \"Good Morning and Happy Birthday\", but the copy was blurry, obscuring a line of text below the title. Manifold and Rifkin located a clearer copy of an edition published in 1922 that also contained the \"Happy Birthday\" lyrics. The previously obscured line was revealed to be the credit \"Special permission through courtesy of The Clayton F Summy Co.\" Manifold and Rifkin argued that the music and lyrics were published without a valid copyright notice as was required at the time, so \"Happy Birthday\" was in the public domain.\nWarner\/Chappell disputed the evidence, arguing that, unless there was \"necessary authorization from the copyright owner\", the \"Happy Birthday\" lyrics and sheet music would still be subject to common law copyright as an unpublished work, and that it was unknown whether the \"special permission\" from the Summy Company covered \"Good Morning to All\", \"Happy Birthday\", or both, thus alleging that the publication in The Everyday Song Book was unauthorized. The company also argued that it was not acting in bad faith in withholding the evidence of the 1927 publication.\nOn September 22, 2015, federal judge George H. King ruled that the Warner\/Chappell copyright claim over the lyrics was invalid. The 1935 copyright held by Warner\/Chappell applied only to a specific piano arrangement of the song, not the lyrics or melody. The court held that the question of whether the 1922 and 1927 publications were authorized, thus placing the song in the public domain, presented questions of fact that would need to be resolved at trial. However, Warner\/Chappell had failed to prove that it actually had ever held a copyright to the lyrics, so the court was able to grant summary judgment to the plaintiffs, thus resolving the case.\nSome initial news sources characterized the decision as ruling that the song was in the public domain, but the decision did not go so far, holding only that Warner\/Chappell did not prove they owned the copyright. However, because there were no other claimants to the copyright, and the copyright to the melody long ago expired, the plaintiffs suggested that the song was de facto in the public domain. Also, the judge ruled that the song was not copyrighted by Summy Co., who had written in the song book, \"Special permission through courtesy of the Clayton F. Summy Co.\" Since there was no evidence Summy Co. had copyright on the song, the song is still considered to be in the public domain.\nBefore the lawsuit, Warner\/Chappell had been earning $2 million a year licensing the song for commercial use, with a notable example the $5,000 paid by the filmmakers of the 1994 documentary Hoop Dreams in order to safely distribute the film. On February 8, 2016, Warner\/Chappell agreed to pay a settlement of $14 million to those who had licensed the song, and would allow a final judgment declaring the song to be in the public domain, with a final hearing scheduled in March 2016. On June 28, 2016, the final settlement was officially granted and the court declared that the song was in the public domain. The following week, Nelson's short-form documentary Happy Birthday: My Campaign to Liberate the People's Song was published online by The Guardian.\nIn the wake of their success, the lawyers involved in the \"Happy Birthday\" lawsuit filed similar lawsuits regarding \"We Shall Overcome\" and \"This Land Is Your Land\".\n\nPublic performances\nOne of the most famous performances of \"Happy Birthday to You\" was Marilyn Monroe's rendition to US President John F. Kennedy in May 1962. Another notable use was by comedy pianist Victor Borge, who played the song in the styles of various composers, or would begin playing Moonlight Sonata, smoothly transitioning into the song.\nThe Beatles recorded \"Happy Birthday Dear Saturday Club\" for the BBC's radio programme's fifth anniversary. This recording is included on the compilation album On Air \u2013 Live at the BBC Volume 2, released in 2013.\nIn the 1987 documentary Eyes on the Prize about the U.S. civil rights movement, there was a birthday party scene in which Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s discouragement began to lift. After its initial release, the film was unavailable for sale or broadcast for many years because of the cost of clearing many copyrights, of which \"Happy Birthday to You\" was one. Grants in 2005 for copyright clearances allowed PBS to rebroadcast the film.\nIn 2010, the Western classical music conductor Zubin Mehta conducted the orchestra to play variations of \"Happy Birthday\" in the styles of various Western classical music composers, including Wagner, Bach, Mozart and Beethoven, and in the Viennese, New Orleans and Hungarian composition styles.\n\nSee also\nList of birthday songs\n\"The ABC Song\"\nCopyfraud\nCopyright troll\nGreeting Prelude, an orchestral work by Igor Stravinsky based on \"Happy Birthday\"\n\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\nExternal links\n\nFree sheet music of \"Happy Birthday to You\" from Cantorion.org\nSong Stories for the Kindergarten by Mildred Hill: containing the song \"Good morning to you\" at the International Music Score Library Project\nThe Happy Birthday Song and The Little Loomhouse\nMars rover Curiosity plays \"Happy Birthday\" to itself on YouTube in 2013\n\"The Happy Birthday Song\".

Produced by Toho and distributed by Film Distribution Corporation, the film is propaganda produced with support from the Navy Ministry that was intended to influence the Japanese public into believing they could prevail in the Pacific War.\nThe military reportedly converted the idea of a documentary film on the attack on Pearl Harbor that featured special effects since it was difficult to record footage of the attack. Prior to the attack and Japan's subsequent entry into World War II, an Imperial Japanese Navy official met Tsuburaya and requested the production of a film about the attack as soon as possible when the war broke out. Production took place from May to November 1942, on a record breaking budget of \u00a5770,000.\nThe War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya was released on December 3, 1942, to critical acclaim. The film won Kinema Junpo's Best Picture Award and Tsuburaya received an award for his special effects. Reportedly viewed by 100 million people in Japan and its occupied territories, it became the highest-grossing film in the history of Japanese cinema upon its distribution.\n\nPlot\nIn 1936, Imperial Japanese Navy pilot Tadaaki Tachibana visits his aunt's farm, where younger cousin Yoshikazu Tomoda expresses his wish to become a pilot. Tadaaki encourages Yoshikazu only after challenging him to a cliff jump.\nYoshikazu undergoes basic training from 1937, participating in rowing, kend\u014d, wrestling, and rugby. His drill instructor introduces the notion of facing adversity with the proper \"spirit\". One morning, the Marco Polo Bridge Incident is reported in the cadets' newspaper.  The cadets intensify their training as the events of the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Second World War in Europe unfold.  Their drill instructor declares that the situation in China may only be resolved through the defeat of the United States and the British Empire.\nAfter a brief visit to his family, Yoshikazu progresses to training as a fighter pilot. He experiences survivor guilt when another cadet dies during a training exercise aboard an aircraft carrier. Tadaaki advises him not to give up his training, citing his own experiences in the military. Yoshikazu's sister Kikuko is concerned about the explosion of a world war, but informs him that their mother has accepted his decision to fight.\nIn late 1941, Yoshikazu is among those aboard an aircraft carrier destined for Pearl Harbor, although their mission is not immediately clear. As the pilots prepare for the attack, the officers listen for results over an American radio station. The mission is portrayed as a success: the torpedoes hit their intended target ships, and reinforcements engage in a dogfight with USAAF fighter planes. However, in a \"precious sacrifice\", one damaged Japanese plane crashes into an American hangar.\nMeanwhile in Japanese-occupied French Indochina, a separate unit receives a briefing concerning the movements of HMS Repulse and HMS Prince of Wales. An initial attempt to bomb the ships during their nighttime departure from Singapore is aborted. Despite the ships leaving the range of the bombers, their crews are instructed to re-attempt the mission. The crew of one bomber, acknowledging that they lack the fuel to return home, proceeds with the attack on the British fleet. This mission too is successful, although the Prince of Wales incidentally sinks after the bomber runs out of ammunition.\nYoshikazu's family listens to a report of the attack on the radio, as do the officers aboard the aircraft carrier. One officer expresses his pleasure at Japan's strategic position.\n\nCast\nSusumu Fujita\nSetsuko Hara\nFumito Matsuo\nKunio Mita\nDenjir\u014d \u014ck\u014dchi\nJiro Takano\nDaihachiro Takebayashi\nHaruo Tanaka\nFrank Tokunaga as Bunroku Tokunaga\nHiroshi Yamagawa\n\nProduction\nPreproduction\nBefore Japan officially entered the war on the same day as the Pearl Harbor attack, Michibu Navy Major Sh\u014dichi Hamada reportedly met Tsuburaya and requested the production of a film about the attack as soon as possible when the war broke out.\n\nFilming\nHawai Mare oki kaisen was the most costly film made in Japan up to that time, costing over $380,000, when a typical film cost no more than $40,000. It used special effects and miniature models to create realistic battle scenes. These were intercut with genuine newsreel material to make the appearance of a documentary. The film was released during the week of the first anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.\nThe special effects are by Eiji Tsuburaya.\n\nReception\nBox office\nWithin its first eight days at the Japanese box office, the film had grossed \u00a51,115,000. According to Toho, it was viewed by 100 million people in Japan and the country's occupied territories.\n\nCritical response\nJoseph L. Anderson comments that Hawai Mare oki kaisen was \"representative of the national-policy films\", with the aim of dramatizing \"the Navy Spirit as culminated at Pearl Harbor.\" Critics at the time considered it the best film of 1942.\n\nDouglas MacArthur's response\nThe War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya was confiscated by Supreme Command Allied Powers after the war, who mistook it for genuine news footage of the attack, and it was released by Movietone as such.\n\nAccolades\nSee also\nStorm Over the Pacific, Toho, 1960\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\nHawai Mare oki kaisen at IMDb\nScene from the film on YouTube","80":"The health care system in Japan provides different types of services, including screening examinations, prenatal care and infectious disease control, with the patient accepting responsibility for 30% of these costs while the government pays the remaining 70%. Payment for personal medical services is offered by a universal health care insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. All residents of Japan are required by the law to have health insurance coverage. People without insurance from employers can participate in a national health insurance program, administered by local governments. Patients are free to select physicians or facilities of their choice and cannot be denied coverage. Hospitals, by law, must be run as non-profits and be managed by physicians.\nMedical fees are strictly regulated by the government to keep them affordable. Depending on the family's income and the age of the insured, patients are responsible for paying 10%, 20%, or 30% of medical fees, with the government paying the remaining fee. Also, monthly thresholds are set for each household, again depending on income and age, and medical fees exceeding the threshold are waived or reimbursed by the government.\nUninsured patients are responsible for paying 100% of their medical fees, but fees are waived for low-income households receiving a government subsidy.\n\nHistory\nThe modern Japanese Health care system started to develop just after the Meiji Restoration with the introduction of Western medicine. The statutory insurance, however, had not been established until 1927 when the first employee health insurance plan was created.\nIn 1961, Japan achieved universal health insurance coverage, and almost everyone became insured. However, the copayment rates differed greatly. While those who enrolled in employees' health insurance needed to pay only a nominal amount at the first physician visit, their dependents and those who enrolled in National Health Insurance had to pay 50% of the fee schedule price for all services and medications. From 1961 to 1982, the copayment rate was gradually lowered to 30%.\nSince 1983, all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance.\nIn the late 1980s, government and professional circles were considering changing the system so that primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of care would be clearly distinguished within each geographical region. Further, facilities would be designated by level of care and referrals would be required to obtain more complex care. Policymakers and administrators also recognized the need to unify the various insurance systems and control costs.\nBy the early 1990s, there were more than 1,000 mental hospitals, 8,700 general hospitals, and 1,000 comprehensive hospitals with a total capacity of 1.5 million beds. Hospitals provide both out-patient and in-patient care. In addition, 79,000 clinics offered primarily out-patient services, and there were 48,000 dental clinics. Most physicians and hospitals sold medication directly to patients, but there were 36,000 pharmacies where patients could purchase synthetic or herbal medication.\nNational health expenditures rose from about 1 trillion yen in 1965 to nearly 20 trillion yen in 1989, or from slightly more than 5% to more than 6% of Japan's national income.\nOne problem has been an uneven distribution of health personnel, with rural areas favoured over cities.\nIn the early 1990s, there were nearly 191,400 physicians, 66,800 dentists, and 333,000 nurses, plus more than 200,000 people licensed to practice massage, acupuncture, moxibustion, and other East Asian therapeutic methods.\n\nCost\nIn 2008, Japan spent about 8.2% of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP), or US$2,859.7 or 405,737.84 Yen per capita, on health, ranking 20th among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. The share of gross domestic product was the same as the average of OECD states in 2008. According to 2018 data, share of gross domestic products rose to 10.9% of GDP, overtaking the OECD average of 8.8%.\nThe government has controlled costs over decades using the national uniform fee schedule for reimbursement. The government is also able to reduce fees when the economy stagnates. In the 1980s, health care spending was rapidly increasing as was the case with many industrialized nations. While some countries like the U.S. allowed costs to rise, Japan tightly regulated the health industry to rein in costs. Fees for all health care services are set every two years by negotiations between the health ministry and physicians. The negotiations determine the fee for every medical procedure and medication, and fees are identical across the country. If physicians attempt to game the system by ordering more procedures to generate income, the government may lower the fees for those procedures at the next round of fee setting. This was the case when the fee for an MRI was lowered by 35% in 2002 by the government. Thus, as of 2009, in the U.S. an MRI of the neck region could cost $1,500, but in Japan, it cost US$98. \nOnce a patient's monthly copayment reaches a cap, no further copayment is required. The threshold for the monthly copayment amount is tiered into three levels according to income and age.\nTo cut costs, Japan uses generic drugs. As of 2010, Japan had a goal of adding more drugs to the nation's National Health Insurance listing. Age-related conditions remain one of the biggest concerns. Pharmaceutical companies focus on marketing and research toward that part of the population.\n\nProvision\nPeople in Japan have the longest life expectancy at birth of those in any country in the world. Life expectancy at birth was 83 years in 2009 (male 79.6 years, female 86.4 years). This was achieved in a fairly short time through a rapid reduction in mortality rates secondary to communicable diseases from the 1950s to the early 1960s, followed by a large reduction in stroke mortality rates after the mid-60s.\nIn 2008 the number of acute care beds per 1000 total population was 8.1, which was higher than in other OECD countries such as the U.S. (2.7). Comparisons based on this number may be difficult to make, however, since 34% of patients were admitted to hospitals for longer than 30 days even in beds that were classified as acute care. Staffing per bed is very low. There are four times more MRI scanners per head, and six times the number of CT scanners, compared with the average European provision. The average patient visits a doctor 13 times a year - more than double the average for OECD countries.\nIn 2008 per 1000 population, the number of practising physicians was 2.2, which was almost the same as that in the U.S. (2.4). The number of practising nurses was 9.5, which was a little lower than that in U.S. (10.8), and almost the same as that in UK (9.5) or in Canada (9.2). Physicians and nurses are licensed for life with no requirement for license renewal, continuing medical or nursing education, and no peer or utilization review. OECD data lists specialists and generalists together for Japan because these two are not officially differentiated. Traditionally, physicians have been trained to become subspecialists, but once they have completed their training, only a few have continued to practice as subspecialists. The rest have left the large hospitals to practice in small community hospitals or open their clinics without any formal retraining as general practitioners. Unlike many countries, there is no system of general practitioners in Japan, instead, patients go straight to specialists, often working in clinics.\n\nQuality\nJapanese outcomes for high-level medical treatment of physical health are generally competitive with those of the US. A comparison of two reports in the New England Journal of Medicine by MacDonald et al. (2001)  and Sakuramoto et al.(2007)  suggest that outcomes for gastro-esophageal cancer is better in Japan than the US in both patients treated with surgery alone and surgery followed by chemotherapy. Japan excels in the five-year survival rates of colon cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer and liver cancer based on the comparison of a report by the American Association of Oncology and another report by the Japan Foundation for the Promotion of Cancer Research. The same comparison shows that the US excels in the five-year survival of rectal cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer and malignant lymphoma. Surgical outcomes tend to be better in Japan for most cancers while overall survival tends to be longer in the US due to the more aggressive use of chemotherapy in late-stage cancers. A comparison of the data from the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) 2009 and Japan Renology Society 2009 shows that the annual mortality of patients undergoing dialysis in Japan is 13% compared to 22.4% in the US. Five-year survival of patients under dialysis is 59.9% in Japan and 38% in the US.\nIn an article titled \"Does Japanese Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Qualify as a Global Leader?\" Masami Ochi of Nippon Medical School points out that Japanese coronary bypass surgeries surpass those of other countries in multiple criteria. According to the International Association of Heart and Lung Transplantation, the five-year survival of heart transplant recipients around the world who had their heart transplants between 1992 and 2009 was 71.9% (ISHLT 2011.6) while the five-year survival of Japanese heart transplant recipients is 96.2% according to a report by Osaka University. However, only 120 heart transplants have been performed domestically by 2011 due to a lack of donors.\nIn contrast to physical health care, the quality of mental health care in Japan is relatively low compared to most other developed countries. Despite reforms, Japan's psychiatric hospitals continue to largely rely on outdated methods of patient control, with their rates of compulsory medication, isolation (solitary confinement) and physical restraints (tying patients to beds) much higher than in other countries. High levels of deep vein thrombosis have been found in restrained patients in Japan, which can lead to disability and death. Rather than decreasing the use of restraints as has been done in many other countries, the incidence of use of medical restraints in Japanese hospitals doubled in the nearly ten years from 2003 (5,109 restrained patients) through 2014 (10,682).\nThe 47 local government prefectures have some responsibility for overseeing the quality of health care, but there is no systematic collection of treatment or outcome data. They oversee annual hospital inspections. The Japan Council for Quality Health Care accredits about 25% of hospitals. One problem with the quality of Japanese medical care is the lack of transparency when medical errors occur. In 2015 Japan introduced a law to require hospitals to conduct reviews of patient care for any unexpected deaths and to provide the reports to the next of kin and a third party organization. However, it is up to the hospital to decide whether the death was unexpected. Neither patients nor the patients' families are allowed to request reviews, which makes the system ineffective. Meanwhile, Japanese healthcare providers are reluctant to provide open information because Japanese medical journalists tend to embellish, sensationalize, and in some cases fabricate anti-medical criticisms with little recourse for medical providers to correct the false claims once they have been made. However, the increased number of hospital visits per capita compared to other nations and the generally good overall outcome suggests the rate of adverse medical events are not higher than in other countries.\nIt is important to have efficiency in sending patients to the correct medical location because there is an understaffing problem. Around 92% of hospitals in Japan have an insufficient number of doctors while having sufficient nurses. While only 10% of hospitals have a sufficient number of doctors and an insufficient number of nurses.\nA no-fault approach to cases of children born with cerebral palsy was introduced in 2009. This led to reduced litigation and 25% fewer children born with the condition.\n\nAccess\nIn Japan, services are provided either through regional\/national public hospitals or through private hospitals\/clinics, and patients have universal access to any facility, though hospitals tend to charge more to those patients without a referral. As mentioned above, costs in Japan tend to be quite low compared to those in other developed countries, but utilization rates are much higher. Most one-doctor clinics do not require reservations and same-day appointments are the rule rather than the exception. Japanese patients favour medical technology such as CT scans and MRIs, and they receive MRIs at a per capita rate 8 times higher than the British and twice as high as Americans. In most cases, CT scans, MRIs and many other tests do not require waiting periods. Japan has about three times as many hospitals per capita as the US and, on average, Japanese people visit the hospital more than four times as often as the average American.\nAccess to medical facilities is sometimes abused. Some patients with mild illnesses tend to go straight to the hospital emergency departments rather than accessing more appropriate primary care services. This causes a delay in helping people who have more urgent and severe conditions who need to be treated in the hospital environment. There is also a problem with misuse of ambulance services, with many people taking ambulances to hospitals with minor issues not requiring an ambulance. In turn, this causes delays for ambulances arriving for serious emergencies. Nearly 50% of the ambulance rides in 2014 were minor conditions where citizens could have taken a taxi instead of an ambulance to get treated.\nDue to the issue of large numbers of people visiting hospitals for relatively minor problems, a shortage of medical resources can be an issue in some regions. The problem has become a wide concern in Japan, particularly in Tokyo. A report has shown that more than 14,000 emergency patients were rejected at least three times by hospitals in Japan before getting treatment. A government survey for 2007, which got a lot of attention when it was released in 2009, cited several such incidents in the Tokyo area, including the case of an elderly man who was turned away by 14 hospitals before dying 90 minutes after being finally admitted, and that of a pregnant woman complaining of a severe headache being refused admission to seven Tokyo hospitals and later dying of an undiagnosed brain hemorrhage after giving birth. The so-called \"tarai mawashi\" (ambulances being rejected by multiple hospitals before an emergency patient is admitted) has been attributed to several factors such as medical reimbursements set so low that hospitals need to maintain very high occupancy rates to stay solvent, hospital stays being cheaper for the patient than low-cost hotels, the shortage of specialist doctors and low-risk patients with minimal need for treatment flooding the system.\n\nInsurance\nHealth insurance is, in principle, mandatory for residents of Japan, but there is no penalty for the 10% of individuals who choose not to comply, making it optional in practice. Apart from conventional Western medicine and healthcare, Japanese insurance also covers traditional health therapies like acupuncture and health massages, etc., from licensed therapists. There is a total of eight health insurance systems in Japan, with around 3,500 health insurers. According to Mark Britnell, it is widely recognised that there are too many small insurers. They can be divided into two categories, Employees' Health Insurance (\u5065\u5eb7\u4fdd\u967a, Kenk\u014d-Hoken) and National Health Insurance (\u56fd\u6c11\u5065\u5eb7\u4fdd\u967a, Kokumin-Kenk\u014d-Hoken). Employees\u2019 Health Insurance is broken down into the following systems:\n\nUnion Managed Health Insurance\nGovernment Managed Health Insurance\nSeaman's Insurance\nNational Public Workers Mutual Aid Association Insurance\nLocal Public Workers Mutual Aid Association Insurance\nPrivate School Teachers\u2019 and Employees\u2019 Mutual Aid Association Insurance\nNational Health Insurance is generally reserved for self-employed people and students, and social insurance is normally for corporate employees. National Health Insurance has two categories:\n\nNational Health Insurance for each city, town or village\nNational Health Insurance Union\nPublic health insurance covers most citizens\/residents and the system pays 70% or more of medical and prescription drug costs with the remainder being covered by the patient (upper limits apply). The monthly insurance premium is paid per household and scaled to annual income. Supplementary private health insurance is available only to cover the co-payments or non-covered costs and has a fixed payment per day in hospital or per surgery performed, rather than per actual expenditure.\nThere is a separate system of insurance (Kaigo Hoken) for long-term care, run by the municipal governments. People over 40 have contributions of around 2% of their income.\nInsurance for individuals is paid for by both employees and employers. This ends up accounting for 95% of the coverage for individuals. Patients in Japan must pay 30% of medical costs. If there is a need to pay a much higher cost, they get reimbursed up to 80-90%. Seniors who are covered by SHSS ( Senior insurance) only pay 10% out of pocket. As of 2016, healthcare providers spend billions on inpatient care and outpatient care. 152 billion is spent on inpatient care while 147 billion is spent on outpatient care. As far as the long term goes, 41 billion is spent.\nToday, Japan has the severe problem of paying for rising medical costs, benefits that are not equal from one person to another and even burdens on each of the nation's health insurance programs. One of the ways Japan has improved its healthcare more recently is by passing the Industrial Competitiveness Enhancement Action Plan. The goal is to help prevent diseases so people live longer. If preventable diseases are prevented, Japan will not have to spend as much on other costs. The action plan also provides a higher quality of medical and health care.\n\nSee also\nHealth in Japan\nAging of Japan\nBirth in Japan\nHikikomori\nSuicide in Japan\nErwin B\u00e4lz\u2014a foreign government advisor and cofounder of modern medicine in Japan\nHealth care compared\u2014tabular comparisons with the U.S., Canada, and other countries not shown above\nList of hospitals in Japan\nPublic health centres in Japan\nSocial welfare in Japan\n\nReferences\nCitations\n\n\n=== Sources ===","81":"Her Brother (\u304a\u3068\u3046\u3068, Ot\u014dto, lit. \"Younger brother\") is a 1960 Japanese drama film directed by Kon Ichikawa.

The film is loosely based on the 1959 novel King's Ransom by Ed McBain (Evan Hunter). It follows the story of a board member for a Japanese company who is forced to make a decision between using a vast amount of wealth to gain executive control and helping his employee by lending him the money to free his child from kidnappers.\nThe film stars Toshiro Mifune as Kingo Gondo, a wealthy man who puts himself into debt in a risky bid to enact a hostile takeover of National Shoes, and Tatsuya Nakadai as Inspector Tokura, the man charged with solving the kidnapping case.\n\nPlot\nA wealthy executive named Kingo Gondo (Toshiro Mifune) is in a struggle to gain control of a company called National Shoes. One faction wants the company to make cheap, low-quality shoes for the impulse market as opposed to the sturdy and high-quality shoes the company is currently known for. Gondo believes that the long-term future of the company will be best served by well-made shoes with modern styling, though this plan is unpopular because it means lower profits in the short term. He has secretly set up a leveraged buyout to gain control of the company, mortgaging all he has.\nJust as he is about to put his plan into action, he receives a phone call from someone claiming to have kidnapped his son, Jun. Gondo is prepared to pay the ransom, but the call is dismissed as a prank when Jun comes in from playing outside. However, Jun's playmate, Shinichi, the child of Gondo's chauffeur, is missing and the kidnappers have mistakenly abducted him instead.\nIn another phone call, the kidnapper reveals that he has discovered his mistake but still demands the same ransom. Gondo is now forced to make a decision about whether to pay the ransom to save the child or complete the buyout. After a long night of contemplation Gondo announces that he will not pay the ransom, explaining that doing so would not only mean the loss of his position in the company, but cause him to go into debt and throw the futures of his wife and son into jeopardy. His plans are weakened when his top aide lets the \"cheap shoes\" faction know about the kidnapping in return for a promotion should they take over. Finally, after continuous pleading from the chauffeur and under pressure from his wife, Gondo decides to pay the ransom. Following the kidnapper's instructions, the money is put into two small briefcases and thrown out from a moving train; Shinichi is found unharmed.\nGondo is forced out of the company and his creditors demand the collateral in lieu of the debt. The story is widely reported however, making Gondo a hero, while the National Shoe Company is vilified and boycotted. Meanwhile, the police eventually find the hideout where Shinichi was kept prisoner. The bodies of the kidnapper's two accomplices are found there, killed by an overdose of heroin. The police surmise that the kidnapper engineered their deaths by supplying them with uncut drugs. Further clues lead to the identity of the kidnapper, a medical intern at a nearby hospital, but there is no hard evidence linking him to the accomplices' murders.\nThe police lay a trap by first planting a false story in the newspapers implying that the accomplices are still alive, and then forging a note from them demanding more drugs. The kidnapper is then apprehended in the act of trying to supply another lethal dose of uncut heroin to his accomplices, after testing the strength on a drug addict who overdoses and dies. Most of the ransom money is recovered, but too late to save Gondo's property from auction. With the kidnapper facing a death sentence, he requests to see Gondo while in prison and Gondo finally meets him face to face. Gondo has gone to work for a rival shoe company, earning less money but enjoying a free hand in running it. The kidnapper at first feigns no regrets for his actions.

The film foregrounds the modern infrastructure of the economic miracle years and the run-up to the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, including rapid rail lines and the proliferation of personal automobiles.\n\nWriting\nThe script originally ended with Inspector Tokura and Gondo having a conversation before Kurosawa changed his opinion in the edit.\n\nFilming\nPreparing for the scene wherein money is dropped through the open window of a Kodama express train the filmmakers made numerous enquiries to Japanese National Railways; unaware of the reason for their questions one official eventually asked \"Who are you people?\". The train was hired and the scene was shot while the train was running along the T\u014dkaid\u014d Line. Reportedly the actors rehearsed the scene on-set for a week before the one take. According to Teruyo Nogami, script supervisor on many of Kurosawa's films, claims that Kurosawa ordered the destruction of a private home because it was blocking the kidnapper actor's face are exaggerated. Instead a blue sheet was used to disguise alterations made to the second floor of a nearby building, a job conceived and executed just a day before filming took place.\nDuring the final scene, Yamazaki Tsutomu, playing the kidnapping mastermind, burnt his hands on the wire mesh from the heat of the lighting. The role launched him to acting success, appearing in two more of Kurosawa's films (Red Beard, and Kagemusha) and starring in the popular 1970s jidaigeki television drama Hissatsu Shiokinin.\nThe film is shot using CinemaScope, a widescreen filming system.\n\nEditing\nThe original script ending was changed when Kurosawa noted the performance of Yamazaki as especially powerful.\n\nSoundtrack\nScored by Masaru Sat\u014d, this was the eighth film he worked on with Akira Kurosawa, the film includes stock music from The H-Man (1958), the music of which was also produced by Sat\u014d.\n\nRelease\nTheatrical\nHigh and Low was released in Japan on 1 March 1963. In August of the same year it would be entered into the Venice Film Festival, being nominated for the Golden Lion although it would not see a general release in Italy for a few years afterwards. The film was released by Toho International with English subtitles in the United States on 26 November 1963. It received a wider release in Europe from 1967 onwards, premiering in the UK in April and Spain in July; but not in France until 1976.\n\nHome media\nThe Criterion Collection released the film on DVD on 14 October 1998 and again with updated picture and sound quality on 22 July 2008. A Blu-Ray version was released on 26 July 2011.\nThe BFI released a DVD of the film on 28 March 2005.\n\nReception\nUpon release in the United States, some critics questioned whether investigative techniques such as handwriting profiling and voiceprint analysis were possible in Japan at the time.\n\nBox office\nThe film was a box office success in Japan, garnering \u00a5460.2 million in ticket sales. The film was re-released in the USA in 2002 as part of the Kurosawa & Mifune festival; a multi-title release that in total accrued $561,692.\n\nCritical response\nContemporary reviews of the film achieved a positive consensus. The New York Times declared it to be \"one of the best detecting thrillers ever filmed,\" going on to commend the performance of Mifune and Nakadai and finally commenting, \"Mr. Kurosawa has composed a remarkable movie mosaic, both spine-tingling and compassionate\". The Washington Post wrote that \"High and Low is, in a way, the companion piece to Throne of Blood \u2013 it's Macbeth, if Macbeth had married better. The movie shares the rigors of Shakespeare's construction, the symbolic and historical sweep, the pacing that makes the story expand organically in the mind\". Stanley Kauffmann of The New Republic after asking why Kurosawa wanted to make High and Low, wrote \"To say all this is not, I hope, to discourage the reader from seeing this film. Very much the reverse. Two hours and twenty three minutes of fine entertainment are not a commonplace achievement. Also, from the opening frame (literally) to the last, Kurosawa never makes the smallest misstep nor permits it in anyone else\".\nScott Tobias of The AV Club commented on the film's split nature, seeing it as split in half between the indoor tension of negotiation at the beginning, and the race-against-time of the investigation to find the kidnapper. He praises Kurosawa for turning the \"mundane follow-through of police work into the stuff of white-knuckle suspense.\"\nDavid Parkinson writing for Empire in 2006 gave it four out of five stars, commenting on the film's use of \"deceptive appearance\" to illustrate that \"all men are essentially equal and the only thing that really separates them are the choices they make in the depths of a crisis.\"\nMartin Scorsese included it on a list of \"39 Essential Foreign Films for a Young Filmmaker.\"\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, High and Low has an approval rating of 96% based on 24 reviews, with an average score of 8\/10. In 2009 the film was voted at No. 13 on the list of The Greatest Japanese Films of All Time by Japanese film magazine Kinema Junpo.\n\nLegacy\nThe film is consistently ranked among Kurosawa's greatest works despite failing to achieve the same level of notoriety as Rashomon or Seven Samurai.\nIn emphasising the lenient sentencing of Japanese kidnapping law, High and Low is said to have been partially responsible for reform of the Penal Code in 1964.\n\nRemakes\nThe Indian film Inkaar (1977) has been described as a Bollywood reproduction of the film.\nThe film was adapted for Japanese TV in 2007 by Yasuo Tsuruhashi.\nThe story for the 2023 miniseries Full Circle was inspired by High and Low.\nApple Original Films announced on 8th February 2024, via X, that Spike Lee will be directing a reinterpretation, with Denzel Washington starring, in collaboration with A24. Filming starts in March of the same year.\n\nAwards and nominations\nVenice Film Festival (1964)\nNominated \u2013 Golden Lion \u2013 Akira Kurosawa\nMainichi Film Award (1963)\nWinner \u2013 Best Film\nWinner \u2013 Best Screenplay \u2013 Akira Kurosawa, Hideo Oguni, Eijir\u00f4 Hisaita, Ry\u00fbz\u00f4 Kikushima\n\nGolden Globe Awards (1964)\n\nNominated \u2013 Best Foreign Film\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\nHigh and Low (in Japanese) at the Japanese Movie Database\nHigh and Low at IMDb\nHigh and Low at the TCM Movie Database\nHigh and Low at AllMovie\nHigh and Low at Box Office Mojo\nHigh and Low at Rotten Tomatoes\nHigh and Low an essay by Chuck Stephens at the Criterion Collection\nHigh and Low: Between Heaven and Hell an essay by Geoffrey O'Brien at the Criterion Collection","84":"Hula Girls (\u30d5\u30e9\u30ac\u30fc\u30eb, Fura g\u0101ru) is a Japanese film, directed by Sang-il Lee and co-written by Lee and Daisuke Habara, and first released across Japanese theaters on September 23, 2006. Starring Y\u016b Aoi, Yasuko Matsuyuki, Etsushi Toyokawa, Shizuyo Yamazaki, Ittoku Kishibe, Eri Tokunaga, Yoko Ikezu and Sumiko Fuji, it is based on the real-life event of how a group of enthusiastic girls take on hula dancing to save their small mining village, Iwaki, helping the formation of Joban Hawaiian Center (now known as Spa Resort Hawaiians), which was later to become one of Japan's most popular theme parks. It received its premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival.\nHula Girls was critically acclaimed upon release in Japan and nominated for a total of 12 awards at the 2007 Japan Academy Awards, going on to win five major awards, including that of best film, best director, best screenplay, best supporting actress (for Y\u016b Aoi), and most popular film. It also won two major awards at the 80th Kinema Junpo awards, including that of best film and best supporting actress (for Y\u016b Aoi). Since its release in Japan, the film has been shown across theaters and film festivals worldwide.\n\nStory\nIn 1965, the cold, northern  coal mining town of Iwaki, was facing unemployment due to oil becoming the predominant energy resource in Japan.\nThe mining company develops a plan to use hot springs, which seeped into the mines, to provide heat for a Hawaiian Center spa resort.  The plan is greeted with hostility by the miners, but the company recruits Madoka Hirayama (Matsuyuki) a down-on-her-luck dance instructor from Tokyo to train local girls in the hula.\nAt first, only a small core group take the challenge.  Sanae (Tokunaga) is worried that her widowed father will lose his job, and the ability to support the four kids.  She convinces her lifelong best friend Kimiko (Aoi) to join her at the disastrous first meeting.  After the rumor runs through attendees that they will be dancing topless, Sanae and Kimiko seem to be the only two listening to the assurances that the rumor is false, as dozens of their companions flee.  The two girls are joined by Hatsuko (Ikezu), the organizer's secretary, and Sayuri (Yamazaki), a large clumsy girl.\nThings go poorly as training begins, and a frustrated Hirayama nearly gives up, until the girls' enthusiasm persuades her to give the plan another try.\nKimiko and her mother, Chiyo (Fuji), have an argument, which prompts the girl to leave home to stay at the school, but as training continues and local unemployment looms, some of the other girls come back and join the school.\nOn the day that Sanae's father is fired, he comes home to find her in Hawaiian costume, and beats her. This outrages Hirayama, who attacks him. When he leaves, Sanae goes with him to take care of her siblings, after getting Kimiko, who has become the leader of the girls, to promise that she will keep going.\nCrushed by the departure of her friend, Kimiko finds it impossible to maintain the focus needed in dancing, but is told the show must go on. She does not accept this until her brother (Toyokawa) tells her to see it through. She pulls herself together in time to join the publicity tour.\nAfter a disastrous first performance in the tour, the girls come together as a team and the tour is a great success, until a mine accident in which Sayuri's father is caught.  Told of the accident just before the last planned performance, the troupe prepares to leave for home.  Knowing that her father wants her to succeed, Sayuri begs for the chance to finish the tour.  The bus pulls into town hours after Sayuri's father dies, and as distraught family and friends berate her, Hirayama claims responsibility for not returning immediately, accepting another failure in her career. Her students, however, refuse to let her leave.\nHowever, the imported palm trees are threatened by cold weather.  A package from Sanae arrives for Kimiko. Her mother, Chiyo, brings it to the dance studio, where she sees the skills her daughter has gained. Chiyo collects stoves to give her daughter the chance to live her dream. She even attends the opening night of the show, at which Kimiko wears the flower sent by Sanae.\nThe opening show is a great success, establishing the Joban Hawaiian Center as a tourist destination.\n\nLocations featured in film\nFukushima Prefecture\nIwaki\nFurudono, Ishikawa District\nSpa Resort Hawaiians (actual spa resort located in Iwaki)\nIbaraki Prefecture\nKitaibaraki\nTakahagi\nNakaminato Station (located in Hitachinaka)\n\nAwards\nHula Girls won several awards upon release, including five major awards at the 2007 Japan Academy Awards, including that of best film, best director, best screenplay, best supporting actress (for Y\u016b Aoi), and most popular film.

The film is about an elderly Japanese factory owner so terrified of the prospect of a nuclear attack that he becomes determined to move his entire extended family to what he imagines is the safety of a farm in Brazil.\nThe film stars Kurosawa regulars Toshiro Mifune and Takashi Shimura, and is the director's last with composer Fumio Hayasaka, who died while working on it. It is in black-and-white and runs 103 minutes. The film was entered into the 1956 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nPlot\nKiichi Nakajima (Toshiro Mifune) is an elderly foundry owner who is convinced he and his loved ones will all be killed in an imminent nuclear war if they stay in Japan, so he resolves to move them to perceived safety in Brazil. He does not care that no one else wants to go or that it might make things awkward that he wants to bring his three illegitimate children and two surviving mistresses along with his wife and the four children they have together, saying that nothing is more important than their continued survival.\nKiichi's three oldest children convince his wife to try to have him ruled incompetent in order to keep him from wasting their inheritance on his plan, and they bring him before a three-man arbitration panel that includes Dr. Harada (Takashi Shimura). Harada, a dentist who volunteers with the family court, sympathizes with Kiichi's concerns and points out that the fear of nuclear weapons is present in every citizen of Japan. He wonders aloud whether it may be wrong to rule someone incompetent simply for being more worried than the average citizen, but the panel eventually decides that Kiichi's irrational behavior justifies removing his ability to make the financial decisions for his family by himself.\nAfter this, Kiichi tries to find a way to move forward with the move anyway, but his efforts fail, and his mental state begins to deteriorate more rapidly once he no longer feels as though he is doing anything to save himself and his family from the nuclear holocaust he is sure is coming. Growing increasingly desperate, he decides that his family will be willing to go with him to South America if they no longer have jobs or a source of income tying them to Japan, and he burns down the foundry. When this is discovered, his distress reaches a breaking point after some of his employees point out that his actions indicate he is unconcerned about their lives and his son-in-law argues that there are already more than enough nuclear weapons to destroy all life on this planet and nowhere is really safe.\nHarada goes to visit Kiichi at the psychiatric facility to which he has been sent. While waiting to be shown to his room, Harada talks with a psychologist, who remarks that he has found Kiichi's case particularly troubling personally, since it has made him wonder whether it may be more insane to ignore the nuclear threat than it is to take it too seriously. Harada discovers that Kiichi believes he has escaped to another planet and that he has become severely withdrawn from his surroundings. During their visit, however, Kiichi becomes agitated when he sees the Sun through his window and thinks it is the Earth burning.\n\nCast\nProduction\nI Live in Fear was the last film that composer Fumio Hayasaka worked on before dying of tuberculosis in 1955. He had been Akira Kurosawa's close friend since Drunken Angel in 1948 and collaborated with him on several films. The composer and director collaborated to test \"oppositional handling of music and performance\" and, in Something Like an Autobiography, Kurosawa would say that working with Hayasaka changed his views on how film music should be used; from then on, he viewed music as \"counterpoint\" to the image and not just an accompaniment. Kurosawa recalled that it was a conversation with Hayasaka about nuclear weapons in the wake of the H-bomb test accident of 1954 that inspired the plot of I Live in Fear. Masaru Sato, Hayasaka's pupil, wrote that he completed the film's score.\n\nRelease\nThe film was screened in conjunction with the first New York Film Festival at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City in 1963. Vincent Canby felt that the \"major flaw of the film is that one never quite believes - or understands - the sincerity of the old man\" and claimed that the English subtitles were barely acceptable.\n\nReissues\nThe Criterion Collection has released I Live in Fear on DVD in North America as part of two Kurosawa-centered box sets; 2008's Postwar Kurosawa, the seventh entry in their Eclipse series, and 2009's AK 100: 25 Films by Akira Kurosawa.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nI Live in Fear at Rotten Tomatoes\nI Live in Fear at IMDb\nI Live in Fear (in Japanese) at the Japanese Movie Database\nI Live in Fear at AllMovie","87":"The International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is a numeric commercial book identifier that is intended to be unique. Publishers purchase or receive ISBNs from an affiliate of the International ISBN Agency.\nA different ISBN is assigned to each separate edition and variation of a publication, but not to a simple reprinting of an existing item. For example, an e-book, a paperback and a hardcover edition of the same book must each have a different ISBN, but an unchanged reprint of the hardcover edition keeps the same ISBN. The ISBN is ten digits long if assigned before 2007, and thirteen digits long if assigned on or after 1 January 2007. The method of assigning an ISBN is nation-specific and varies between countries, often depending on how large the publishing industry is within a country.\nThe first version of the ISBN identification format was devised in 1967, based upon the 9-digit Standard Book Numbering (SBN) created in 1966. The 10-digit ISBN format was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and was published in 1970 as international standard ISO 2108 (any 9-digit SBN can be converted to a 10-digit ISBN by prefixing it with a zero).\nPrivately published books sometimes appear without an ISBN. The International ISBN Agency sometimes assigns ISBNs to such books on its own initiative.\nA separate identifier code of a similar kind, the International Standard Serial Number (ISSN), identifies periodical publications such as magazines and newspapers. The International Standard Music Number (ISMN) covers musical scores.\n\nHistory\nThe Standard Book Number (SBN) is a commercial system using nine-digit code numbers to identify books. In 1965, British bookseller and stationers WHSmith announced plans to implement a standard numbering system for its books. They hired consultants to work on their behalf, and the system was devised by Gordon Foster, emeritus professor of statistics at Trinity College Dublin. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Technical Committee on Documentation sought to adapt the British SBN for international use. The ISBN identification format was conceived in 1967 in the United Kingdom by David Whitaker (regarded as the \"Father of the ISBN\") and in 1968 in the United States by Emery Koltay (who later became director of the U.S. ISBN agency R. R. Bowker).\nThe 10-digit ISBN format was developed by the ISO and was published in 1970 as international standard ISO 2108. The United Kingdom continued to use the nine-digit SBN code until 1974. ISO has appointed the International ISBN Agency as the registration authority for ISBN worldwide and the ISBN Standard is developed under the control of ISO Technical Committee 46\/Subcommittee 9 TC 46\/SC 9. The ISO on-line facility only refers back to 1978.\n\nAn SBN may be converted to an ISBN by prefixing the digit \"0\". For example, the second edition of Mr. J. G. Reeder Returns, published by Hodder in 1965, has \"SBN 340 01381 8\", where \"340\" indicates the publisher, \"01381\" is the serial number assigned by the publisher, and \"8\" is the check digit. By prefixing a zero, this can be converted to ISBN 0-340-01381-8; the check digit does not need to be re-calculated. Some publishers, such as Ballantine Books, would sometimes use 12-digit SBNs where the last three digits indicated the price of the book; for example, Woodstock Handmade Houses had a 12-digit Standard Book Number of 345-24223-8-595 (valid SBN: 345-24223-8, ISBN: 0-345-24223-8), and it cost US$5.95.\nSince 1 January 2007, ISBNs have contained thirteen digits, a format that is compatible with \"Bookland\" European Article Numbers, which have 13 digits.\nThe United States, with 3.9 million registered ISBNs in 2020, was by far the biggest user of the ISBN identifier in 2020, followed by the Republic of Korea (329,582), Germany (284,000), China (263,066), the UK (188,553) and Indonesia (144,793). Lifetime ISBNs registered in the United States are over 39 million as of 2020.\n\nOverview\nA separate ISBN is assigned to each edition and variation (except reprintings) of a publication. For example, an ebook, audiobook, paperback, and hardcover edition of the same book must each have a different ISBN assigned to it.:\u200a12\u200a The ISBN is thirteen digits long if assigned on or after 1 January 2007, and ten digits long if assigned before 2007. An International Standard Book Number consists of four parts (if it is a 10-digit ISBN) or five parts (for a 13-digit ISBN).\nSection 5 of the International ISBN Agency's official user manual:\u200a11\u200a describes the structure of the 13-digit ISBN, as follows:\n\nfor a 13-digit ISBN, a prefix element \u2013 a GS1 prefix: so far 978 or 979 have been made available by GS1,\nthe registration group element (language-sharing country group, individual country or territory),\nthe registrant element,\nthe publication element, and\na checksum character or check digit.\nA 13-digit ISBN can be separated into its parts (prefix element, registration group, registrant, publication and check digit), and when this is done it is customary to separate the parts with hyphens or spaces. Separating the parts (registration group, registrant, publication and check digit) of a 10-digit ISBN is also done with either hyphens or spaces. Figuring out how to correctly separate a given ISBN is complicated, because most of the parts do not use a fixed number of digits.\n\nIssuing process\nISBN issuance is country-specific, in that ISBNs are issued by the ISBN registration agency that is responsible for that country or territory regardless of the publication language. The ranges of ISBNs assigned to any particular country are based on the publishing profile of the country concerned, and so the ranges will vary depending on the number of books and the number, type, and size of publishers that are active. Some ISBN registration agencies are based in national libraries or within ministries of culture and thus may receive direct funding from the government to support their services. In other cases, the ISBN registration service is provided by organisations such as bibliographic data providers that are not government funded.\nA full directory of ISBN agencies is available on the International ISBN Agency website. A list for a few countries is given below:\n\nAustralia \u2013 Thorpe-Bowker\nBrazil \u2013 The National Library of Brazil; (Up to 28 February 2020)\nBrazil \u2013 C\u00e2mara Brasileira do Livro (From 1 March 2020)\nCanada \u2013 English Library and Archives Canada, a government agency; French Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives nationales du Qu\u00e9bec;\nColombia \u2013 C\u00e1mara Colombiana del Libro, an NGO\nHong Kong \u2013 Books Registration Office (BRO), under the Hong Kong Public Libraries\nIceland \u2013 Landsb\u00f3kasafn (National and University Library of Iceland)\nIndia \u2013 The Raja Rammohun Roy National Agency for ISBN (Book Promotion and Copyright Division), under Department of Higher Education, a constituent of the Ministry of Human Resource Development\nIsrael \u2013 The Israel Center for Libraries\nItaly \u2013 EDISER srl, owned by Associazione Italiana Editori (Italian Publishers Association)\nKenya \u2013 National Library of Kenya\nLatvia - Latvian ISBN Agency\nLebanon \u2013 Lebanese ISBN Agency\nMaldives \u2013 The National Bureau of Classification (NBC)\nMalta \u2013 The National Book Council (Maltese: Il-Kunsill Nazzjonali tal-Ktieb)\nMorocco \u2013 The National Library of Morocco\nNew Zealand \u2013 The National Library of New Zealand\nNigeria \u2013 National Library of Nigeria\nPakistan \u2013 National Library of Pakistan\nPhilippines \u2013 National Library of the Philippines\nSouth Africa \u2013 National Library of South Africa\nSpain \u2013 Spanish ISBN Agency \u2013 Agencia del ISBN\nTurkey \u2013 General Directorate of Libraries and Publications, a branch of the Ministry of Culture\nUnited Kingdom and Republic of Ireland \u2013 Nielsen Book Services Ltd, part of NIQ\nUnited States \u2013 R. R. Bowker\n\nRegistration group element\nThe ISBN registration group element is a 1-to-5-digit number that is valid within a single prefix element (i.e. one of 978 or 979),:\u200a11\u200a and can be separated between hyphens, such as \"978-1-...\". Registration groups have primarily been allocated within the 978 prefix element. The single-digit registration groups within the 978-prefix element are: 0 or 1 for English-speaking countries; 2 for French-speaking countries; 3 for German-speaking countries; 4 for Japan; 5 for Russian-speaking countries; and 7 for People's Republic of China. Example 5-digit registration groups are 99936 and 99980, for Bhutan. The allocated registration groups are: 0\u20135, 600\u2013631, 65, 7, 80\u201394, 950\u2013989, 9910\u20139989, and 99901\u201399993. Books published in rare languages typically have longer group elements.\nWithin the 979 prefix element, the registration group 0 is reserved for compatibility with International Standard Music Numbers (ISMNs), but such material is not actually assigned an ISBN. The registration groups within prefix element 979 that have been assigned are 8 for the United States of America, 10 for France, 11 for the Republic of Korea, and 12 for Italy.\nThe original 9-digit standard book number (SBN) had no registration group identifier, but prefixing a zero to a 9-digit SBN creates a valid 10-digit ISBN.\n\nRegistrant element\nThe national ISBN agency assigns the registrant element (cf. Category:ISBN agencies) and an accompanying series of ISBNs within that registrant element to the publisher; the publisher then allocates one of the ISBNs to each of its books. In most countries, a book publisher is not legally required to assign an ISBN, although most large bookstores only handle publications that have ISBNs assigned to them.\nThe International ISBN Agency maintains the details of over one million ISBN prefixes and publishers in the Global Register of Publishers. This database is freely searchable over the internet.\nPublishers receive blocks of ISBNs, with larger blocks allotted to publishers expecting to need them; a small publisher may receive ISBNs of one or more digits for the registration group identifier, several digits for the registrant, and a single digit for the publication element. Once that block of ISBNs is used, the publisher may receive another block of ISBNs, with a different registrant element. Consequently, a publisher may have different allotted registrant elements. There also may be more than one registration group identifier used in a country. This might occur once all the registrant elements from a particular registration group have been allocated to publishers.\nBy using variable block lengths, registration agencies are able to customise the allocations of ISBNs that they make to publishers. For example, a large publisher may be given a block of ISBNs where fewer digits are allocated for the registrant element and many digits are allocated for the publication element; likewise, countries publishing many titles have few allocated digits for the registration group identifier and many for the registrant and publication elements. Here are some sample ISBN-10 codes, illustrating block length variations.\n\nEnglish-language pattern\nEnglish-language registration group elements are 0 and 1 (2 of more than 220 registration group elements). These two registration group elements are divided into registrant elements in a systematic pattern, which allows their length to be determined, as follows:\n\nCheck digits\nA check digit is a form of redundancy check used for error detection, the decimal equivalent of a binary check bit. It consists of a single digit computed from the other digits in the number. The method for the 10-digit ISBN is an extension of that for SBNs, so the two systems are compatible; an SBN prefixed with a zero (the 10-digit ISBN) will give the same check digit as the SBN without the zero. The check digit is base eleven, and can be an integer between 0 and 9, or an 'X'. The system for 13-digit ISBNs is not compatible with SBNs and will, in general, give a different check digit from the corresponding 10-digit ISBN, so does not provide the same protection against transposition. This is because the 13-digit code was required to be compatible with the EAN format, and hence could not contain the letter 'X'.\n\nISBN-10 check digits\nAccording to the 2001 edition of the International ISBN Agency's official user manual, the ISBN-10 check digit (which is the last digit of the 10-digit ISBN) must range from 0 to 10 (the symbol 'X' is used for 10), and must be such that the sum of the ten digits, each multiplied by its (integer) weight, descending from 10 to 1, is a multiple of 11. That is, if xi is the ith digit, then x10 must be chosen such that:\n\nFor example, for an ISBN-10 of 0-306-40615-2:\n\nFormally, using modular arithmetic, this is rendered\n\nIt is also true for ISBN-10s that the sum of all ten digits, each multiplied by its weight in ascending order from 1 to 10, is a multiple of 11. For this example:\n\nFormally, this is rendered\n\nThe two most common errors in handling an ISBN (e.g. when typing it or writing it down) are a single altered digit or the transposition of adjacent digits. It can be proven mathematically that all pairs of valid ISBN-10s differ in at least two digits. It can also be proven that there are no pairs of valid ISBN-10s with eight identical digits and two transposed digits (these proofs are true because the ISBN is less than eleven digits long and because 11 is a prime number). The ISBN check digit method therefore ensures that it will always be possible to detect these two most common types of error, i.e., if either of these types of error has occurred, the result will never be a valid ISBN\u2014the sum of the digits multiplied by their weights will never be a multiple of 11. However, if the error were to occur in the publishing house and remain undetected, the book would be issued with an invalid ISBN.\nIn contrast, it is possible for other types of error, such as two altered non-transposed digits, or three altered digits, to result in a valid ISBN (although it is still unlikely).\n\nISBN-10 check digit calculation\nEach of the first nine digits of the 10-digit ISBN\u2014excluding the check digit itself\u2014is multiplied by its (integer) weight, descending from 10 to 2, and the sum of these nine products found. The value of the check digit is simply the one number between 0 and 10 which, when added to this sum, means the total is a multiple of 11.\nFor example, the check digit for an ISBN-10 of 0-306-40615-? is calculated as follows:\n\nAdding 2 to 130 gives a multiple of 11 (because 132 = 12\u00d711)\u2014this is the only number between 0 and 10 which does so. Therefore, the check digit has to be 2, and the complete sequence is ISBN 0-306-40615-2. If the value of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            10\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{10}}\n  \n required to satisfy this condition is 10, then an 'X' should be used.\nAlternatively, modular arithmetic is convenient for calculating the check digit using modulus 11. The remainder of this sum when it is divided by 11 (i.e. its value modulo 11), is computed. This remainder plus the check digit must equal either 0 or 11. Therefore, the check digit is (11 minus the remainder of the sum of the products modulo 11) modulo 11. Taking the remainder modulo 11 a second time accounts for the possibility that the first remainder is 0. Without the second modulo operation, the calculation could result in a check digit value of 11 \u2212 0 = 11, which is invalid. (Strictly speaking, the first \"modulo 11\" is not needed, but it may be considered to simplify the calculation.)\nFor example, the check digit for the ISBN of 0-306-40615-? is calculated as follows:\n\nThus the check digit is 2.\nIt is possible to avoid the multiplications in a software implementation by using two accumulators. Repeatedly adding t into s computes the necessary multiples:\n\nThe modular reduction can be done once at the end, as shown above (in which case s could hold a value as large as 496, for the invalid ISBN 99999-999-9-X), or s and t could be reduced by a conditional subtract after each addition.\n\nISBN-13 check digit calculation\nAppendix 1 of the International ISBN Agency's official user manual:\u200a33\u200a describes how the 13-digit ISBN check digit is calculated. The ISBN-13 check digit, which is the last digit of the ISBN, must range from 0 to 9 and must be such that the sum of all the thirteen digits, each multiplied by its (integer) weight, alternating between 1 and 3, is a multiple of 10. As ISBN-13 is a subset of EAN-13, the algorithm for calculating the check digit is exactly the same for both.\nFormally, using modular arithmetic, this is rendered:\n\nThe calculation of an ISBN-13 check digit begins with the first twelve digits of the 13-digit ISBN (thus excluding the check digit itself). Each digit, from left to right, is alternately multiplied by 1 or 3, then those products are summed modulo 10 to give a value ranging from 0 to 9. Subtracted from 10, that leaves a result from 1 to 10. A zero replaces a ten, so, in all cases, a single check digit results.\nFor example, the ISBN-13 check digit of 978-0-306-40615-? is calculated as follows:\n\ns = 9\u00d71 + 7\u00d73 + 8\u00d71 + 0\u00d73 + 3\u00d71 + 0\u00d73 + 6\u00d71 + 4\u00d73 + 0\u00d71 + 6\u00d73 + 1\u00d71 + 5\u00d73\n  =   9 +  21 +   8 +   0 +   3 +   0 +   6 +  12 +   0 +  18 +   1 +  15\n  = 93\n93 \/ 10 = 9 remainder 3\n10 \u2013  3 = 7\n\nThus, the check digit is 7, and the complete sequence is ISBN 978-0-306-40615-7.\nIn general, the ISBN check digit is calculated as follows.\nLet\n\nThen\n\nThis check system\u2014similar to the UPC check digit formula\u2014does not catch all errors of adjacent digit transposition. Specifically, if the difference between two adjacent digits is 5, the check digit will not catch their transposition. For instance, the above example allows this situation with the 6 followed by a 1. The correct order contributes 3 \u00d7 6 + 1 \u00d7 1 = 19 to the sum; while, if the digits are transposed (1 followed by a 6), the contribution of those two digits will be 3 \u00d7 1 + 1 \u00d7 6 = 9. However, 19 and 9 are congruent modulo 10, and so produce the same, final result: both ISBNs will have a check digit of 7. The ISBN-10 formula uses the prime modulus 11 which avoids this blind spot, but requires more than the digits 0\u20139 to express the check digit.\nAdditionally, if the sum of the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th digits is tripled then added to the remaining digits (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, and 13th), the total will always be divisible by 10 (i.e., end in 0).\n\nISBN-10 to ISBN-13 conversion\nA 10-digit ISBN is converted to a 13-digit ISBN by prepending \"978\" to the  ISBN-10 and recalculating the final checksum digit using the ISBN-13 algorithm. The reverse process can also be performed, but not for numbers commencing with a prefix other than 978, which have no 10-digit equivalent.\n\nErrors in usage\nPublishers and libraries have varied policies about the use of the ISBN check digit. Publishers sometimes fail to check the correspondence of a book title and its ISBN before publishing it; that failure causes book identification problems for libraries, booksellers, and readers. For example, ISBN 0-590-76484-5 is shared by two books\u2014Ninja gaiden: a novel based on the best-selling game by Tecmo (1990) and Wacky laws (1997), both published by Scholastic.\nMost libraries and booksellers display the book record for an invalid ISBN issued by the publisher. The Library of Congress catalogue contains books published with invalid ISBNs, which it usually tags with the phrase \"Cancelled ISBN\". The International Union Library Catalog (a.k.a., WorldCat OCLC\u2014Online Computer Library Center system) often indexes by invalid ISBNs, if the book is indexed in that way by a member library.\n\neISBN\nOnly the term \"ISBN\" should be used; the terms \"eISBN\" and \"e-ISBN\" have historically been sources of confusion and should be avoided. If a book exists in one or more digital (e-book) formats, each of those formats must have its own ISBN. In other words, each of the three separate EPUB, Amazon Kindle, and PDF formats of a particular book will have its own specific ISBN. They should not share the ISBN of the paper version, and there is no generic \"eISBN\" which encompasses all the e-book formats for a title.\n\nEAN format used in barcodes, and upgrading\nThe barcodes on a book's back cover (or inside a mass-market paperback book's front cover) are EAN-13; they may have a separate barcode encoding five digits called an EAN-5 for the currency and the recommended retail price. For 10-digit ISBNs, the number \"978\", the Bookland \"country code\", is prefixed to the ISBN in the barcode data, and the check digit is recalculated according to the EAN-13 formula (modulo 10, 1\u00d7 and 3\u00d7 weighting on alternating digits).\nPartly because of an expected shortage in certain ISBN categories, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) decided to migrate to a 13-digit ISBN (ISBN-13). The process began on 1 January 2005 and was planned to conclude on 1 January 2007. As of 2011, all the 13-digit ISBNs began with 978. As the 978 ISBN supply is exhausted, the 979 prefix was introduced. Part of the 979 prefix is reserved for use with the Musicland code for musical scores with an ISMN. The 10-digit ISMN codes differed visually as they began with an \"M\" letter; the bar code represents the \"M\" as a zero, and for checksum purposes it counted as a 3. All ISMNs are now thirteen digits commencing 979-0; 979-1 to 979-9 will be used by ISBN.\nPublisher identification code numbers are unlikely to be the same in the 978 and 979 ISBNs, likewise, there is no guarantee that language area code numbers will be the same. Moreover, the 10-digit ISBN check digit generally is not the same as the 13-digit ISBN check digit. Because the GTIN-13 is part of the Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) system (that includes the GTIN-14, the GTIN-12, and the GTIN-8), the 13-digit ISBN falls within the 14-digit data field range.\nBarcode format compatibility is maintained, because (aside from the group breaks) the ISBN-13 barcode format is identical to the EAN barcode format of existing 10-digit ISBNs. So, migration to an EAN-based system allows booksellers the use of a single numbering system for both books and non-book products that is compatible with existing ISBN based data, with only minimal changes to information technology systems. Hence, many booksellers (e.g., Barnes & Noble) migrated to EAN barcodes as early as March 2005. Although many American and Canadian booksellers were able to read EAN-13 barcodes before 2005, most general retailers could not read them. The upgrading of the UPC barcode system to full EAN-13, in 2005, eased migration to the ISBN in North America.\n\nSee also\nASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number)\nBICI (Book Item and Component Identifier)\nBook sources search \u2013 a Wikipedia resource that allows search by ISBNs\nCODEN (serial publication identifier currently used by libraries; replaced by the ISSN for new works)\nDOI (Digital Object Identifier)\nESTC (English Short Title Catalogue)\nISAN (International Standard Audiovisual Number)\nISRC (International Standard Recording Code)\nISTC (International Standard Text Code)\nISWC (International Standard Musical Work Code)\nISSN (International Standard Serial Number)\nISWN (International Standard Wine Number)\nLCCN (Library of Congress Control Number)\nLicense number (East German books) (Book identification system used between 1951 and 1990 in the former GDR)\nList of group-0 ISBN publisher codes\nList of group-1 ISBN publisher codes\nList of ISBN registration groups\nSICI (Serial Item and Contribution Identifier)\nVD 16 (Verzeichnis der im deutschen Sprachbereich erschienenen Drucke des 16.

IMDb began as a fan-operated movie database on the Usenet group \"rec.arts.movies\" in 1990, and moved to the Web in 1993. Since 1998, it has been owned and operated by IMDb.com, Inc., a subsidiary of Amazon.\nThe site's message boards were disabled in February 2017.\nAs of 2019, IMDb was the 52nd most visited website on the Internet, as ranked by Alexa. As of March 2022, the database contained some 10.1 million titles (including television episodes), 11.5 million person records, and 83 million registered users.\n\nFeatures\nThe title and talent pages of IMDb are accessible to all users, but only registered and logged-in users can submit new material and suggest edits to existing entries. Most of the site's data has been provided by these volunteers. Registered users with a proven track record are able to add and make corrections to cast lists, credits, and some other data points. However, the addition and removal of images, and alterations to titles, cast and crew names, character names, and plot summaries are subject to an approval process; this usually takes between 24 and 72 hours.\nOn October 2, 2007, character filmographies were added. Character entries are created from character listings in the main filmography database, and as such do not need any additional verification by IMDb staff. They have already been verified when they are added to the main filmography.\nRegistered users can choose their username, and most are pseudonymous. There is no single index of contributors, no index on each profile page of the items contributed, and\u2014except for plot synopses and biographies\u2014no identification of contributors to each product's or person's data pages. Users are also invited to rate titles on a scale of 1 to 10, and the totals are converted into a weighted mean-rating, with filters in place to mitigate ballot-stuffing.\nUser profile pages show a user's registration date and, optionally, their personal ratings of titles. Since 2015, \"badges\" can be added showing a count of contributions. These badges range from total contributions made to independent categories such as photos, trivia, and biographies. If a registered user or visitor is in the entertainment industry and has an IMDb page, they can add photos through IMDbPRO.\n\nUser ratings of films\nAs one adjunct to data, the IMDb offers a rating scale that allows users to rate titles on a scale of one to ten.\nIMDb indicates that submitted ratings are filtered and weighted in various ways to produce a weighted mean that is displayed for each title. It states that filters are used to deter ballot stuffing; the methodology and details for how its ratings are calculated are confidential and not accessible to the public. In fact, it sometimes produces an extreme difference between the weighted average and the arithmetic mean.\n\nRankings\nThe IMDb Top 250 is a list of the top rated 250 films, based on ratings by the registered users of the website using the methods described. As of 5 September 2023, The Shawshank Redemption, directed by Frank Darabont, is No. 1 on the list, and has been since 2008. The \"Top 250\" rating is based on only the ratings of \"regular voters\". The number of votes a registered user would have to make to be considered as a user who votes regularly has been kept secret. IMDb has stated that to maintain the effectiveness of the Top 250 list they \"deliberately do not disclose the criteria used for a person to be counted as a regular voter\". In addition to other weightings, the Top 250 films are also based on a weighted rating formula referred to in actuarial science as a credibility formula. This label arises because a statistic is taken to be more credible the greater the number of individual pieces of information; in this case from eligible users who submit ratings. Although the current formula is not disclosed, IMDb originally used the following formula to calculate their weighted rating:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        W\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n               \n              R\n              \u22c5\n              v\n              +\n              C\n              \u22c5\n              m\n               \n            \n            \n              v\n              +\n              m\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W={\\frac {\\ R\\cdot v+C\\cdot m\\ }{v+m}}}\n  \n\nwhere:\n\nW is the weighted rating;\nR is the mean rating for the movie, from 1 to 10;\nv is the number of votes for the movie;\nm is the minimum votes required to be listed in the Top 250 (25,000 as of 2013)\nC is the mean vote across the whole report (7.0 as of 2013).\nThe variable W in this formula is equivalent to a Bayesian posterior mean (see Bayesian statistics).\nThe IMDb also has a Bottom 100 feature which is assembled through a similar process although only 10,000 votes must be received to qualify for the list.\nThe Top 250 list comprises a wide range of feature films, including major releases, cult films, independent films, critically acclaimed films, silent films, and non-English-language films. Documentaries, short films and TV episodes are not currently included.\nSince 2015, there has been a Top 250 list devoted to ranking television shows.\n\nReference view\nIMDb originally used a more sidebar\/list-based view on title pages. However, in 2010 the site updated pages to more free-flowing layouts, and offered logged-in users an \"advanced view\" site preference setting called \"Combined view\", or this could be done on an ad-hoc basis by simply adding \/combined to the end of the URL (e.g. https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt2358891\/combined), for users to choose should they prefer the older page view display method or to aid the editing of data.\nIn 2017, some alterations were made to this advanced view, and the setting was renamed \"Reference view\", again also able to be accessed ad-hoc by simply adding \/reference to the end of the URL (e.g. https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt2358891\/reference), with the former \/combined URLs made to link to the newer \/reference ones.\n\nMessage boards\nBeginning in 2001, the Internet Movie Database also maintained message boards for every title (excepting, as of 2013, TV episodes, which used the same message board for the whole series) and name entry, along with over 140 main boards. To post on the message boards a user needed to \"authenticate\" their account via cell phone, credit card, or by having been a recent customer of the parent company Amazon.com. Message boards expanded in recent years. The Soapbox started in 1999 as a general message board meant for debates on any subjects. The Politics board started in 2007 was a message board to discuss politics, news events, and current affairs, as well as history and economics.\nBy February 20, 2017, all the message boards and their content were permanently removed. According to the website, the decision was made because the boards were \"no longer providing a positive, useful experience for the vast majority of our more than 250 million monthly users worldwide\". Others have mentioned its susceptibility to trolling and disagreeable behavior. Needham also mentioned in a post some months earlier that the boards received less income from ads, and that their members only made up a very small part of the website's visitors. The boards were costly to run due to the system's age and dated design, which did not make business sense. The decision to remove the message boards was met with outspoken backlash from some of its users, and sparked an online petition garnering over 8,000 signatures. In the days leading up to February 20, 2017, both Archive.org and MovieChat.org preserved the entire contents of the IMDb message boards using web scraping. Archive.org and MovieChat.org have published IMDb message board archives.\n\nIMDbPro\nActors, crew, and industry executives can post their own resume and upload photos of themselves for a yearly membership fee to IMDbPro. IMDbPro can be accessed by anyone willing to pay the annual fee of US$149.99. Membership enables a user to access the rank order of each industry personality, as well as agent contact information for any actor, producer, director etc. that has an IMDb page. IMDbPro also allows existing actors to claim their name page, as well as production companies to claim titles they own\/manage. Enrolling in IMDbPro enables members who are industry personnel to upload a head shot to open their page, as well as to upload hundreds of photos to accompany their page. Anyone can register as an IMDb user and contribute to the site as well as view its content; however, those users enrolled in IMDbPro have greater access and privileges.\n\nHistory\nPre-website\nIMDb originated in 1990 with a Usenet posting entitled \"Those Eyes\", by the English film fan and computer programmer Col Needham,  about actresses with beautiful eyes. Others with similar interests soon responded with additions or different lists of their own. Needham subsequently started an \"Actors List\", while Dave Knight began a \"Directors List\", and Andy Krieg took over \"THE LIST\" from Cody Phillips, which would later be renamed the \"Actress List\". Both lists had been restricted to people who were alive and working, but soon retired people were added, so Needham started what was then (but did not remain) a separate \"Dead Actors\/Actresses List\". Steve Hammond started collecting and merging character names for both the actors and actresses lists. When these achieved popularity, they were merged back into the lists themselves. The goal of the participants now was to make the lists as inclusive as possible.\nBy late 1990, the lists included almost 10,000 films and television series, correlated with actors and actresses appearing therein. On October 17, 1990, Needham developed and posted a collection of Unix shell scripts that could be used to search the four lists, and thus the database that would become the IMDb was born. At the time, it was known as the \"rec.arts.movies movie database\".\n\nOn the Web\nThe database had been expanded to include additional categories of filmmakers and other demographic material as well as trivia, biographies, and plot summaries. The movie ratings had been properly integrated with the list data, and a centralized email interface for querying the database had been created by Alan Jay. Later, on August 5, 1993, it moved onto the fledgling World Wide Web under the name of Cardiff Internet Movie Database. The database resided on the servers of the computer science department of Cardiff University in Wales. Rob Hartill was the original web interface author. In 1994, the email interface was revised to accept the submission of all information, which enabled people to email the specific list maintainer with their updates. However, the structure remained so that information received on a single film was divided among multiple section managers, the sections being defined and determined by categories of film personnel and the individual filmographies contained therein. Over the next few years, the database was run on a network of mirrors across the world with donated bandwidth.\n\nAs an independent company\nIn 1996 IMDb was incorporated in the United Kingdom, becoming the Internet Movie Database Ltd. Founder Col Needham became the primary owner. General revenue for site operations was generated through advertising, licensing and partnerships.\n\nAs Amazon.com subsidiary (1998\u2013present)\nIn 1998, Jeff Bezos, founder, owner, and CEO of Amazon.com, struck a deal with Needham and other principal shareholders to buy IMDb outright; Amazon paid $55 million for IMDb and two other companies. Bezos attached it to Amazon as a subsidiary, private company. This gave IMDb the ability to pay the shareholders salaries for their work. In the process of expanding its product line, Amazon.com intended to use IMDb as an advertising resource for selling DVDs and videotapes.\nIMDb continued to expand its functionality. On January 15, 2002, it added a subscription service known as IMDbPro, aimed at entertainment professionals. IMDbPro was announced and launched at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival by Barnaby Dorfman. It provides a variety of services including film production and box office details, a company directory, and the ability of subscribers to add personal information pages.\nFrom 1996 onwards, an annual newsletter email (archived on the website) has been sent from Col Needham to contributors on the first day of each calendar year. The annual newsletter lists various information about the past year on the site, including stats, top contributors tally for the year (the top 300 users, currently; fewer in previous years), and a perspective on the site's progress and future.\nAs an additional incentive for users, as of 2003, users identified as one of the \"top 100 contributors\" of hard data received complimentary free access to IMDbPro for the following calendar year; for 2006 this was increased to the top 150 contributors, and for 2010 to the top 250.\nIn 2008, IMDb launched their first official foreign-language version with IMDb.de, in German. Also in 2008, IMDb acquired two other companies: Withoutabox and Box Office Mojo.\nThe website was originally Perl-based, but IMDb no longer discloses what software it uses for reasons of security, apart from mentioning The Apache Software Foundation. In 2010, the site was filtered in China.\nIn 2016, The IMDb Studio at Sundance was launched, a talk show that is presented on IMDb and YouTube.\nIn April 2017, IMDb celebrated its 25th anniversary. As of that year, Needham was still managing IMDb from its main office in Bristol in the Castlemead office tower.\nIn January 2019, IMDb launched an ad-supported streaming service called Freedive. This was the company's second attempt at a streaming service; it launched a similar service in 2008. In June 2019, Freedive was rebranded as IMDb TV. In April 2022, the service was rebranded again as Amazon Freevee.\n\nContent and format\nData provided by subjects\nIn 2006, IMDb introduced its \"R\u00e9sum\u00e9 Subscription Service\", where an actor or crew member can post their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and upload photos for a yearly fee. IMDb r\u00e9sum\u00e9 pages are kept on a sub-page of the regular entry about that person, with a regular entry automatically created for each r\u00e9sum\u00e9 subscriber who does not already have one.\nAs of 2012, Resume Services was included as part of an IMDbPro subscription and is no longer offered as a separate subscription service.\n\nCopyright, vandalism and error issues\nVolunteers who contribute content to the database technically retain copyright on their contributions, but the compilation of the content becomes the exclusive property of IMDb with the full right to copy, modify, and sublicense it, and they are verified before posting. However, credit is not given on specific title or filmography pages to the contributor(s) who have provided information. Conversely, a credited text entry, such as a plot summary, may be corrected for content, grammar, sentence structure, perceived omission or error, by other contributors without having to add their names as co-authors. Due to the time required for processing submitted data or text before it is displayed, IMDb is different from user-contributed projects like Discogs, or OpenStreetMap, or Wikipedia, in that contributors cannot add, delete, or modify the data or text on impulse, and the manipulation of data is controlled by IMDb technology and salaried staff.\nIMDb has been subject to deliberate additions of false information; in 2012 a spokesperson said: \"We make it easy for users and professionals to update much of our content, which is why we have an 'edit page'. The data that is submitted goes through a series of consistency checks before it goes live. Given the sheer volume of the information, occasional mistakes are inevitable, and, when reported, they are promptly fixed. We always welcome corrections.\"\nThe Java Movie Database (JMDB) is reportedly creating an IMDb_Error.log file that lists all the errors found while processing the IMDb plain text files. A Wiki alternative to IMDb is Open Media Database whose content is also contributed by users but licensed under a Creative Commons license (CC BY) and the GFDL. Since 2007, IMDb has been experimenting with wiki-programmed sections for complete film synopses, parental guides, and FAQs about titles as determined by (and answered by) individual contributors.\n\nData format and access\nIMDb, unlike other AI-automated queries, does not provide an API for automated queries. However, most of the data can be downloaded as compressed plain text files and the information can be extracted using the command-line interface tools provided. There is also a Java-based graphical user interface (GUI) application available that is able to process the compressed plain text files, which allows a search and a display of the information. This GUI application supports different languages, but the movie related data are in English, as made available by IMDb. A Python package called IMDbPY (since renamed cinemagoer) can also be used to process the compressed plain text files into a number of different SQL databases, enabling easier access to the entire dataset for searching or data mining.\n\nFilm titles\nThe IMDb has sites in English as well as versions translated completely or in part into other languages (Danish, Finnish, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish and Romanian). The non-English language sites display film titles in the specified language. Originally, IMDb's English language sites displayed titles according to their original country-of-origin language, however, in 2010 IMDb began allowing individual users in the UK and US to choose primary title display by either the original-language titles, or the US or UK release title (normally, in English).\n\nPodcasts\nOn October 21, 2021, the site added the ability to add podcasts (both as series and episodes) as titles to the site, via an IMDb employee announcement on their Sprinklr forums. As of December 2022, the numbers of podcast series stood at 24,778, with podcast episodes at 3,076,386.\n\nIMDb STARmeter Awards\nAnnually, IMDb STARmeter Awards are presented to industry professionals in various categories. Professionals who have appeared in its annual \"top 10 lists\" are considered for this award. \"IMDb determines its definitive top 10 lists using data from IMDbPro STARmeter rankings, which are based on the actual page views of the more than 200 million monthly visitors to the site.\" Initially IMDb STARmeter Awards were given in two categories, IMDb Fan favorite STARmeter Award and IMDb Breakout STARmeter Award. Celebrating 20th anniversary of IMDbPro, it launched IMDb Icon STARmeter Award, which is given to prominent artists of the industry who have appeared in the top 10 positions throughout the year. Salma Hayek received the inaugural award.\n\nLegal and policy issues\nIn 2011, in the case of Hoang v. Amazon.com, Inc., IMDb was sued by an anonymous actress for at least US$1,075,000 because the movie website publicly disclosed her age (40, at the time) without her consent. The actress claimed that revealing her age could cause her to lose acting opportunities. Judge Marsha J. Pechman, a US district judge in Seattle, dismissed the lawsuit, saying the actress had no grounds to proceed with an anonymous complaint. The actress re-filed and so revealed that she was Huong Hoang of Texas, who uses the stage name Junie Hoang. In 2013, Pechman dismissed all causes of action except for a breach of contract claim against IMDb; a jury then sided with IMDb on that claim. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court judgment in March 2015.\nAlso in 2011, in the case of United Video Properties Inc., et al. v. Amazon.Com Inc. et al., IMDb and Amazon were sued by Rovi Corporation and others for patent infringement over their various program listing offerings. The patent claims were ultimately construed in a way favorable to IMDb, and Rovi \/ United Video Properties lost the case. In April 2014, the decision was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals.\nIn January 2017, the State of California enacted state bill AB-1687, a SAG-AFTRA-backed anti-ageism statute which requires \"commercial online entertainment employment services\" to honor requests by their subscribers for their ages and birthdays to be hidden. By the beginning of 2017, IMDb had received more than 2,300 requests from individuals to remove their date of birth from the site. Included in this group were 10 Academy Award winners and another 71 nominated for Oscars, Emmys, or Golden Globes. On February 23, 2017, Judge Vince Girdhari Chhabria issued a stay on the bill pending a further trial, on the ground that it possibly violated the First Amendment because it inhibited the public consumption of information. He also questioned the intent of the bill, as it was ostensibly meant to target IMDb. In February 2018, Chhabria struck down the statute, and in June 2020, the Ninth Circuit affirmed Chhabria's judgement, holding that the statute was an unconstitutional content-based restriction that violated the First Amendment.\nIMDb had long maintained that it would keep all valid information, but changed that policy related to birth names in 2019, instead removing birth names that are not widely and publicly known, of persons who no longer use their birth names. This was done in response to pressure from LGBTQ groups against the publication of the birth names of transgender people without their consent (deadnaming). Any name a person had previously been credited under, however, continues to be maintained in the credits section.\n\nStatistics\nAs of 16 August 2024, IMDb tracked 13 categories:\n\nSee also\nList of online databases\nGoodreads\nLetterboxd\nRotten Tomatoes\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nLurrie, Stephen (February 21, 2023). \"Meet the Superusers Behind IMDb, the Internet's Favorite Movie Site\".

It was the first of six Ozu films to win the Kinema Junpo Award for Best Film of the Year. In 1959, Ozu loosely remade the film as Good Morning.\nThe film's story centers on two young brothers whose faith in their father, an office worker, is shaken by what they perceive as his kowtowing to the boss.\n\nPlot\nThe Yoshi family has just moved to the Tokyo suburbs, close to where the father Kennosuke's direct boss, Iwasaki, is staying. Kennosuke's two young sons Keiji and Ryoichi are supposed to be going to school, but owing to the threats of a group of neighborhood and school bullies, they decide to play truant. After the teacher speaks to their father, Keiji and Ryoichi have no choice but to go to school. They attempt to eat sparrow's eggs to get stronger so that they can get back at the boys, but an older delivery boy Kozou decides to help them out to threaten the bullies, and they emerge as the top dogs amongst the gang.\nOne of the neighborhood kids is Taro, whose father is Iwasaki himself. The boys argue amongst themselves who has the most powerful father. Not long after, they visit Taro's home, where the office workers have gathered under Iwasaki, who screens some home movies for the amusement of the gathering. The two brothers witness on film how their father, who to them is stern and whom they look up to, plays the buffoon before his colleagues and boss.\nHumiliated, they go home and decide that their father isn't such an important person after all.  They throw a massive tantrum, and confront their father asking him why he has to grovel under Taro's father. Kennosuke answers that Taro's father is richer and holds a higher position than he does. Dissatisfied with this answer, the two decide to hold a hunger strike.  Ryoichi gets a spanking from his father, but after the children have gone to bed, the father confides in the wife that he does not enjoy doing what he does.  Both wish for a better future for their children.\nThe next day, the children attempt a hunger strike during breakfast, but succumb to a dish of onigiri. Kennosuke manages a reconciliation with them. The children say they would like to be a lieutenant general and a general respectively. On their way to school, they see Taro's father in a car, and they urge their father to go up and greet him. As Kennosuke takes a convenient car ride to work, the brothers walk to school with Taro and the rest of the gang.\n\nCast\nTatsuo Sait\u014d as Chichi\nTomio Aoki as Keiji (Younger Son)\nMitsuko Yoshikawa as Haha (Yoshi's Wife)\nHideo Sugawara as Ryoichi (Older Son)\nTakeshi Sakamoto as Juuyaku (Iwasaki, Executive)\nTeruyo Hayami as Fujin (Iwasaki's Wife)\nSeiichi Kato as Kodomo (Taro)\nShoichi Kofujita as Kozou (Delivery Boy)\nSeiji Nishimura as Sensei (Teacher)\nZentaro Iijima, Shotaro Fujimatsu, Michio Sato, Kuniyasu Hayashi, Akio Nomura and Teruaki Ishiwatari as Asobi nakama (Friend)\n\nReception\nI Was Born, But... has a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 23 reviews, with a weighted average of 7.97\/10.

Scott wrote: \"Everything in this film is utterly believable, so much so that at times it seems almost anecdotal, a sweet little anthology of kids doing the darnedest things. That it is more \u2014 a small masterpiece, perfect in design and execution \u2014 almost goes without saying, but the film\u2019s profundity and its charm go hand in hand.\" In 2009, the film was ranked at No. 59 on the list of the Greatest Japanese Films of All Time by Japanese film magazine kinema Junpo. It ranked 183rd in the 2012 Sight & Sound critics' poll of the greatest films ever made.\nFilm critic Stephen Amos stated: \"There is an underlining darkness in the film, one that reflects the difficulty of the time and the inevitability of disappointment \u2013 a theme which laces much of Ozu\u2019s work.\"\n\nHome media\nIn 2011, the BFI released a Region 2 DVD of the film as a bonus feature on its Dual Format Edition (Blu-ray + DVD) of Good Morning.\nThe film is also available as part of The Criterion Collection's Eclipse series DVD box set \"Silent Ozu: Three Family Comedies\".\nIn 2017, The Criterion Collection's DVD and Blu-ray reissues of Good Morning included a remastered edition of the film, complete with new musical score.\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\nI Was Born, But... at IMDb\nI Was Born, But... at AllMovie\nI Was Born, But... at Rotten Tomatoes","90":"It Feels So Good (\u706b\u53e3\u306e\u3075\u305f\u308a, Kak\u00f4 no Futari) is a 2020 erotic drama written and directed by Haruhiko Arai, based on the novel by Kazufumi Shiraishi.

James Marsh of the South China Morning Post was less kind, calling the film \"an interminable bore\" and stating \"Nothing remotely arousing is created during the numerous sex scenes, which are interspersed with dollops of pseudointellectual gibberish.\"\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n\n== References ==","91":"In This Corner of the World (\u3053\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u306e\u7247\u9685\u306b, Kono Sekai no Katasumi ni) is a 2016 Japanese animated wartime drama film produced by MAPPA, co-written and directed by Sunao Katabuchi, featuring character designs by Hidenori Matsubara and music by Kotringo. The film is based on the manga of the same name written and illustrated by Fumiyo K\u014dno. It premiered in Japan on November 12, 2016. Animatsu Entertainment licensed the global distribution rights of the film in June 2016. Shout! Factory acquired the distribution rights for North America, with a U.S. theatrical release on August 11, 2017, co-released by Funimation Films. An extended version of the film, titled In This Corner (and Other Corners) of the World (\u3053\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u306e\uff08\u3055\u3089\u306b\u3044\u304f\u3064\u3082\u306e\uff09\u7247\u9685\u306b, Kono Sekai no (Sara ni Ikutsumono) Katasumi ni), premiered on December 20, 2019 and surpassed the extended 70mm cut of Final Yamato by five minutes to become one of the two longest theatrical animated films to date, tied with Chang'an.\nThe film is set in the 1930s\u20131940s in Hiroshima and Kure in Japan, roughly 10 years before and after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, but mainly in 1944\u201345. In the film, nature and traditional culture in Japan are clearly described and contrasted with the cruel and irredeemable scenes brought by the war. Though it is a fictional account, the official guidebook of the film claims that the episodes and background of the story are based on facts and real incidents of the lost townscape of pre-war Hiroshima damaged by the bombing, as researched by the production staff.\n\nPlot\nA young girl named Suzu lives in a seaside town called Eba near Hiroshima. One day, Suzu paints a picture for her classmate, Tetsu, as he stares at the sea and laments the death of his brother, who drowned during his service as a sailor. In 1943, 18-year-old Suzu marries a young military clerk named Shusaku, whom she had once met as a child, and joins his family in Kure, a large naval port city 15 miles away from Hiroshima. As she adjusts to her new life, the threat of the Pacific War begins to encroach on the townspeople.\nSuzu and Shusaku's family house is located on a hillside overlooking the town and with a view of the Combined Fleet in the harbor. Suzu's sister-in-law Keiko and niece Harumi occasionally stay at the house. As food shortages become commonplace, the government implements food rationing. Warning and evacuation preparations against United States air raids begin. Suzu, as a housewife in a Tonarigumi, takes turns overseeing food distribution, attends training against air raids, and other wartime preparations.\nIn December 1944, Tetsu, now a sailor in the Imperial Navy, visits Suzu. Understanding that it might be Suzu's last chance to see Tetsu alive, Shusaku leaves them alone to talk. Though he confessed his love for her, Suzu told him she loved her husband more than anything. The next spring, Shusaku is drafted by the Navy and quartered with troops in Otake City, 40 miles away.\nIn 1945, the Americans begin air raids on the Japanese mainland; in Kure, US Navy aircraft bomb the port. In addition to the death of her brother Y\u014dichi, Suzu loses her right hand and Harumi is killed when a time-delayed bomb detonates close to them. After becoming depressed, Suzu decides to return to the safety of her hometown but her departure is delayed due to a doctor's appointment. That morning, Suzu and Keiko notice a bizarre light, followed by a sudden quake. The radio doesn't work and then the family sees a towering cloud in the direction of Hiroshima City. They soon learn that a new, devastating bomb has fallen on Hiroshima, killing countless citizens. For a while, Suzu is unable to get information about her hometown.\nA few days later, in a radio address, the Emperor of Japan announces the end of the War. Suzu, having grown accustomed to the single-minded focus of keeping the family alive, is forced to accept the reality of her losses and falls into despair. American forces then arrive and occupy Kure, providing food to the local population. Suzu visits her grandmother Ito's family house in Kusatsu, a rural town to the west of Hiroshima and out of the affected area, to see her sister Sumi, the only survivor of Suzu's family. Sumi informs her of the fate of their parents: their mother had left for supplies and is presumed to have been killed instantly by the bomb's initial blast and shock wave while their father died a few months later after falling ill and succumbing to possible radiation poisoning. Sumi herself has fallen seriously ill from the radiation. Shusaku returns and reunites with Suzu. They come across an orphaned girl and adopt her. Suzu regains her passion for life slowly, with the courage and affection of her friends and family. As the credits roll, their adopted daughter is shown growing up in the Hojo residence, sewing clothes, aided by Suzu in post-war Japan.\n\nCast\nDevelopment\nThe project was announced in August 2012 and began crowdfunding in March 2015 to raise funds. The crowdfunding was a success, with a Japanese record of 3,374 contributors and the \u00a539 million raised exceeding the \u00a520 million goal.\nAnother crowdfunding, to send Katabuchi overseas for promotion, was started on November 22, 2016 and reached the goal of \u00a510 million within eleven hours.\nDirector Sunao Katabuchi tried to add accurate details to the backgrounds of the film, such as one shot which took over 20 revisions to get right, using aerial photographs to estimate the size of a shop and interviewing over 10 elderly residents.\nOn July 25, 2018, the official Twitter account for the film announced that the film would receive an extended version titled In This Corner (and Other Corners) of the World (\u3053\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u306e\uff08\u3055\u3089\u306b\u3044\u304f\u3064\u3082\u306e\uff09\u7247\u9685\u306b, Kono Sekai no (Sara ni Ikutsumono) Katsumi ni).

In 2009 the film was voted at No. 59 on the list of The Greatest Japanese Films of All Time by Japanese film magazine Kinema Junpo.\n\nPlot\nDuring the Sengoku period, in 1571, Takeda Shingen, daimy\u014d of the Takeda clan, meets a thief his brother Nobukado spared from crucifixion due to the thief's uncanny resemblance to Shingen; the brothers agree that he would prove useful as a double, and they decide to use the thief as a kagemusha, a political decoy. Later, while the Takeda army lays siege to a castle belonging to Tokugawa Ieyasu, Shingen is shot while listening to a flute playing in the enemy camp. He then orders his forces to withdraw and commands his generals to keep his death a secret for three years before succumbing to his wound. Meanwhile, Shingen's rivals Oda Nobunaga, Tokugawa Ieyasu, and Uesugi Kenshin each contemplate the consequences of Shingen's withdrawal, unaware of his death.\nNobukado presents the thief to Shingen's generals, proposing to have him impersonate Shingen full-time. Although the thief is unaware of Shingen's death initially, he eventually finds Shingen's preserved corpse in a large jar, having believed it to contain treasure. The generals then decide they cannot trust the thief and release him. Later, the jar is dropped into Lake Suwa, which spies working for the Tokugawa and Oda forces witness. Suspecting that Shingen has died, the spies go to report their observation, but the thief, having overheard the spies, returns to the Takeda forces and offers to work as a kagemusha. The Takeda clan preserves the deception by announcing that they were simply making an offering of sake to the god of the lake, and the spies are ultimately convinced by the thief's performance.\nReturning home, the kagemusha successfully fools Shingen's retinue by imitating the late warlord's gestures and learning more about him. When the kagemusha must preside over a clan meeting, he is instructed by Nobukado to remain silent until Nobukado brings the generals to a consensus, whereupon the kagemusha will simply agree with the generals' plan and dismiss the council. However, Shingen's son Katsuyori is incensed by his father's decree of the three year subterfuge, which delays his inheritance and leadership of the clan. Katsuyori thus decides to test the kagemusha in front of the council, as the majority of the attendants are still unaware of Shingen's death. He directly asks the kagemusha what course of action should be taken, but the kagemusha is able to answer convincingly in Shingen's own manner, which further impresses the generals.\nSoon, in 1573, Nobunaga mobilizes his forces to attack Azai Nagamasa, continuing his campaign in central Honshu to maintain his control of Kyoto against the growing opposition. When the Tokugawa and Oda forces launch an attack against the Takeda, Katsuyori begins a counter-offensive against the advice of his generals. The kagemusha is then forced to lead reinforcements in the Battle of Takatenjin, and helps inspire the troops to victory. In a fit of overconfidence however, the kagemusha attempts to ride Shingen's notoriously temperamental horse, and falls off. When those who rush to help him see that he does not have Shingen's battle scars, he is revealed as an impostor, and is driven out in disgrace, allowing Katsuyori to take over the clan. Sensing weakness in the Takeda clan leadership, the Oda and Tokugawa forces are emboldened to begin a full-scale offensive into the Takeda homeland.\nBy 1575, now in full control of the Takeda army, Katsuyori leads a counter-offensive against Nobunaga in Nagashino. Although courageous in their assault, several waves of Takeda cavalry and infantry are cut down by volleys of gunfire from Oda arquebusiers deployed behind wooden stockades, effectively eliminating the Takeda army. The kagemusha, who has followed the Takeda army, desperately takes up a spear and charges toward the Oda lines before being shot himself. Mortally wounded, the kagemusha attempts to retrieve the f\u016brinkazan banner, which had fallen into a river, but succumbs to his wounds in the water where his body is carried away by the current.\n\nProduction\nGeorge Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola are credited at the end of the film as executive producers in the international version. This is because they persuaded 20th Century-Fox to make up a shortfall in the film's budget when the original producers, Toho Studios, could not afford to complete the film. In return, 20th Century-Fox received the international distribution rights to the film. Coppola and Kurosawa appeared together in Suntory whisky commercials to raise money for the production.\nKurosawa originally cast the actor Shintaro Katsu in the title role. Katsu left the production, however, before the first day of shooting was over; in an interview for the Criterion Collection DVD, executive producer Coppola states that Katsu angered Kurosawa by arriving with his own camera crew to record Kurosawa's filmmaking methods. It is unclear whether Katsu was fired or left of his own accord, but he was replaced by Tatsuya Nakadai, a well-known actor who had appeared in a number of Kurosawa's previous films. Nakadai played both the kagemusha and the lord whom he impersonated.\nKurosawa wrote a part in Kagemusha for his longtime regular actor Takashi Shimura, and Kagemusha was the last Kurosawa film in which Shimura appeared. However, the scene in which he plays a servant who accompanies a western doctor to a meeting with Shingen was cut from the foreign release of the film. The Criterion Collection DVD release of the film restored this scene as well as approximately another eighteen minutes in the film.\nAccording to Lucas, Kurosawa used 5,000 extras for the final battle sequence, filming for a whole day, then he cut it down to 90 seconds in the final release. Many special effects, and a number of scenes that filled holes in the story, landed on the \"cutting-room floor\".\n\nCast\nTatsuya Nakadai as Takeda Shingen (\u6b66\u7530 \u4fe1\u7384) and the Kagemusha (\u5f71\u6b66\u8005)\nTsutomu Yamazaki as Takeda Nobukado (\u6b66\u7530 \u4fe1\u5ec9), Shingen's younger brother.\nKenichi Hagiwara as Takeda Katsuyori (\u6b66\u7530 \u52dd\u983c), Shingen's son and heir.\nJinpachi Nezu as Tsuchiya Sohachiro (\u571f\u5c4b \u5b97\u516b\u90ce), chief bodyguard for Takeda Shingen and the Kagemusha.\nHideji \u014ctaki as Yamagata Masakage (\u5c71\u7e23 \u660c\u666f), Shingen's most experienced general.\nDaisuke Ryu as Oda Nobunaga (\u7e54\u7530 \u4fe1\u9577), one of Shingen's chief rivals for control of Japan.\nMasayuki Yui as Tokugawa Ieyasu (\u5fb3\u5ddd \u5bb6\u5eb7), Nobunaga's strongest ally.\nKaori Momoi as Otsuyanokata (\u304a\u6d25\u5f25\u306e\u65b9), one of Shingen's concubines.\nMitsuko Baisho as Oyunokata (\u65bc\u3086\u3046\u306e\u65b9), another one of Shingen's concubines.\nHideo Murota as Baba Nobuharu (\u99ac\u5834 \u4fe1\u6625), one of the chief generals in the Takeda Clan's army.\nTakayuki Shiho as Nait\u014d Masatoyo (\u5185\u85e4 \u660c\u8c4a), another important general in the Takeda Clan's army.\nK\u014dji Shimizu as Atobe Katsusuke (\u8de1\u90e8 \u52dd\u8cc7)\nNoburo Shimizu as Hara Masatane (\u539f \u660c\u80e4)\nSen Yamamoto as Oyamada Nobushige (\u5c0f\u5c71\u7530 \u4fe1\u8302)\nShuhei Sugimori as K\u014dsaka Masanobu (\u9ad8\u5742 \u660c\u4fe1)\nTakashi Shimura as Taguchi Gyobu (\u7530\u53e3\u5211\u90e8)\nEiichi Kanakubo as Uesugi Kenshin (\u4e0a\u6749 \u8b19\u4fe1), Shingen's other chief rival for control of Japan.\nFrancis Selleck as Priest\nJir\u014d Yabuki as Equestrian\nKamatari Fujiwara as Doctor\n\nRelease\nKagemusha was released theatrically in Japan on April 26, 1980, where it was distributed by Toho.

Between 1989 and 1993, Sheridan directed three critically acclaimed films set in Ireland, My Left Foot (1989), The Field (1990), and In the Name of the Father (1993), and later directed the films The Boxer (1997), In America (2003), and Brothers (2009). Sheridan received six Academy Award nominations.\n\nLife and career\nJim Sheridan was born in Dublin on 6 February 1949. He is the brother of playwright Peter Sheridan. The family ran a lodging house, while Anna Sheridan worked at a hotel and Peter Sheridan Snr was a railway clerk with CI\u00c9. Sheridan's early education was at a Christian Brothers school. In 1969 he attended University College Dublin to study English and History. In 1972, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English. He became involved in student theatre there, where he met Neil Jordan, who also was later to become an important Irish film director.  After graduating from UCD in 1972, Sheridan and his brother began writing and staging plays, and in the late 1970s began working with the Project Theatre Company.\nIn 1981, Sheridan emigrated to Canada, but eventually settled in the Hell's Kitchen section of New York City in the United States.  He enrolled in NYU's Tisch School of the Arts and became the artistic director of the Irish Arts Center.\nSheridan returned to Ireland in the late 1980s.  In 1989, he directed My Left Foot (with Daniel Day-Lewis), which became a critical and commercial success and won Day-Lewis and Brenda Fricker Academy Awards. He followed that with The Field (with Richard Harris) in 1990; then with In the Name of the Father in 1993, a fictionalised re-telling of the case of the Guildford Four. The film won the Golden Bear at the 44th Berlin International Film Festival.\nIn 1996 he co-wrote Some Mother's Son with Terry George. The Boxer was nominated for a Golden Globe for best film drama in 1997. The film was Sheridan's third collaboration with Day-Lewis after My Left Foot and In the Name of the Father, making him the only director to work with Day-Lewis on three films. In 2003, he released the semi-autobiographical In America, which tells the story of a family of Irish immigrants trying to succeed in New York. The film received positive reviews and earned Samantha Morton and Djimon Hounsou Academy Award nominations. In 2005 he released Get Rich or Die Tryin', a film starring rap star 50 Cent.\nSheridan helmed the 2009 film Brothers, starring Tobey Maguire. Jake Gyllenhaal, and Natalie Portman, which was shot in New Mexico. He also directed the thriller Dream House, which starred Daniel Craig, Naomi Watts, and Rachel Weisz.\n\nHe is the son of Anne and Peter Sheridan. He has four daughters. His youngest daughter, Clodagh Amira Sheridan, is his child with his partner, the film director Zahara Moufid. His three older daughters, Kirsten, Naomi, and Tess, were born to his late wife  Fran Sheridan. Additionally, he has six siblings: Ita Rafferty, Peter Sheridan, John Sheridan, Frankie Sheridan, Gerard Sheridan, and Paul Sheridan.\nIn 2015, Sheridan was awarded UCD Alumnus of the Year in Arts & Humanities.\n\nFilmography\nFilms\nExecutive producer\n\nBorstal Boy (2000)\nOn the Edge (2001)\nBloody Sunday (2002)\nWhere's Daddy!

Kabuki theatre is known for its heavily stylised performances, its glamorous, highly decorated costumes, and for the elaborate kumadori make-up worn by some of its performers. The term kabuki originates from a verb that was used to describe young samurai patrons, meaning \"being weird\" or \"offbeat.\"\nKabuki is thought to have originated in the early Edo period, when the art's founder, Izumo no Okuni, formed a female dance troupe that performed dances and light sketches in Kyoto. The art form later developed into its present all-male theatrical form after women were banned from performing in kabuki theatre in 1629. Kabuki developed throughout the late 17th century and reached its zenith in the mid-18th century.\nIn 2005, kabuki theatre was proclaimed by UNESCO as an intangible heritage possessing outstanding universal value. In 2008, it was inscribed in the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.\n\nEtymology\nThe individual kanji that make up the word kabuki can be read as 'sing' (\u6b4c), 'dance' (\u821e), and 'skill' (\u4f0e). Kabuki is therefore sometimes translated as 'the art of singing and dancing'. These are, however, ateji characters which do not reflect actual etymology. The kanji of 'skill' generally refers to a performer in kabuki theatre.\nSince the word kabuki is believed to derive from the verb kabuku, meaning 'to lean' or 'to be out of the ordinary', the word kabuki can also be interpreted as 'avant-garde' or 'bizarre' theatre. The expression kabukimono (\u6b4c\u821e\u4f0e\u8005) referred originally to those who were bizarrely dressed. It is often translated into English as 'strange things' or 'the crazy ones', and referred to the style of dress worn by gangs of samurai.\n\nHistory\n1603\u20131629: Female kabuki\nThe history of kabuki began in 1603 during the Edo period when former shrine maiden Izumo no Okuni, possibly a miko of Izumo-taisha, began performing with a troupe of young female dancers a new, simple style of dance drama in pantomime, on a makeshift stage in the dry bed of the Kamo River in Kyoto\nIn the earliest forms of kabuki, female performers played both men and women in comic playlets about ordinary life. It did not take long for the style to become popular, and Okuni was asked to perform before the Imperial Court. In the wake of such success, rival troupes quickly formed, and kabuki was born as ensemble dance and drama performed by women.\nMuch of the appeal of kabuki in this era was due to the ribald, suggestive themes featured by many troupes; this appeal was further augmented by the fact that many performers were also involved in prostitution. For this reason, kabuki was also known as 'prostitute kabuki' (\u904a\u5973\u6b4c\u821e\u5993) during this period.\nKabuki became a common form of entertainment in the red-light districts of Japan, especially in Yoshiwara, the registered red-light district in Edo. The widespread appeal of kabuki often meant that a diverse crowd of different social classes gathered to watch performances, a unique occurrence that happened nowhere else in the city of Edo. Kabuki theatres became well known as a place to both see and be seen in terms of fashion and style, as the audience\u2014commonly comprising a number of socially low but economically wealthy merchants\u2014typically used a performance as a way to feature the fashion trends.\nAs an art-form, kabuki also provided inventive new forms of entertainment, featuring new musical styles played on the shamisen, clothes and fashion often dramatic in appearance, famous actors and stories often intended to mirror current events. Performances typically lasted from morning until sunset, with surrounding teahouses providing meals, refreshments and place to socialise. The area surrounding kabuki theatres also featured a number of shops selling kabuki souvenirs.\nAfter performances, women performers would offer sexual services for those who could afford it.  Since fights would usually erupt among the young samurai patrons, shogunal authorities, who wanted to maintain order, banned women from performing on stage. Following this ban, Okuni replaced the women with boys in Kabuki performances. During the early seventeenth century, within a culture where pederasty was pervasive among samurai, her decision didn't significantly harm the theater's popularity. In fact, it may have even benefited Kabuki, as it caught the attention of the third shogun, Iemitsu, known for his interest in pederasty. He even arranged special performances. However, after Iemitsu's death in 1651 and with samurai now fighting for the attention of boys rather than girls, the shogunate imposed further restrictions, allowing only males over 15 to perform on stage.\nKabuki switched to adult male actors, called yaro-kabuki, in the mid-1600s. Adult male actors, however, continued to play both female and male characters, and kabuki retained its popularity, remaining a key element of the Edo period urban life-style.\nAlthough kabuki was performed widely across Japan, the Nakamura-za, Ichimura-za and Kawarazaki-za theatres became the most widely known and popular kabuki theatres, where some of the most successful kabuki performances were and still are held.\n\n1629\u20131673: Transition to yar\u014d-kabuki\nDuring the time period of 1628\u20131673, the modern version of all-male kabuki actors, a style of kabuki known as yar\u014d-kabuki (lit., \"young man kabuki\"), was established, following the ban on women and young boys. Cross-dressing male actors, known as \"onnagata\" (lit., \"woman role\") or \"oyama\" took over previously female- or wakashu-acted roles. Young (adolescent) men were still preferred for women's roles due to their less obviously masculine appearance and the higher pitch of their voices. The roles of adolescent men in kabuki, known as wakashu, were also played by young men, often selected for their attractiveness; this became a common practice, and wakashu were often presented in an erotic context.\nThe focus of kabuki performances also increasingly began to emphasise drama alongside dance. However, the ribald nature of kabuki performances continued, with male actors also engaging in sex work for both female and male customers. Audiences frequently became rowdy, and brawls occasionally broke out, sometimes over the favors of a particularly popular or handsome actor, leading the shogunate to ban first onnagata and then wakash\u016b roles for a short period of time; both bans were rescinded by 1652.\n\n1673\u20131841: Genroku period kabuki\nDuring the Genroku period, kabuki thrived, with the structure of kabuki plays formalising into the structure they are performed in today, alongside many other elements which eventually came to be recognised as a key aspect of kabuki tradition, such as conventional character tropes. Kabuki theater and ningy\u014d j\u014druri, an elaborate form of puppet theater later known as bunraku, became closely associated with each other, mutually influencing the other's further development.\nThe famous playwright Chikamatsu Monzaemon, one of the first professional kabuki playwrights, produced several influential works during this time, though the piece usually acknowledged as his most significant, Sonezaki Shinj\u016b (The Love Suicides at Sonezaki), was originally written for bunraku. Like many bunraku plays, it was adapted for kabuki, eventually becoming popular enough to reportedly inspire a number of real-life \"copycat\" suicides, and leading to a government ban on shinju mono (plays about love suicides) in 1723.\nAlso during the Genroku period was the development of the mie style of posing, credited to kabuki actor Ichikawa Danj\u016br\u014d I, alongside the development of the mask-like kumadori makeup worn by kabuki actors in some plays.\nIn the mid-18th century, kabuki fell out of favor for a time, with bunraku taking its place as the premier form of stage entertainment among the lower social classes. This occurred partly because of the emergence of several skilled bunraku playwrights in that time. Little of note would occur in the further development of kabuki until the end of the century, when it began to reemerge in popularity.\n\n1842\u20131868: Saruwaka-ch\u014d kabuki\nIn the 1840s, repeated periods of drought led to a series of fires affecting Edo, with kabuki theatres\u2014traditionally made of wood\u2014frequently burning down, forcing many to relocate. When the area that housed the Nakamura-za was completely destroyed in 1841, the sh\u014dgun refused to allow the theatre to be rebuilt, saying that it was against fire code.\nThe shogunate, mostly disapproving of the socialisation and trade that occurred in kabuki theatres between merchants, actors and prostitutes, took advantage of the fire crisis in the following year, forcing the Nakamura-za, Ichimura-za and Kawarazaki-za out of the city limits and into Asakusa, a northern suburb of Edo. This was part of the larger Tenp\u014d Reforms that the shogunate instituted starting in 1842 to restrict the overindulgence of pleasures. Actors, stagehands, and others associated with the performances were also forced to move as a result of the death of their livelihood; despite the move of everyone involved in kabuki performance, and many in the surrounding areas, to the new location of the theatres, the inconvenience of the distance led to a reduction in attendance. These factors, along with strict regulations, pushed much of kabuki \"underground\" in Edo, with performances changing locations to avoid the authorities.\nThe theatres' new location was called Saruwaka-ch\u014d, or Saruwaka-machi; the last thirty years of the Tokugawa shogunate's rule is often referred to as the \"Saruwaka-machi period\", and is well known for having produced some of the most exaggerated kabuki in Japanese history.\nSaruwaka-machi became the new theatre district for the Nakamura-za, Ichimura-za and Kawarazaki-za theatres. The district was located on the main street of Asakusa, which ran through the middle of the small city. The street was renamed after Saruwaka Kanzaburo, who initiated Edo kabuki in the Nakamura-za in 1624.\nEuropean artists began noticing Japanese theatrical performances and artwork, and many artists, such as Claude Monet, were inspired by Japanese woodblock prints. This Western interest prompted Japanese artists to increase their depictions of daily life, including the depiction of theatres, brothels, main streets and so on. One artist, Utagawa Hiroshige, produced a series of prints based on Saruwaka from the Saruwaka-machi period in Asakusa.\nDespite the revival of kabuki in another location, the relocation diminished the tradition's most abundant inspirations for costuming, make-up, and storylines. Ichikawa Kodanji IV was considered one of the most active and successful actors during the Saruwaka-machi period. Deemed unattractive, he mainly performed buy\u014d, or dancing, in dramas written by Kawatake Mokuami, who also wrote during the Meiji era to follow. Kawatake Mokuami commonly wrote plays that depicted the common lives of the people of Edo. He introduced shichigo-cho (seven-and-five syllable meter) dialogue and music such as kiyomoto. His kabuki performances became quite popular once the Saruwaka-machi period ended and theatre returned to Edo; many of his works are still performed.\nIn 1868, the Tokugawa ceased to exist, with the restoration of the Emperor. Emperor Meiji was restored to power and moved from Kyoto to the new capital of Edo, or Tokyo, beginning the Meiji period. Kabuki once again returned to the pleasure quarters of Edo, and throughout the Meiji period became increasingly more radical, as modern styles of kabuki plays and performances emerged. Playwrights experimented with the introduction of new genres to kabuki, and introduced twists on traditional stories.\n\nPost-Meiji period kabuki\nBeginning in 1868, enormous cultural changes, such as the fall of the Tokugawa shogunate, the elimination of the samurai class, and the opening of Japan to the West, helped to spark kabuki's re-emergence. Both actors and playwrights strove to improve the reputation of kabuki in the face of new foreign influence and amongst the upper classes, partially through adapting traditional styles to modern tastes. This endeavour would prove successful, with the Emperor sponsoring a kabuki performance on 21 April 1887.\nAfter World War II, the occupying forces briefly banned kabuki, which had formed a strong base of support for Japan's war efforts since 1931. This ban was in conjunction with broader restrictions on media and art forms that the American military occupation instituted after WWII. However, by 1947 the ban on kabuki was rescinded, but censorship rules lingered.\n\nPost-war to modern day kabuki\nThe ensuing period of occupation following World War II posited a difficult time for kabuki; besides the war's physical impact and devastation upon the country, some schools of thought chose to reject both the styles and artforms of pre-war Japan, kabuki amongst them. Director Tetsuji Takechi's popular and innovative productions of kabuki classics at this time are credited with sparking new interest in kabuki in the Kansai region. Of the many popular young stars who performed with the Takechi Kabuki, Nakamura Ganjiro III (b. 1931) was the leading figure, first known as Nakamura Senjaku before taking his current name. It was this period of kabuki in Osaka that became known as the \"Age of Senjaku\" in his honor.\nToday, kabuki is the most popular of the traditional styles of Japanese drama, with its star actors often appearing in television or film roles. Well-known onnagata actor Band\u014d Tamasabur\u014d V has appeared in several non-kabuki plays and movies, often in the role of a woman.\nKabuki also appears in works of Japanese popular culture such as anime. In addition to the handful of major theatres in Tokyo and Kyoto, there are many smaller theatres in Osaka and throughout the countryside. The \u014cshika Kabuki (\u5927\u9e7f\u6b4c\u821e\u4f0e) troupe, based in \u014cshika, Nagano Prefecture, is one example.\nSome local kabuki troupes today use female actors in onnagata roles. The Ichikawa Sh\u014djo Kabuki Gekidan, an all-female troupe, debuted in 1953 to significant acclaim, though the majority of kabuki troupes have remained entirely-male.\nThe introduction of earphone guides in 1975, including an English version in 1982, helped broaden the artform's appeal. As a result, in 1991 the Kabuki-za, one of Tokyo's best known kabuki theaters, began year-round performances and, in 2005, began marketing kabuki cinema films. Kabuki troupes regularly tour Asia, Europe and America, and there have been several kabuki-themed productions of Western plays such as those of Shakespeare. Western playwrights and novelists have also experimented with kabuki themes, an example of which is Gerald Vizenor's Hiroshima Bugi (2004). Writer Yukio Mishima pioneered and popularised the use of kabuki in modern settings and revived other traditional arts, such as Noh, adapting them to modern contexts. There have even been kabuki troupes established in countries outside Japan. For instance, in Australia, the Za Kabuki troupe at the Australian National University has performed a kabuki drama each year since 1976, the longest regular kabuki performance outside Japan.\nIn November 2002, a statue was erected in honor of kabuki's founder, Izumo no Okuni and to commemorate 400 years of kabuki's existence. Diagonally across from the Minami-za, the last remaining kabuki theater in Kyoto, it stands at the east end of a bridge (Shij\u014d \u014chashi) crossing the Kamo River in Kyoto.\nKabuki was inscribed on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists in 2005.\n\nSuper Kabuki\nWhile still maintaining most of the historical practices of kabuki, Ichikawa En-\u014d (\u5e02\u5ddd\u733f\u7fc1) aimed to broaden its appeal by creating a new genre of kabuki productions called \"Super Kabuki\" (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u6b4c\u821e\u4f0e). With Yamato Takeru (\u30e4\u30de\u30c8\u30bf\u30b1\u30eb) as the first Super Kabuki production to premiere in 1986, remakes of traditional plays and new contemporary creations have been brought to local theaters throughout the country, including anime-based productions such as Naruto or One Piece starting from 2014.\nSuper Kabuki has sparked controversy within the Japanese population regarding the extent of modification of the traditional art form. Some say that it has lost its 400-year history, while others consider the adaptations necessary for contemporary relevance. Regardless, since incorporating more advanced technology in the new stage sets, costumes, and lighting, Super Kabuki has regained interest from the young demographic.\nIn addition, Square Enix announced a Super Kabuki adaptation of Final Fantasy X collaborating with Tokyo Broadcasting System in 2022. Entitled Kinoshita Group presents New Kabuki Final Fantasy X and part of celebrations of the Final Fantasy franchise's 35th anniversary, it is scheduled to be performed at the IHI Stage Around Tokyo from March 4 to April 12, 2023.\n\nElements\nStage design\nThe kabuki stage features a projection called a hanamichi (\u82b1\u9053, \"flower path\"), a walkway which extends into the audience and via which dramatic entrances and exits are made. Okuni also performed on a hanamichi stage with her entourage. The stage is used not only as a walkway or path to get to and from the main stage, but important scenes are also played on the stage.\nKabuki stages and theaters have steadily become more technologically sophisticated, and innovations including revolving stages and trap doors were introduced during the 18th century. A driving force has been the desire to manifest one frequent theme of kabuki theater, that of the sudden, dramatic revelation or transformation. A number of stage tricks, including actors' rapid appearance and disappearance, employ these innovations. The term keren (\u5916\u9023), often translated as \"playing to the gallery\", is sometimes used as a catch-all for these tricks. The hanamichi, and several innovations including revolving stage, seri and chunori have all contributed to kabuki. The hanamichi creates depth and both seri and chunori provide a vertical dimension.\nMawari-butai (revolving stage) developed in the Ky\u014dh\u014d era (1716\u20131735). The trick was originally accomplished by the on-stage pushing of a round, wheeled platform. Later a circular platform was embedded in the stage with wheels beneath it facilitating movement. The kuraten (\"darkened revolve\") technique involves lowering the stage lights during this transition. More commonly the lights are left on for akaten (\"lighted revolve\"), sometimes simultaneously performing the transitioning scenes for dramatic effect. This stage was first built in Japan in the early 18th century.\nSeri refers to the stage \"traps\" that have been commonly employed in kabuki since the middle of the 18th century. These traps raise and lower actors or sets to the stage. Seridashi or seriage refers to trap(s) moving upward and serisage or serioroshi to traps descending. This technique is often used to lift an entire scene at once.\n\n \n\nCh\u016bnori (riding in mid-air) is a technique, which appeared toward the middle of the 19th century, by which an actor's costume is attached to wires and he is made to \"fly\" over the stage or certain parts of the auditorium. This is similar to the wire trick in the stage musical Peter Pan, in which Peter launches himself into the air. It is still one of the most popular keren (visual tricks) in kabuki today; major kabuki theaters, such as the National Theatre, Kabuki-za and Minami-za, are all equipped with ch\u016bnori installations.\nScenery changes are sometimes made mid-scene, while the actors remain on stage and the curtain stays open. This is sometimes accomplished by using a Hiki D\u014dgu, or \"small wagon stage\". This technique originated at the beginning of the 18th century, where scenery or actors move on or off stage on a wheeled platform. Also common are stagehands rushing onto the stage adding and removing props, backdrops and other scenery; these kuroko (\u9ed2\u5b50) are always dressed entirely in black and are traditionally considered invisible. Stagehands also assist in a variety of quick costume changes known as hayagawari (\"quick change technique\").\nWhen a character's true nature is suddenly revealed, the devices of hikinuki and bukkaeri are often used. This involves layering one costume over another and having a stagehand pull the outer one off in front of the audience.\nThe curtain that shields the stage before the performance and during the breaks is in the traditional colours of black, red and green, in various order, or white instead of green, vertical stripes. The curtain consists of one piece and is pulled back to one side by a staff member by hand.\nAn additional outer curtain called doncho was not introduced until the Meiji era following the introduction of western influence. These are more ornate in their appearance and are woven. They depict the season in which the performance is taking place, often designed by renowned Nihonga artists.\n\nAppearances\nSince feudal laws in 17th century Japan prohibited replicating the looks of samurai or nobility and the use of luxurious fabrics, the kabuki costumes were groundbreaking new designs to the general public, even setting trends that still exist today.\nAlthough the earliest kabuki costumes have not been preserved, separate otoko and onnagata kabuki costumes today are made based on written records called ukiyo-e and in collaboration with those whose families have been in the kabuki industry for generations. The kimono the actors wear for their costumes are typically made with vibrant colours and multiple layers. Both otoko and onnagata wear hakama - pleated trousers \u2013 in some plays, and both use padding underneath their costumes to create the correct body shape for the outfit.\nKabuki makeup provides an element of style easily recognizable even by those unfamiliar with the art form. Rice powder is used to create the white oshiroi base for the characteristic stage makeup, and kumadori enhances or exaggerates facial lines to produce dramatic animal or supernatural masks. The colour of the kumadori is an expression of the character's nature: red lines are used to indicate passion, heroism, righteousness, and other positive traits; blue or black, villainy, jealousy, and other negative traits; green, the supernatural; and purple, nobility.\nAnother special feature of kabuki costumes is the katsura, or the wig. Each actor has a different wig made for every role, constructed from a thin base of hand-beaten copper custom-made to fit the actor perfectly, and each wig is usually styled in a traditional manner. The hair used in the wigs is typically real human hair hand-sewn onto a habotai base, though some styles of wig require yak hair or horse hair.\n\nPerformance\nThe three main categories of kabuki play are jidaimono (\u6642\u4ee3\u7269, historical or pre-Sengoku period stories), sewamono (\u4e16\u8a71\u7269, \"domestic\" or post-Sengoku period stories), and shosagoto (\u6240\u4f5c\u4e8b, \"dance pieces\").\nJidaimono, or history plays, are set within the context of major events in Japanese history. Strict censorship laws during the Edo period prohibited the representation of contemporary events and particularly prohibited criticising the shogunate or casting it in a bad light, although enforcement varied greatly over the years. Many shows were set in the context of the Genpei War of the 1180s, the Nanboku-ch\u014d Wars of the 1330s, or other historical events. Frustrating the censors, many shows used these historical settings as metaphors for contemporary events. Kanadehon Ch\u016bshingura, one of the most famous plays in the kabuki repertoire, serves as an excellent example; it is ostensibly set in the 1330s, though it actually depicts the contemporary (18th century) affair of the revenge of the 47 r\u014dnin.\n\nUnlike jidaimono, which generally focused upon the samurai class, sewamono focused primarily upon commoners, namely townspeople and peasants. Often referred to as \"domestic plays\" in English, sewamono generally related to themes of family drama and romance. Some of the most famous sewamono are the love suicide plays, adapted from works by the bunraku playwright Chikamatsu; these center on romantic couples who cannot be together in life due to various circumstances and who therefore decide to be together in death instead. Many if not most sewamono contain significant elements of this theme of societal pressures and limitations.\nShosagoto pieces place their emphasis on dance, which may be performed with or without dialogue, where dance can be used to convey emotion, character and plot. Quick costume change techniques may sometimes be employed in such pieces. Notable examples include Musume D\u014dj\u014dji and Renjishi. Nagauta musicians may be seated in rows on stepped platforms behind the dancers.\nImportant elements of kabuki include the mie (\u898b\u5f97), in which the actor holds a picturesque pose to establish his character. At this point his house name (yag\u014d (\u5c4b\u53f7)) is sometimes heard in loud shout (kakegoe (\u639b\u3051\u58f0)) from an expert audience member, serving both to express and enhance the audience's appreciation of the actor's achievement. An even greater compliment can be paid by shouting the name of the actor's father.\nThe main actor has to convey a wide variety of emotions between a fallen, drunkard person and someone who in reality is quite different since he is only faking his weakness, such as the character of Yuranosuke in Ch\u016bshingura. This is called hara-gei or \"belly acting\", which means he has to perform from within to change characters. It is technically difficult to perform and takes a long time to learn, but once mastered the audience takes up on the actor's emotion.\nEmotions are also expressed through the colours of the costumes, a key element in kabuki. Gaudy and strong colours can convey foolish or joyful emotions, whereas severe or muted colours convey seriousness and focus.\n\nPlay structure and performance style\nKabuki, like other forms of drama traditionally performed in Japan, was\u2014and sometimes still is\u2014performed in full-day programmes, with one play comprising a number of acts spanning the entire day. However, these plays\u2014particularly sewamono\u2014were commonly sequenced with acts from other plays in order to produce a full-day programme, as the individual acts in a kabuki play commonly functioned as stand-alone performances in and of themselves. Sewamono plays, in contrast, were generally not sequenced with acts from other plays, and genuinely would take the entire day to perform.\nThe structure of a full-day performance was derived largely from the conventions of both bunraku and Noh theatre. Chief amongst these was the concept of jo-ha-ky\u016b (\u5e8f\u7834\u6025), a pacing convention in theatre stating that the action of a play should start slow, speed up, and end quickly. The concept, elaborated on at length by master Noh playwright Zeami, governs not only the actions of the actors, but also the structure of the play, as well as the structure of scenes and plays within a day-long programme.\nNearly every full-length play occupies five acts. The first corresponds to jo, an auspicious and slow opening which introduces the audience to the characters and the plot. The next three acts correspond to ha, where events speed up, culminating almost always in a great moment of drama or tragedy in the third act, and possibly a battle in the second or fourth acts. The final act, corresponding to ky\u016b, is almost always short, providing a quick and satisfying conclusion.\n\nWhile many plays were written solely for kabuki, many others were taken from j\u014druri plays, Noh plays, folklore, or other performing traditions such as the oral tradition of the Tale of the Heike. While j\u014druri plays tend to have serious, emotionally dramatic, and organised plots, plays written specifically for kabuki generally have looser, more humorous plots.\nOne crucial difference between j\u014druri and kabuki is a difference in storytelling focus; whereas j\u014druri focuses on the story and on the chanter who recites it, kabuki has a greater focus on the actors themselves. A j\u014druri play may sacrifice the details of sets, puppets, or action in favor of the chanter, while kabuki is known to sacrifice drama and even the plot to highlight an actor's talents. It was not uncommon in kabuki to insert or remove individual scenes from a day's schedule in order to cater to an individual actor\u2014either scenes he was famed for, or that featured him, would be inserted into a program without regard to plot continuity. Certain plays were also performed uncommonly as they required an actor to be proficient in a number of instruments, which would be played live onstage, a skill that few actors possessed.\nKabuki traditions in Edo and the Kyoto-Osaka region (Kamigata) differed; throughout the Edo period, Edo kabuki was defined by its extravagance, both in the appearance of its actors, their costumes, stage tricks and bold mie poses. In contrast, Kamigata kabuki focused on natural and realistic styles of acting. Only towards the end of the Edo period did the two styles begin to merge to any significant degree. Before this time, actors from different regions often failed to adjust their acting styles when performing elsewhere, leading to unsuccessful performance tours outside of their usual region of performance.\n\nFamous plays\nWhile there are many famous plays known today, many of the most famous were written in the mid-Edo period, and were originally written for bunraku theatre.\n\nKanadehon Ch\u016bshingura (Treasury of Loyal Retainers) is the famous story of the forty-seven r\u014dnin, led by Oishi Kuranosuke, who exact revenge on their enemy before committing suicide upon the death of their master, Lord Takuminokami of the Asano clan. This story is one of the most popular traditional tales in Japan, and is based on a famous episode in 18th century Japanese history.\nYoshitsune Senbon Zakura (Yoshitsune and the Thousand Cherry Trees) follows Minamoto no Yoshitsune as he flees from agents of his brother Yoritomo. Three Taira clan generals supposedly killed in the Genpei War figure prominently, as their deaths ensure a complete end to the war and the arrival of peace, as does a kitsune named Genkur\u014d.\nSugawara Denju Tenarai Kagami (Sugawara and the Secrets of Calligraphy) is based on the life of famed scholar Sugawara no Michizane (845\u2013903), who is exiled from Kyoto, and upon his death causes a number of calamities in the capital. He is then deified, as Tenjin, kami (\"divine spirit\") of scholarship, and worshipped in order to propitiate his angry spirit.\n\nActors\nEvery kabuki actor has a stage name, which is different from the name they were born with. These stage names, most often those of the actor's father, grandfather, or teacher, are passed down between generations of actors' lineages, and hold great honor and importance. Many names are associated with certain roles or acting styles, and the new possessor of each name must live up to these expectations; there is the feeling almost of the actor not only taking a name, but embodying the spirit, style, or skill of each actor to previously hold that name. Many actors will go through at least three names over the course of their career.\nSh\u016bmei (\u8972\u540d, \"name succession\") are grand naming ceremonies held in kabuki theatres in front of the audience. Most often, a number of actors will participate in a single ceremony, taking on new stage-names. Their participation in a sh\u016bmei represents their passage into a new chapter of their performing careers.\nKabuki actors are typically part of a school of acting, or are associated with a particular theatre.\n\nMajor theatres\nAkita\nKosaka\nTokyo\nKabuki-za\nMeiji-za\nShinbashi Enbuj\u014d\nNational Theater\nKyoto\nMinami-za\nOsaka\nShin-Kabuki-za (\u65b0\u6b4c\u821e\u4f0e\u5ea7 (\u5927\u962a))\nOsaka Sh\u014dchiku-za (\u5927\u962a\u677e\u7af9\u5ea7)\nNagoya\nMisono-za\nSuehiro-za\nFukuoka\nHakata-za\nKagawa\nKotohira Kanamaru-za\n\nInfluence of kabuki on other art forms\nSince its beginning, kabuki has remained a significant piece of Japanese culture. The stories and actors have been recreated in many different art forms, including woodblock prints, books, magazines, oral storytelling, photography in later years, and others. Additionally, kabuki was and continues to be influenced by the books and stories circulating in Japan. In one such instance, the widely popular book Nans\u014d Satomi Hakkenden, or Eight Dogs, was acted out in various episodes on the kabuki stage.\nOne important way the laboring class was able to enjoy kabuki performances outside of the stage was through home-brewed shows called Noson kabuki (\u8fb2\u6751\u6b4c\u821e\u4f0e, \"village kabuki\"). Also referred to as \"amateur kabuki\", these performances took place at the local level across Japan, but were most commonly held in the Gifu and Aichi prefectures. In Gifu Prefecture specifically, noson kabuki was a prominent feature of the annual autumn festival, with children's reenactments of kabuki performances taking place at Murakuni shrine for over 300 years.\nCloser to the cultural epicenter of kabuki in Edo (later Tokyo), commoners had other methods to enjoy performances without attending the shows. Bunraku (\u6587\u697d, puppet theatre) was a type of performance shorter in length and more affordable to the common class than kabuki. Bunraku performances were often based on plots used in kabuki, and the two styles shared common themes. Kabuki shinp\u014d (\u6b4c\u821e\u4f0e\u65b0\u5831, \"Kabuki news\") was another popular medium for kabuki consumption among commoners and elites alike. During the course of its publication, this magazine allowed those unable to attend performances to enjoy the liveliness of kabuki culture.\n\nSee also\nTheatre of Japan\nKanteiry\u016b, a lettering style invented to advertise kabuki and other theatrical performances\nKy\u014dgen, a traditional form of Japanese comic theatre that influenced the development of kabuki\nOshiguma, an imprint of the face make-up of kabuki actors, as artwork and souvenir\nNoh, a traditional form of Japanese theatre\nBunraku, a traditional Japanese puppet theatre from whose scripts many kabuki plays were adapted\nFamous kabuki actor lineages, such as:\nIchikawa Danj\u016br\u014d\nIchikawa Ebiz\u014d\nMatsumoto K\u014dshir\u014d\nNakamura Kanzabur\u014d\nKataoka Nizaemon\nKabuki shinp\u014d, a Japanese magazine on kabuki that ran 1879\u20131897.\nSgt.

In addition to regular appearances in the films of Akira Kurosawa, he worked for directors such as Mikio Naruse, Yasujir\u014d Ozu, Heinosuke Gosho and others.\n\nEarly life and career\nFujiwara was born on 15 January 1905 in Tokyo, Japan. Fujiwara had initially focused on music before he became known as a comic actor  After performing in Asakusa operas, a popular form of opera during the Taish\u014d era until its decline after the Great Kant\u014d earthquake, he joined Ken'ichi Enomoto's New Casino Folies. Enomoto's troupe performed satirical stage shows in an era often associated with the term ero guro nansensu or \"Erotic Grotesque Nonsense\" era.\nFujiwara gave his film debut in the 1933 film Ongaku kigeki \u2013 Horoyui jinsei (lit. \"Musical comedy \u2013 Intoxicated life\"), the first production of the P.C.L. studios (later Toho). Most of Fujiwara's later films were Toho productions. He married actress Sadako Sawamura in 1936 (divorced in 1946). In the late 1930s, Fujiwara found himself in trouble with the nationalist government. The authorities were pushing for artists and high profile individuals to change their names to the traditional spelling, and he was under official censure to do so. Despite this, he kept his name.\n\nPost-war career\nFujiwara's shomin persona always was that of a real-life person. Generally he played the role of an ordinary subject-citizen:  petty, conservative, mediocre, far from being handsome or rich. Over time he made this his specialty.\nHe made his first appearance in an Akira Kurosawa film in the 1952 Ikiru, playing the role of Senkichi, and became a long-time member of Kurosawa's company of actors until his death. Other films with Kurosawa include Seven Samurai, The Lower Depths, The Hidden Fortress and Yojimbo. In addition to Kurosawa, Fujiwara regularly appeared in the films of Mikio Naruse, with whom he had worked since the mid-1930s in films like Wife! Be Like a Rose!, and had roles in Heinosuke Gosho's An Inn at Osaka and Yasujir\u014d Ozu's Tokyo Twilight. He also started appearing on TV in the 1950s, including the series Ayu no uta. \nIn 1981, Fujiwara received the Order of the Sacred Treasure, 4th Class. His final film role was in Juzo Itami's The Funeral. He died in 1985 at the age of 80.\n\nLegacy\nThe peasant duo in Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress, played by Minoru Chiaki and Fujiwara, has repeatedly been cited as inspiration for the robot characters C-3PO and R2-D2 in Star Wars.\n\nSelected filmography\nReferences\nExternal links\nKamatari Fujiwara at IMDb","99":"Kagirinaki Zenshin (\u9650\u308a\u306a\u304d\u524d\u9032, lit. \"Limitless advance\") is a 1937 Japanese drama film by Tomu Uchida based on an original idea by Yasujir\u014d Ozu.\n\nPlot\nThe protagonist, Tokumaru, is laid off from his corporate job.

He is one of the most critically acclaimed contemporary fiction authors writing in English, having been awarded the 2017 Nobel Prize in Literature. In its citation, the Swedish Academy described Ishiguro as a writer \"who, in novels of great emotional force, has uncovered the abyss beneath our illusory sense of connection with the world\".\nIshiguro was born in Nagasaki, Japan, and moved to Britain in 1960 with his parents when he was five. His first two novels, A Pale View of Hills and An Artist of the Floating World, were noted for their explorations of Japanese identity and their mournful tone. He thereafter explored other genres, including science fiction and historical fiction.\nHe has been nominated for the Booker Prize four times, winning in 1989 for The Remains of the Day, which was adapted into a film of the same name in 1993. Salman Rushdie praised the novel as Ishiguro's masterpiece, in which he \"turned away from the Japanese settings of his first two novels and revealed that his sensibility was not rooted in any one place, but capable of travel and metamorphosis\".\nTime named Ishiguro's science fiction novel Never Let Me Go as the best novel of 2005 and one of the 100 best English-language novels published between 1923 and 2005. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for the 2022 film Living.\n\nEarly life and education\nIshiguro was born in Nagasaki, Japan, on 8 November 1954, the son of Shizuo Ishiguro, a physical oceanographer, and his wife, Shizuko. In 1960, Ishiguro moved with his family to Guildford, Surrey, as his father was invited for research at the National Institute of Oceanography (now the National Oceanography Centre). He did not return to visit Japan until 1989, nearly 30 years later, when he was a participant in the Japan Foundation Short-Term Visitors' Programme.\nIn an interview with Kenzabur\u014d \u014ce, Ishiguro stated that the Japanese settings of his first two novels were imaginary: \"I grew up with a very strong image in my head of this other country, a very important other country to which I had a strong emotional tie \u2026 In England I was all the time building up this picture in my head, an imaginary Japan.\"\nIshiguro, who has been described as a British Asian author, explained in a BBC interview how growing up in a Japanese family in the UK was crucial to his writing, enabling him to see things from a different perspective from that of many of his English peers.\nHe attended Stoughton Primary School and then Woking County Grammar School in Surrey. Ishiguro sang solos as a choirboy with his church and school choirs. He also enjoyed music as a teenager, listening to the likes of Leonard Cohen, Joni Mitchell, and particularly Bob Dylan. Ishiguro began learning guitar and writing songs, initially aiming to become a professional songwriter. He says that \"for me there's always been big overlap between fiction and song. My style as a novelist comes substantially from what I learnt writing songs. The intimate, first-person quality of a singer performing to an audience, for instance, carried over for me into novels. As did the need to approach meaning subtly, sometimes by nudging it into the spaces between the lines.\" After finishing school in 1973, he took a gap year and traveled through the United States and Canada, writing a journal and sending demo tapes to record companies. He also worked as a grouse beater, a practice of driven grouse shooting, at Balmoral Castle. Ishiguro later reflected on his ephemeral songwriting career, saying, \"I used to see myself as some sort of musician type but there came a point when I thought: actually, this isn't me at all. I'm much less glamorous. I'm one of these people with corduroy jackets with elbow patches. It was a real comedown.\"\nIn 1974, he began studies at the University of Kent at Canterbury, graduating in 1978 with a Bachelor of Arts (honours) in English and philosophy. After spending a year writing fiction, he resumed his studies at the University of East Anglia where he studied with Malcolm Bradbury and Angela Carter on the UEA Creative Writing Course, gaining the degree of Master of Arts in 1980. His thesis became his first novel, A Pale View of Hills, published in 1982.\nHe gained British citizenship in 1983.\n\nCareer\n1982\u20131994: Literary beginnings and breakthrough\nIshiguro set his first two novels in Japan; however, in several interviews, he said that he has little familiarity with Japanese writing and that his works bear little resemblance to Japanese fiction. An Artist of the Floating World (1986) is set in an unnamed Japanese city during the Occupation of Japan following the nation's surrender in 1945. The narrator is forced to come to terms with his part in World War II. He finds himself blamed by the new generation who accuse him of being part of Japan's misguided foreign policy, and is forced to confront the ideals of the modern times as represented by his grandson. Ishiguro said of his choice of time period, \"I tend to be attracted to pre-war and postwar settings because I'm interested in this business of values and ideals being tested, and people having to face up to the notion that their ideals weren't quite what they thought they were before the test came.\"\nIn an interview in 1989, when discussing his Japanese heritage and its influence on his upbringing, he stated, \"I'm not entirely like English people because I've been brought up by Japanese parents in a Japanese-speaking home. My parents (...) felt responsible for keeping me in touch with Japanese values. I do have a distinct background. I think differently, my perspectives are slightly different.\" In a 1990 interview, Ishiguro said, \"If I wrote under a pseudonym and got somebody else to pose for my jacket photographs, I'm sure nobody would think of saying, 'This guy reminds me of that Japanese writer.'\" Although some Japanese writers have had a distant influence on his writing\u2014Jun'ichir\u014d Tanizaki is the one he most frequently cites\u2014Ishiguro has said that Japanese films, especially those of Yasujir\u014d Ozu and Mikio Naruse, have been a more significant influence.\nIn 1989 he released his book The Remains of the Day, set in the large country house of an English lord in the period surrounding World War II. The book received widespread acclaim as well as the Booker Prize for Fiction. The novel was adapted by Merchant Ivory and made into a 1993 film of the same name starring Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson.\n\n1995\u20132018: Established career and acclaim\nHis fourth novel, The Unconsoled (1995), takes place in an unnamed Central European city. It received the Cheltenham Prize for Literature. A 2006 poll of various literary critics voted the novel as the third \"best British, Irish, or Commonwealth novel from 1980 to 2005\", tied with Anthony Burgess's Earthly Powers, Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children, Ian McEwan's Atonement, and Penelope Fitzgerald's The Blue Flower.\nSome of Ishiguro's novels are set in the past. Never Let Me Go (2005) has science fiction qualities and a futuristic tone; however, it is set in the 1980s and 1990s, and takes place in a parallel world very similar to ours. Time magazine named it the best novel of 2005 and included the novel in its \"100 Best English-language novels published since 1923\". The novel was adapted into the 2010 film of the same name starring Keira Knightley, Andrew Garfield, and Carey Mulligan. With the exception of The Buried Giant (2015), Ishiguro's novels are written in the first-person narrative style.\n\nIn 2017, Ishiguro was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, with the motivation \"in novels of great emotional force, [he] has uncovered the abyss beneath our illusory sense of connection with the world\". In response to receiving the award, Ishiguro stated:It's a magnificent honour, mainly because it means that I'm in the footsteps of the greatest authors that have lived, so that's a terrific commendation. The world is in a very uncertain moment and I would hope all the Nobel Prizes would be a force for something positive in the world as it is at the moment. I'll be deeply moved if I could in some way be part of some sort of climate this year in contributing to some sort of positive atmosphere at a very uncertain time. Ishiguro was appointed Knight Bachelor for services to literature in the 2018 Birthday Honours.\n\n2021\u2013present: Klara and the Sun and Living\nIshiguro's eighth novel, Klara and the Sun, was published by Faber and Faber on 2 March 2021. Rumaan Alam of The New Republic wrote it is \"more simple than it seems, less novel than parable.\" It was longlisted for the 2021 Booker Prize. In the novel he discusses subjects such as the dangers of technological advancement, the future of our world, and the meaning of being human that he also broached in his earlier books.\nIshiguro adapted the screenplay for the 2022 British film Living, directed by Oliver Hermanus and starring Bill Nighy, from the 1952 Japanese film Ikiru directed by Akira Kurosawa. In 2023, Living was nominated for an Academy Award in the Best Adapted Screenplay category.\n\nMusical work\nIshiguro has co-written several songs for the jazz singer Stacey Kent with Kent's husband, saxophonist Jim Tomlinson. Ishiguro contributed lyrics to Kent's 2007 Grammy-nominated album Breakfast on the Morning Tram, including its title track, her 2011 album, Dreamer in Concert, her 2013 album The Changing Lights, and her 2017 album, I Know I Dream. Ishiguro also wrote the liner notes to Kent's 2002 album In Love Again. Ishiguro first met Kent after he chose her recording of \"They Can't Take That Away from Me\" as one of his Desert Island Discs in 2002 and Kent subsequently asked him to write for her.\nIshiguro has said of his lyric writing that \"with an intimate, confiding, first-person song, the meaning must not be self-sufficient on the page. It has to be oblique, sometimes you have to read between the lines\" and that this realisation has had an \"enormous influence\" on his fiction writing.\nIn March, 2024, Faber & Faber published Ishiguro's book, The Summer We Crossed Europe in the Rain: Lyrics for Stacey Kent, a collection of 16 of his lyrics for Kent, with illustrations by Italian-French artist, Bianca Bagnarelli.\n\nInfluences\nIshiguro counts Dostoyevsky and Proust among his influences. His works have also been compared to Salman Rushdie, Jane Austen, and Henry James, though Ishiguro himself rejects these comparisons. When asked who is his favorite novelist is, he says \"Charlotte Bront\u00eb's recently edged out Dostoevsky...I owe my career, and a lot else besides, to Jane Eyre and Villette.\"\n\nPersonal life\nIshiguro has been married to Lorna MacDougall, a social worker, since 1986. They met at the West London Cyrenians homelessness charity in Notting Hill, where Ishiguro was working as a residential resettlement worker. The couple live in London. Their daughter, Naomi Ishiguro, is also an author, and published the book Escape Routes.\nHe describes himself as a \"serious cinephile\" and \"great admirer of Bob Dylan\". On Desert Island Discs, he chose Dylan's \"Trying to Get to Heaven\" as his favorite song. His book choice was the Collected Short Stories of Anton Chekhov.\n\nHonours and awards\nNational or state honours\n1995:  Appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire for services to literature\n1998:  Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government\n2018:  Order of the Rising Sun, 2nd Class, Gold and Silver Star by the Japanese government\n2018:  Appointed Knight Bachelor for services to literature\n\nLiterary awards\n1982: Winifred Holtby Memorial Prize for A Pale View of Hills\n1986: Whitbread Prize for An Artist of the Floating World\n1989: Booker Prize for The Remains of the Day\n2017: Nobel Prize in Literature\n2017: American Academy of Achievement's Golden Plate Award\n2019: Bodley Medal\nExcept for A Pale View of Hills and The Buried Giant, all of Ishiguro's novels and his short story collection have been shortlisted for major awards. Most significantly, An Artist of the Floating World, When We Were Orphans, and Never Let Me Go were all short-listed for the Booker Prize (as was The Remains of the Day, which won it). A leaked account of a judging committee's meeting revealed that the committee found itself deciding between Never Let Me Go and John Banville's The Sea before awarding the prize to the latter.\n\nOther distinctions\n1983: Published in the Granta Best Young British Novelists issue\n1993: Published in the Granta Best Young British Novelists issue\n2005: Never Let Me Go named on Time magazine's list of the 100 greatest English language novels since the magazine's formation in 1923.\n2008: The Times ranked Ishiguro 32nd on their list of \"The 50 Greatest British Writers Since 1945\".\n2023: Living was nominated for the 2023 Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.

It was first published three times a month, using the Japanese Jun (\u65ec) system of dividing months into three parts, but the postwar Kinema Junp\u014d has been published twice a month.\nThe magazine was founded by a group of four students, including Sabur\u014d Tanaka, at the Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Technical High School at the time). In that first month, it was published three times on days with a \"1\" in them. These first three issues were printed on art paper and had four pages each. Kinejun initially specialized in covering foreign films, in part because its writers sided with the principles of the Pure Film Movement and strongly criticized Japanese cinema. It later expanded coverage to films released in Japan. While long emphasizing film criticism, it has also served as a trade journal, reporting on the film industry in Japan and announcing new films and trends.\nAfter their building was destroyed in the Great Kant\u014d earthquake in September 1923, the Kinejun offices were moved to the city of Ashiya in the Hanshin area of Japan, though the main offices are now back in Tokyo.\nThe Kinema Junpo Best Ten awards began in 1924, their Best Ten lists are considered iconic and prestigious.

The film was written and shot during the Allied Powers' Occupation of Japan and was subject to the Occupation's official censorship requirements. Starring Chish\u016b Ry\u016b, who was featured in almost all of the director's films, and Setsuko Hara, marking her first of six appearances in Ozu's work, it is the first installment of Ozu\u2019s so-called \"Noriko trilogy\", succeeded by Early Summer (Bakushu, 1951) and Tokyo Story (Tokyo Monogatari, 1953); in each of which Hara portrays a young woman named Noriko, though the three Norikos are distinct, unrelated characters, linked primarily by their status as single women in postwar Japan.\nLate Spring belongs to the type of Japanese cinema known as shomin-geki, a genre that deals with the ordinary daily lives of working class and middle class people of modern times. The film is frequently regarded as the first in the director's final creative period, \"the major prototype of the [director's] 1950s and 1960s work\". These films are characterized by, among other traits, an exclusive focus on stories about families during Japan's immediate postwar era, a tendency towards very simple plots and the use of a generally static camera.\nLate Spring was released on September 19, 1949, to critical acclaim in the Japanese press. In the following year, it was awarded the prestigious Kinema Junpo critics' award as the best Japanese production released in 1949. In 1972, the film was commercially released in the United States, again to very positive reviews. Late Spring has been referred to as the director's \"most perfect\" work, as \"the definitive film of Ozu's master filmmaking approach and language\" and has been called \"one of the most perfect, most complete, and most successful studies of character ever achieved in Japanese cinema\". In the 2012 version of Sight & Sound's decennial poll of \"The Greatest Films of All Time\", published by the British Film Institute (BFI), Late Spring appears as the second highest-ranking Japanese-language film on the list at number 15, behind Ozu's own Tokyo Story at number 3.\n\nPlot\nThe film opens at a tea ceremony. Professor Shukichi Somiya (Chishu Ryu), a widower, has only one child, a twenty-seven-year-old unmarried daughter, Noriko (Setsuko Hara), who takes care of the household and the everyday needs\u2014cooking, cleaning, mending, etc.\u2014of her father. On a shopping trip to Tokyo, Noriko encounters one of her father's friends, Professor Jo Onodera (Masao Mishima), who lives in Kyoto. Noriko knows that Onodera, who had been a widower like her father, has recently remarried, and she tells him that she finds the very idea of his remarriage distasteful, even \"filthy.\" Onodera, and later her father, tease her for having such thoughts.\n\nShukichi's sister, Aunt Masa (Haruko Sugimura), convinces him that it is high time his daughter got married. Noriko is friendly with her father\u2019s assistant, Hattori (Jun Usami), and Aunt Masa suggests that her brother ask Noriko if she might be interested in Hattori. When he does bring up the subject, however, Noriko laughs: Hattori has been engaged to another young woman for quite some time.\nUndaunted, Masa pressures Noriko to meet with a marriageable young man, a Tokyo University graduate named Satake who, Masa believes, bears a strong resemblance to Gary Cooper. Noriko declines, explaining that she does not wish to marry anyone, because to do so would leave her father alone and helpless. Masa surprises Noriko by claiming that she is also trying to arrange a match between Shukichi and Mrs. Miwa (Kuniko Miyake), an attractive young widow known to Noriko. If Masa succeeds, Noriko would have no excuse.\nAt a Noh performance attended by Noriko and her father, the latter smilingly greets Mrs. Miwa, which triggers Noriko's jealousy. When her father later tries to talk her into going to meet Satake, he tells her that he intends to marry Mrs. Miwa. Devastated, Noriko reluctantly decides to meet the young man and, to her surprise, has a very favorable impression of him. Under pressure from all sides, Noriko consents to the arranged marriage.\nThe Somiyas go on one last trip together before the wedding, visiting Kyoto. There they meet Professor Onodera and his family. Noriko changes her opinion of Onodera's remarriage when she discovers that his new wife is a nice person. While packing their luggage for the trip home, Noriko asks her father why they cannot simply stay as they are now, even if he does remarry \u2013 she cannot imagine herself any happier than living with and taking care of him. Shukichi admonishes her, saying that she must embrace the new life she will build with Satake, one in which he, Shukichi, will have no part, because \"that\u2019s the order of human life and history.\" Noriko asks her father\u2019s forgiveness for her \"selfishness\" and agrees to go ahead with the marriage.\nNoriko\u2019s wedding day arrives. At home just before the ceremony, both Shukichi and Masa admire Noriko, who is dressed in a traditional wedding costume. Noriko thanks her father for the care he has taken of her throughout her life and leaves in a hired car for the wedding. Afterwards, Aya (Yumeji Tsukioka), a divorced friend of Noriko\u2019s, goes with Shukichi to a bar, where he confesses that his claim that he was going to marry Mrs. Miwa was a ruse to persuade Noriko to get married herself. Aya, touched by his sacrifice, promises to visit him often. Shukichi returns home alone.\n\nCast\nProduction\nThe Occupation censorship\nCensorship problems with Late Spring\nThe central event of Late Spring is the marriage of the heroine to a man she has met only once through a single arranged meeting. This immediately presented a problem for the censors of the American Occupation. According to film scholar Kyoko Hirano, these officials \"considered feudalistic the Japanese custom of arranged meetings for prospective marriage partners, miai, because the custom seemed to them to downgrade the importance of the individual.\" Hirano notes that, had this policy against showing arranged marriages onscreen been rigidly enforced, Late Spring could never have been made. In the original synopsis (which the filmmakers were required to submit to the censorship before production could be approved), Noriko\u2019s decision to marry was presented as a collective family decision, not an individual choice, and the censors apparently rejected this.\nThe synopsis explained that the trip to Kyoto by father and daughter, just prior to Noriko\u2019s marriage, occurs so she can visit her dead mother\u2019s grave. This motivation is absent from the finished film, possibly because the censors would have interpreted such a visit as \u201cancestor worship,\u201d a practice they frowned upon.\nAny reference in the script to the devastation caused by the Allied bombings was removed. In the script, Shukichi remarks to Onodera\u2019s wife in Kyoto that her city is a very nice place, unlike Tokyo, with all its ruins. The censors deleted the reference to ruins (as an implied critique of the Allies) and, in the finished film, the word \u201chokorippoi\u201d (\u201cdusty\u201d) was substituted as a description of Tokyo.\nThe censors at first automatically deleted a reference in the script to the Hollywood star Gary Cooper, but then reinstated it when they realized that the comparison was to Noriko\u2019s (unseen) suitor Satake, who is described by the female characters as attractive, and was thus flattering to the American actor.\nSometimes, the censors\u2019 demands seemed irrational. A line about Noriko\u2019s health having been negatively affected by \"her work after being conscripted by the [Japanese] Navy during the war\" was changed to \"the forced work during the war,\" as if even the very mention of the Japanese Navy was somehow suspect.\nAt the script phase of the censorship process, the censors demanded that the character of Aunt Masa, who at one point finds a lost change purse on the ground and keeps it as a kind of good-luck charm, should be shown handing over the purse to the police. Ozu responded by turning the situation, in the finished film, into a kind of running gag in which Shukichi repeatedly (and futilely) urges his sister to turn the purse in to the police. This change has been called \"a mocking kind of partial compliance with the censorship.\"\n\nOzu's alleged \"subversion\" of censorship\nOne scholar, Lars-Martin Sorensen, has claimed that Ozu's partial aim in making the film was to present an ideal of Japan at odds with that which the Occupation wanted to promote, and that he successfully subverted the censorship in order to accomplish this. \"The controversial and subversive politico-historical 'message' of the film is\u2026 that the beauty of tradition, and of subjugation of individual whims to tradition and history, by far outshines the imported and imposed western trends of occupied Japan.\"\n\nSorensen uses as an example the scene early in the film in which Noriko and her father's assistant Hattori are bicycling towards the beach. They pass a diamond-shaped Coca-Cola sign and another sign, in English, warning that the weight capacity of a bridge over which they are riding is 30 tons: quite irrelevant information for this young couple, but perfectly appropriate for American military vehicles that might pass along that road. (Neither the Coke sign nor the road warning are referred to in the script approved by the censors.) Sorensen argues that these objects are \"obvious reference(s) to the presence of the occupying army.\"\nOn the other hand, Late Spring, more than any other film Ozu made, is suffused with the symbols of Japanese tradition: the tea ceremony that opens the film, the temples at Kamakura, the Noh performance that Noriko and Shukichi witness, and the landscape and Zen gardens of Kyoto. Sorensen argues that these images of historical landmarks \"were intended to inspire awe and respect for the treasures of ancient Japan in contrast to the impurity of the present.\" Sorensen also claims that, to Ozu\u2019s audience, \"the exaltation of Japanese tradition and cultural and religious heritage must have brought remembrances of the good old days when Japan was still winning her battles abroad and nationalism reached its peak.\" To scholars such as Bordwell who assert that Ozu was promoting with this film an ideology that could be called liberal, Sorensen argues that contemporary reviews of the film \"show that Ozu (the director and his personal convictions) was considered inseparable from his films, and that he was considered a conservative purist.\"\nSorensen concludes that such censorship may not necessarily be a bad thing. \"One of the positive side effects of being prohibited from airing one's views openly and directly is that it forces artists to be creative and subtle in their ways of expression.\"\n\nOzu's collaborators\nOn Late Spring, Ozu worked with a number of old colleagues from his prewar days, such as actor Chishu Ryu and cinematographer Yuharu Atsuta. However, a long-deferred reunion with one artist and the beginning of a long collaboration with another\u2014the screenwriter Kogo Noda and the actress Setsuko Hara, respectively\u2014were to prove critical artistically, both to this work and to the direction of Ozu's subsequent career.\n\nKogo Noda\nKogo Noda, already an accomplished screenwriter, had collaborated with Ozu on the script of his debut film of 1927, Sword of Penitence. Noda had later written scripts with Ozu (while also collaborating with other directors) on many of his best silent pictures, including Tokyo Chorus. Yet by 1949, the director had not worked with his old friend for fourteen years. However, their reunion on Late Spring was so harmonious and successful that Ozu wrote exclusively with Noda for the rest of his career.\nOzu once said of Noda: \"When a director works with a scriptwriter they must have some characteristics and habits in common; otherwise, they won't get along. My daily life\u2014what time I get up, how much sake I drink and so on\u2014is in almost complete agreement with that of [Noda]. When I work with Noda, we collaborate even on short bits of dialogue. Although we never discuss the details of the sets or costumes, his mental image of these things is always in accord with mine; our ideas never criss cross or go awry. We even agree on whether a dialogue should end with wa or yo.\" From Late Spring on, partly due to Noda's influence, all Ozu\u2019s characters would be comfortably middle class and thus, unlike the characters in, for example, Record of a Tenement Gentleman or A Hen in the Wind, beyond immediate physical want and necessity.\n\nSetsuko Hara\nSetsuko Hara (born Masae Aida in Yokohama, Kanagawa prefecture on June 17, 1920) had appeared in films since the mid-1930s, when she was in her teens. Her tall frame and strong facial features\u2014including very large eyes and a prominent nose\u2014were unusual among Japanese actresses at the time; it has been rumored, but not verified, that she has a German grandparent. She maintained her popularity throughout the war years, when she appeared in many films made for propaganda purposes by the military government, becoming \"the perfect war-movie heroine.\" After the defeat of Japan, she was more popular than ever, so that by the time Ozu worked with her for the first time on Late Spring, she had already become \"one of Japan's best-loved actresses.\"\nOzu had a very high regard for Hara's work. He said: \"Every Japanese actor can play the role of a soldier and every Japanese actress can play the role of a prostitute to some extent. However, it is rare to find an actress [like Hara] who can play the role of a daughter from a good family.\" Speaking of her performance in Early Summer, he was quoted as saying: \"Setsuko Hara is a really good actress. I wish I had four or five more like her.\"\nIn addition to the three \"Noriko\" films, Ozu directed her in three other roles: as an unhappily married wife in Tokyo Twilight (Tokyo Boshoku, 1957), as the mother of a marriageable daughter in Late Autumn (Akibiyori, 1960) and the daughter-in-law of a sake plant owner in the director's penultimate film, The End of Summer (Kohayagawa-ke no Aki, 1961). Bordwell summed up the critical consensus of Hara's significance to the late work of Ozu when he wrote: \"After 1948, Setsuko Hara becomes the archetypal Ozu woman, either the bride-to-be or the widow of middle years.\"\n\nNarrative, themes and characterization\nNarrative strategies\nThe films of Yasujir\u014d Ozu are well known for their unusual approach to film narrative. Scenes that most filmmakers would consider obligatory (e.g., the wedding of Noriko) are often not shown at all, while apparently extraneous incidents (e.g., the concert attended by Hattori but not Noriko) are given seemingly inordinate prominence. Sometimes important narrative information is withheld not only from a major character, but from the viewer, such as the news of Hattori\u2019s engagement, about which neither Noriko\u2019s father nor the audience has any knowledge until Noriko, laughing, informs him. And at times, the filmmaker proceeds, within a scene, to jump from one time frame to another without transition, as when two establishing shots of some travelers waiting for a train on a platform lead to a third shot of the same train already on its way to Tokyo.\n\n\"Parametric\" narrative theory\nBordwell refers to Ozu\u2019s approach to narrative as \"parametric narration.\" By this term, Bordwell means that Ozu\u2019s \"overunified\" visual approach, characterized by its \u201cstylistic rigor,\u201d often provides the basis for \"playful deviation,\" including narrative playfulness. As Bordwell puts it somewhat more plainly, Ozu \"back[s] away from his own machinery in order to achieve humor and surprise.\" In his view, \"in narrative poetry, rhythm and rhyme need not completely subordinate themselves to the demand of telling the story; in art song or opera, 'autonomous' musical structures may require that the story grind to a halt while particular harmonic or melodic patterns work themselves out. Similarly, in some films, temporal or spatial qualities can lure us with a patterning that is not wholly dependent on representing fabula [i.e., story] information.\"\nBordwell points out that the opening scene of Late Spring \"begins at the railroad station, where the characters aren\u2019t. A later scene will do exactly the same thing, showing the train station before showing [the characters] already hurtling towards Tokyo\u2026 In Tokyo, [Professor] Onodera and Noriko discuss going to an art exhibit; cut to a sign for the exhibit, then to the steps of the art gallery; cut to the two in a bar, after they\u2019ve gone to the exhibit.\"\n\n\"Essentialist\" narrative theory\nTo Kathe Geist, Ozu\u2019s narrative methods reflect the artist's economy of means, not \"playfulness.\" \"His frequent use of repetition and [narrative] ellipsis do not 'impose their will' on Ozu\u2019s plots; they are his plots. By paying attention to what has been left out and to what is repeated, one arrives at Ozu\u2019s essential story.\"\nAs an example, Geist cites the scene in which Noriko and Hattori bicycle together to the beach and have a conversation there, an incident that appears to imply a budding romantic relationship between them. When Noriko slightly later reveals to her father that Hattori, before that bicycle trip, had already been engaged to another woman, \"we wonder\", writes Geist, \"why Ozu has wasted so much time on the 'wrong man' [for Noriko].\" However, the key to the beach scene\u2019s importance to the plot, according to Geist, is the dialogue between Hattori and Noriko, in which the latter tells him that she is \"the jealous type.\" This seemingly unlikely claim, given her affable nature, is later confirmed when she becomes bitterly jealous at her father\u2019s apparent plan to remarry. \"Her jealousy goads her into her own marriage and is thus the pivot on which the plot turns.\"\nGeist sums up her analysis of several major Ozu films of the postwar period by asserting that \"the narratives unfold with an astounding precision in which no shot and certainly no scene is wasted and all is overlayered with an intricate web of interlocking meaning.\"\n\nMajor themes\nThe following represents what some critics regard as important themes in this film.\n\nMarriage\nThe main theme of Late Spring is marriage: specifically, the persistent attempts by several characters in the film to get Noriko married. The marriage theme was a topical one for Japanese of the late 1940s. On January 1, 1948, a new law had been issued which allowed young people over twenty to marry consensually without parental permission for the first time. The Japanese Constitution of 1947 had made it much easier for a wife to divorce her husband; up until that time, it had been \"difficult, almost impossible\" to do so. Several commentators have pointed out that one reason why Noriko is still unmarried at the relatively late age of 27 is that many of the young men of her generation had been killed in the Second World War, leaving far fewer eligible potential partners for single young women.\nMarriage in this film, as well as many of Ozu\u2019s late films, is strongly associated with death. Prof. Onodera's daughter, for example, refers to marriage as \"life\u2019s graveyard.\" Geist writes: \"Ozu connects marriage and death in obvious and subtle ways in most of his late films\u2026 The comparison between weddings and funerals is not merely a clever device on Ozu\u2019s part, but is so fundamental a concept in Japanese culture that these ceremonies as well as those surrounding births have built-in similarities\u2026 The elegiac melancholy Ozu evokes at the end of Late Spring, Late Autumn, and An Autumn Afternoon arises only partly because the parents have been left alone\u2026 The sadness arises because the marriage of the younger generation inevitably reflects on the mortality of the older generation.\" Robin Wood stresses the marriage-death connection in commenting on the scene that takes place in the Somiya home just before the wedding ceremony. \"After everyone has left the room\u2026 [Ozu] ends the sequence with a shot of the empty mirror. Noriko is no longer even a reflection, she has disappeared from the narrative, she is no longer \u2018Noriko\u2019 but \u2018wife.\u2019 The effect is that of a death.\"\n\nTradition vs. modernity\nThe tension between tradition and modern pressures in relation to marriage\u2014and, by extension, within Japanese culture as a whole\u2014is one of the major conflicts Ozu portrays in the film. Sorensen indicates by several examples that what foods a character eats or even how he or she sits down (e.g., on tatami mats or Western-style chairs) reveals the relationship of that character to tradition. According to Pe\u00f1a, Noriko \"is the quintessential moga\u2014modan gaaru, 'modern girl'\u2014that populates Japanese fiction, and really the Japanese imagination, beginning in the 1920s onward.\" Throughout most of the film, Noriko wears Western clothing rather than a kimono, and outwardly behaves in up-to-date ways. However, Bordwell asserts that \"Noriko is more old-fashioned than her father, insisting that he could not get along without her and resenting the idea that a widower might remarry\u2026 she clings to an outmoded notion of propriety.\"\nThe other two important female characters in the film are also defined in terms of their relation to tradition. Noriko\u2019s Aunt Masa appears in scenes in which she is associated with traditional Japan, such as the tea ceremony in one of the ancient temples of Kamakura. Noriko\u2019s friend Aya, on the other hand, seems to reject tradition entirely. Aya had taken advantage of the new liberal divorce laws to end her recent marriage. Thus, she is presented as a new, Westernized phenomenon: the divorcee. She \"takes English tea with milk from teacups with handles, [and] also bakes shortcake (shaato keeki),\" a very un-Japanese type of food.\nLike Noriko, her father has an ambiguous relation with modernity. Shukichi is first seen in the film checking the correct spelling of the name of the German-American economist Friedrich List\u2014an important transitional figure during Japan\u2019s Meiji era. (List\u2019s theories helped stimulate the economic modernization of the country.) Prof. Somiya treats Aya, the divorcee, with unfailing courtesy and respect, implying a tolerant, \"modern\" attitude\u2014though one critic suspects that a man of Shukichi's class and generation in the real-life Japan of that period might have been considerably less tolerant.\nHowever, like Aunt Masa, Shukichi is also associated with the traditions of old Japan, such as the city of Kyoto with its ancient temples and Zen rock gardens, and the Noh play that he so clearly enjoys. Most importantly, he pressures Noriko to go through with the miai meeting with Satake, though he makes clear to her that she can reject her suitor without negative consequences.\nSorensen has summed up the ambiguous position of both father and daughter in relation to tradition as follows: \"Noriko and [Professor] Somiya interpolate between the two extremes, between shortcake and Nara-pickles, between ritually prepared green tea and tea with milk, between love marriage\/divorce and arranged marriage, between Tokyo and Nara. And this interpolation is what makes them complex characters, wonderfully human in all their internal inconsistencies, very Ozu-like and likable indeed.\"\n\nThe home\nLate Spring has been seen by some commentators as a transitional work in terms of the home as a recurring theme in Japanese cinema. Tadao Sato points out that Shochiku\u2019s directors of the 1920s and 1930s\u2014including Shimazu, Gosho, Mikio Naruse and Ozu himself\u2014\"presented the family in a tense confrontation with society.\" In A Brother and His Young Sister (Ani to sono imoto, 1939) by Shimazu, for example, \"the home is sanctified as a place of warmth and generosity, feelings that were rapidly vanishing in society.\" By the early 1940s, however, in such films as Ozu\u2019s There Was a Father, \"the family [was] completely subordinate to the [wartime] state\" and \"society is now above criticism.\" But when the military state collapsed as a result of Japan\u2019s defeat in the war, the idea of the home collapsed with it: \"Neither the nation nor the household could dictate morality any more.\"\nSato considers Late Spring to be \"the next major development in the home drama genre,\" because it \"initiated a series of Ozu films with the theme: there is no society, only the home. While family members had their own places of activity\u2014office, school, family business\u2014there was no tension between the outside world and the home. As a consequence, the home itself lost its source of moral strength.\" Yet despite the fact that these home dramas by Ozu \"tend to lack social relevance,\" they \"came to occupy the mainstream of the genre and can be considered perfect expressions of 'my home-ism,' whereby one\u2019s family is cherished to the exclusion of everything else.\"\n\nThe season and sexuality\nLate Spring is the first of several extant Ozu films with a \"seasonal\" title. (Later films with seasonal titles are Early Summer, Early Spring (Soshun, 1956), Late Autumn and The End of Summer (literally, \"Autumn for the Kohayagawa Family\")). The \"late spring\" of the title refers on the most obvious level to Noriko who, at 27, is in the \"late spring\" of her life, and approaching the age at which she would no longer be considered marriageable.\n\nHowever, there may be another meaning to Ozu's title derived from ancient Japanese culture. When Noriko and Shukichi attend the Noh play, the work performed is called Kakitsubata or \"The Water Iris.\" (The water iris in Japan is a plant which blooms, usually in marshland or other moist soil, in mid-to-late-spring.) In this play, a traveling monk arrives at a place called Yatsuhashi, famous for its water irises, when a woman appears. She alludes to a famous poem by the waka poet of the Heian period, Ariwara no Narihira, in which each of the five lines begins with one syllable that, spoken together, spell out the word for \"water iris\" (\"ka-ki-tsu-ba-ta\"). The monk stays the night at the humble hut of the woman, who then appears in an elaborate kimono and headdress and reveals herself to be the spirit of the water iris. She praises Narihira, dances and at dawn receives enlightenment from the Buddha and disappears.\nAs Norman Holland explains in an essay on the film, \"the iris is associated with late spring, the movie\u2019s title\", and the play contains a great deal of sexual and religious symbolism. The iris' leaves and flower are traditionally seen as representing the male and female genitalia, respectively. The play itself is traditionally seen, according to Holland, as \"a tribute to the union of man and woman leading to enlightenment.\"\nNoriko calmly accepts this sexual content when couched in the \"archaic\" form of Noh drama, but when she sees her father nod politely to the attractive widow, Mrs. Miwa, who is also in the audience, \"that strikes Noriko as outrageous and outraging. Had this woman and her father arranged to meet at this play about sexuality? Is this remarriage 'filthy' like [Onodera's] remarriage? She feels both angry and despairing. She is so mad at her father that, quite uncharacteristically, she angrily walks away from him after they leave the theater.\" Holland thus sees one of the film's main themes as \"the pushing of traditional and inhibited Noriko into marriage.\"\n\nMajor characters\nLate Spring has been particularly praised for its focus on character, having been cited as \"one of the most perfect, most complete, and most successful studies of character ever achieved in Japanese cinema.\" Ozu\u2019s complex approach to character can best be examined through the two protagonists of the film: Noriko Somiya and her father, Shukichi.\n\nNoriko Somiya\nNoriko, at 27, is an unmarried, unemployed young woman, completely dependent financially upon her father and living (at the film\u2019s beginning) quite contently with him. Her two most important traits, which are interrelated, are her unusually close and affectionate relationship with her father and her extreme reluctance to marry and leave home. Of the first trait, the relationship between father and daughter has been described as a \"transgenerational friendship,\" in which there is nevertheless no hint of anything incestuous or even inappropriate. However, it has been conceded that this may primarily be due to cultural differences between Japan and the West and that, were the story remade in the West, such a possible interpretation couldn\u2019t be evaded. The second trait, her strong aversion to the idea of marriage, has been seen, by some commentators, in terms of the Japanese concept of amae, which in this context signifies the strong emotional dependence of a child on its parent, which can persist into adulthood. Thus, the rupturing of the father-adult daughter relationship in Late Spring has been interpreted as Ozu\u2019s view of the inevitability\u2014and necessity\u2014of the termination of the amae relationship, although Ozu never glosses over the pain of such a rupture.\nThere has been considerable difference of opinion amongst commentators regarding the complicated personality of Noriko. She has been variously described as like a wife to her father, or as like a mother to him; as resembling a petulant child; or as being an enigma, particularly as to the issue of whether or not she freely chooses to marry. Even the common belief of film scholars that she is an upholder of conservative values, because of her opposition to her father\u2019s (feigned) remarriage plans, has been challenged. Robin Wood, writing about the three Norikos as one collective character, states that \"Noriko\" \"has managed to retain and develop the finest humane values which the modern capitalist world\u2026 tramples underfoot\u2014consideration, emotional generosity, the ability to care and empathize, and above all, awareness.\"\n\nProf. Shukichi Somiya\nNoriko\u2019s father, Shukichi, works as a college professor and is the sole breadwinner of the Somiya family. It has been suggested that the character represents a transition from the traditional image of the Japanese father to a very different one. Sato points out that the national prewar ideal of the father was that of the stern patriarch, who ruled his family lovingly, but with an iron hand. Ozu himself, however, in several prewar films, such as I Was Born, But\u2026 and Passing Fancy, had undercut, according to Sato, this image of the archetypal strong father by depicting parents who were downtrodden \"salarymen\" (sarariman, to use the Japanese term), or poor working-class laborers, who sometimes lost the respect of their rebellious children. Bordwell has noted that \"what is remarkable about Ozu's work of the 1920s and 1930s is how seldom the patriarchal norm is reestablished at the close [of each film].\"\nThe character of Prof. Somiya represents, according to this interpretation, a further evolution of the \u201cnon-patriarchal\u201d patriarch. Although Shukichi wields considerable moral influence over his daughter through their close relationship, that relationship is \"strikingly nonoppressive.\" One commentator refers to Shukichi and his friend, Professor Onodera, as men who are \"very much at peace, very much aware of themselves and their place in the world,\" and are markedly different from stereotypes of fierce Japanese males promulgated by American films during and after the World War.\nIt has been claimed that, after Noriko accepts Satake\u2019s marriage proposal, the film ceases to be about her, and that Prof. Somiya at that point becomes the true protagonist, with the focus of the film shifting to his increasing loneliness and grief. In this regard, a plot change that the filmmakers made from the original source material is significant. In the novel by Kazuo Hirotsu, the father\u2019s announcement to his daughter that he wishes to marry a widow is only initially a ruse; eventually, he actually does get married again. Ozu and his co-screenwriter, Noda, deliberately rejected this \"witty\" ending, in order to show Prof. Somiya as alone and inconsolable at the end.\n\nStyle\nOzu's unique style has been widely noted by critics and scholars. Some have considered it an anti-Hollywood style, as he eventually rejected many conventions of Hollywood filmmaking. Some aspects of the style of Late Spring\u2014which also apply to Ozu's late-period style in general, as the film is typical in almost all respects\u2014include Ozu's use of the camera, his use of actors, his idiosyncratic editing and his frequent employment of a distinctive type of shot that some commentators have called a \"pillow shot.\"\n\nOzu's use of the camera\nLow angle\nProbably the most frequently noted aspect of Ozu's camera technique is his consistent use of an extremely low camera position to shoot his subjects, a practice that Bordwell traces as far back as his films of the 1931\u20131932 period. An example of the low camera in Late Spring would be the scene in which Noriko visits her friend Aya in her home. Noriko is in a sitting position, while Aya is seated at a slightly higher elevation, so Aya is looking down towards her friend. However, \"the camera angle on both is low. Noriko sits looking up at the standing Aya, but the camera [in the reverse shot] looks up on Noriko's face, rejecting Aya's point of view. We are thus prevented from identifying with Aya and are forced into an inhuman point of view on Noriko.\"\nThere has been no critical consensus as to why Ozu consistently employed the low camera angle. Bordwell suggests that his motive was primarily visual, because the angle allowed him to create distinctive compositions within the frame and \"make every image sharp, stable and striking.\" The film historian and critic Donald Richie believed that one of the reasons he used this technique was as a way of \"exploiting the theatrical aspect of the Japanese dwelling.\" Another critic believes that the ultimate purpose of the low camera position was to allow the audience to assume \"a viewpoint of reverence\" towards the ordinary people in his films, such as Noriko and her father.\n\nStatic camera\nOzu was widely noted for a style characterized by a frequent avoidance of the kinds of camera movements\u2014such as panning shots, tracking shots or crane shots\u2014employed by most film directors. (As he himself would sometimes remark, \"I'm not a dynamic director like Akira Kurosawa.\") Bordwell notes that, of all the common technical practices that Ozu refused to emulate, he was \"most absolute\" in refusing to reframe (for example, by panning slightly) the moving human figure in order to keep it in view; this critic claims that there is not a single reframing in all of Ozu's films from 1930 on. In the late films (that is, those from Late Spring on), the director \"will use walls, screens, or doors to block off the sides of the frame so that people walk into a central depth,\" thus maintaining focus on the human figure without any motion of the camera.\nThe filmmaker would paradoxically retain his static compositions even when a character was shown walking or riding, by moving the camera with a dolly at the precise speed at which the actor or actors moved. He would drive his devoted cameraman, Yuharu Atsuta, to tears by insisting that actors and technicians count their steps precisely during a tracking shot so that the movements of actors and camera could be synchronized. Speaking of the bicycle ride to the beach early in the story, Pe\u00f1a notes: \"It\u2019s almost as if Noriko [on her bicycle] doesn\u2019t seem to be moving, or Hattori\u2019s not moving because his place within the frame remains constant\u2026 These are the sort of visual idiosyncrasies that make Ozu\u2019s style so interesting and so unique in a way, to give us movement and at the same time to undercut movement.\"\n\nOzu's use of actors\nVirtually all actors who worked with Ozu\u2014including Chishu Ryu, who collaborated with the director on almost all his films\u2014agree that he was an extremely demanding taskmaster. He would direct very simple actions by the performer \"to the centimeter.\" As opposed to those of both Mizoguchi and Kurosawa, Ozu's characters, according to Sato, are \"usually calm... they not only move at the same pace but also speak at the same measured rate.\" He insisted that his actors express emotions through action, even rote action, rather than by directly expressing their innermost feelings. Once, when the distinguished character actress Haruko Sugimura asked the director what her character was supposed to be feeling at a given moment, Ozu responded, \u201cYou are not supposed to feel, you are supposed to do.\u201d\nSugimura, who played Aunt Masa in Late Spring, vividly depicted Ozu\u2019s approach to directing actors in her description of the scene in which Noriko is about to leave her father\u2019s house for her wedding:\n\nOzu told me to come [back] in the room [after she, Hara and Ryu had exited] and circle around. So I did as I was told, but of course it wasn\u2019t good enough. After the third take, Ozu approved it\u2026 The reason [Aunt Masa] circles around the room once is that she\u2019s nostalgic for all the memories there and she also wants to make sure she\u2019s left nothing behind. He didn\u2019t show each of these things explicitly, but through my smoothly circling the room\u2014through how I moved, through the pacing and the blocking\u2014I think that\u2019s what he was trying to express. At the time, I didn\u2019t understand. I remember I did it rhythmically: I didn\u2019t walk and I didn\u2019t run; I just moved lightly and rhythmically. As I continued doing it, that\u2019s what it turned into, and Ozu okayed it. Come to think of it, it was that way of walking rhythmically that I think was good. I did it naturally, not deliberately. And of course it was Ozu who helped me do it.\n\nEditing\nAccording to Richie, the editing of an Ozu film was always subordinate to the script: that is, the rhythm of each scene was decided at the screenwriting stage, and the final editing of the film reflected this. This overriding tempo even determined how the sets were constructed. Sato quotes Tomo Shimogawara, who designed the sets for The End of Summer (though the description also clearly applies to other late-period Ozu films, including Late Spring): \"The size of the rooms was dictated by the time lapses between the actor's movements... Ozu would give me instructions on the exact length of the corridor. He explained that it was part and parcel of the tempo of his film, and this flow of tempo Ozu envisioned at the time the script was being written... Since Ozu never used wipes or dissolves, and for the sake of dramatic tempo as well, he would measure the number of seconds it took someone to walk upstairs and so the set had to be constructed accordingly.\" Sato says about this tempo that \"it is a creation in which time is beautifully apprehended in conformity with the physiology of daily occurrences.\"\nA striking fact about Ozu's late films (of which Late Spring is the first instance) is that transitions between scenes are accomplished exclusively through simple cuts. According to one commentator, the lost work, The Life of an Office Worker (Kaishain seikatsu, 1929), contained a dissolve, and several extant Ozu films of the 1930s (e.g., Tokyo Chorus and The Only Son) contain some fades. But by the time of Late Spring, these were completely eliminated, with only music cues to signal scene changes. (Ozu once spoke of the use of the dissolve as \"a form of cheating.\") This self-restraint by the filmmaker is now seen as very modern, because although fades, dissolves and even wipes were all part of common cinematic grammar worldwide at the time of Late Spring (and long afterwards), such devices are often considered somewhat \"old fashioned\" today, when straight cuts are the norm.\n\nPillow shots\nMany critics and scholars have commented upon the fact that frequently Ozu, instead of transitioning directly from the end of the opening credits to the first scene, or from one scene to another, interposes a shot or multiple shots\u2014as many as six\u2014of an object, or a group of objects, or a room, or a landscape, often (but not always) devoid of human figures. These units of film have been variously called \"curtain shots,\" \"intermediate spaces,\" \"empty shots\" or, most frequently, \"pillow shots\" (by analogy with the \"pillow words\" of classic Japanese verse).\nThe nature and function of these shots are disputed. Sato (citing the critic Keinosuke Nanbu) compares the shots to the use of the curtain in the Western theatre, that \"both present the environment of the next sequence and stimulate the viewer's anticipation.\" Richie claims that they are a means of presenting only what the characters themselves perceive or think about, to enable us to \"experience only what the characters are experiencing.\" Bordwell sees it as an expansion of the traditional transitional devices of the \"placing shot\" and the \"cutaway,\" using these to convey \"a loose notion of contiguity.\"\nSome examples of pillow shots in Late Spring\u2014as illustrated on the ozu-san.com website\u2014are: the three shots, immediately after the opening credits, of the Kita-Kamakura railway station, followed by a shot of Kenchoji temple, \"one of the five main [Zen] temples in Kamakura,\" in which the tea ceremony (the first scene) will take place; the shot immediately after the tea ceremony scene, showing a hillside with several nearly bare trees, which introduces a \"tree-motif\" associated with Noriko; a shot of a single leafy tree, appearing immediately after the Noh play scene and before the scene depicting Noriko and her father walking together, then separating; and a shot of one of the pagodas of Kyoto during the father and daughter's visit to that city late in the film.\n\nThe vase scene\nThe most discussed instance of a pillow shot in any Ozu film\u2014indeed, the most famous crux in the director's work\u2014is the scene that takes place at an inn in Kyoto, in which a vase figures prominently. During the father and daughter's last trip together, after a day sightseeing with Professor Onodera and his wife and daughter, they decide to go to sleep, and lie down on their separate futons on the floor of the inn. Noriko talks about what a nice person Onodera's new wife is, and how embarrassed she feels for having called Onodera's remarriage \"filthy.\" Shukichi assures her that she should not worry about it, because Onodera never took her words seriously. After Noriko confesses to her father that she found the thought of his own remarriage \"distasteful,\" she looks over to discover that he is already asleep, or seems to be. She looks up towards the ceiling and appears to smile.\nThere follows a six-second medium shot, in the semidarkness, of a vase on the floor in the same room, in front of a sh\u014dji screen through which the shadows of leafy branches can be seen. There is a cut back to Noriko, now looking sad and pensive, almost in tears. Then there is a ten-second shot of the same vase, identical to the earlier one, as the music on the soundtrack swells, cuing the next scene (which takes place at the Ry\u014dan-ji rock garden in Kyoto, the following day).\nAb\u00e9 Mark Nornes, in an essay entitled \"The Riddle of the Vase: Ozu Yasujir\u014d's Late Spring (1949),\" observes: \"Nothing in all of Ozu's films has sparked such conflicting explanations; everyone seems compelled to weigh in on this scene, invoking it as a key example in their arguments.\" Nornes speculates that the reason for this is the scene's \"emotional power and its unusual construction. The vase is clearly essential to the scene. The director not only shows it twice, but he lets both shots run for what would be an inordinate amount of time by the measure of most filmmakers.\" To one commentator, the vase represents \"stasis,\" and is thus \"an expression of something unified, permanent, transcendent.\" Another critic describes the vase and other Ozu \"still lifes\" as \"containers for our emotions.\" Yet another specifically disputes this interpretation, identifying the vase as \"a non-narrative element wedged into the action.\" A fourth scholar sees it as an instance of the filmmaker's deliberate use of \"false POV\" (point of view), since Noriko is never shown actually looking at the vase the audience sees. A fifth asserts that the vase is \"a classic feminine symbol.\" And yet another suggests several alternative interpretations, including the vase as \"a symbol of traditional Japanese culture,\" and as an indicator of Noriko's \"sense that... [her] relationship with her father has been changed.\"\nThe French philosopher-film theorist Gilles Deleuze, in his book L'image-temps. Cin\u00e9ma 2 (Cinema 2: The Time-Image, 1985), cited this particular scene as an example of what he referred to as the \"time image.\" Simply put, Deleuze sees the vase as an image of unchanging time, although objects within time (for example, Noriko) do change (e.g., from joy to sadness). \"The vase in Late Spring is interposed between [Noriko\u2019s] half smile and the beginning of her tears. There is becoming, change, passage. But the form of what changes does not itself change, does not pass on. This is time, time itself, \u2018a little bit of time in its pure state\u2019: a direct time-image, which gives what changes the unchanging form in which the change is produced\u2026 The still life is time, for everything that changes is in time, but time does not itself change\u2026 Ozu's still lifes endure, have a duration, over ten seconds of the vase: this duration of the vase is precisely the representation of that which endures, through the succession of changing states.\"\n\nInterpretations\nLike many celebrated works of cinema, Late Spring has inspired varied and often contradictory critical and scholarly interpretations. The two most common interpretations of Late Spring are: a) the view that the film represents one of a series of Ozu works that depict part of a universal and inevitable \"life cycle\", and is thus either duplicated or complemented by other Ozu works in the series; b) the view that the film, while similar in theme and even plot to other Ozu works, calls for a distinct critical approach, and that the work is in fact critical of marriage, or at least the particular marriage depicted in it.\n\nThe film as part of \"life cycle\" series\nOzu\u2019s films, both individually and collectively, are often seen as representing either a universal human life cycle or a portion of such a cycle. Ozu himself at least once spoke in such terms. \"I wanted in this picture [Early Summer] to show a life cycle. I wanted to depict mutability (rinne). I was not interested in action for its own sake. And I\u2019ve never worked so hard in my life.\"\nThose who hold this interpretation argue that this aspect of Ozu's work gives it its universality, and helps it transcend the specifically Japanese cultural context in which the films were created. Bock writes: \"The subject matter of the Ozu film is what faces all of us born of man and woman and going on to produce offspring of our own: the family\u2026 [The terms \"shomingeki\" or \"home drama\"] may be applied to Ozu\u2019s works and create an illusion of peculiar Japaneseness, but in fact behind the words are the problems we all face in a life cycle. They are the struggles of self-definition, of individual freedom, of disappointed expectations, of the impossibility of communication, of separation and loss brought about by the inevitable passages of marriage and death.\" Bock suggests that Ozu\u2019s wish to portray the life cycle affected his decisions on technical matters, such as the construction and use of the sets of his films. \"In employing the set like a curtainless stage Ozu allows for implication of transitoriness in the human condition. Allied with the other aspects of ritual in Ozu's techniques, it reinforces the feeling that we are watching a representative life cycle.\"\nAccording to Geist, Ozu wished to convey the concept of sabi, which she defines as \u201can awareness of the ephemeral\u201d: \"Much of what is ephemeral is also cyclical; thus, sabi includes an awareness of the cyclical, which is evinced both formally and thematically in Ozu\u2019s films. Often, they revolve around passages in the human life cycle, usually the marriage of a child or the death of a parent.\" She points out scenes that are carefully duplicated in Late Spring, evoking this cyclical theme: \"Noriko and her father\u2019s friend [Onodera] sit in a bar and talk about [Onodera\u2019s] remarriage, which Noriko condemns. In the film\u2019s penultimate sequence, the father and Noriko\u2019s friend Aya sit in a bar after Noriko\u2019s wedding. The scene is shot from exactly the same angles as was the first bar scene, and again the subject is remarriage.\"\n\nThe film as a critique of marriage\nA critical tendency opposing the \"life cycle\" theory emphasizes the differences in tone and intent between this film and other Ozu works that deal with similar themes, situations and characters. These critics are also highly skeptical of the widely held notion that Ozu regarded marriage (or at least the marriage in Late Spring) favorably. As critic Roger Ebert explains, \"Late Spring began a cycle of Ozu films about families... Did he make the same film again and again? Not at all. Late Spring and Early Summer are startlingly different. In the second, Noriko takes advantage of a conversational opening [about marriage] to overturn the entire plot... she accepts a man [as husband] she has known for a long time\u2014a widower with a child.\" In contrast, \"what happens [in Late Spring] at deeper levels is angry, passionate and\u2014wrong, we feel, because the father and the daughter are forced to do something neither one of them wants to do, and the result will be resentment and unhappiness.\" Ebert goes on, \"It is universally believed, just as in a Jane Austen novel, that a woman of a certain age is in want of a husband. Late Spring is a film about two people who desperately do not believe this, and about how they are undone by their tact, their concern for each other, and their need to make others comfortable by seeming to agree with them.\" The film \"tells a story that becomes sadder the more you think about it.\" Ebert included the film in his Great Movies list.\nLate Spring, in Wood's view, \"is about the sacrifice of Noriko\u2019s happiness in the interest of maintaining and continuing 'tradition,' [which sacrifice] takes the form of her marriage, and everyone in the film\u2014including the father and finally the defeated Noriko herself\u2014is complicit in it.\" He asserts that, in contradiction to the view of many critics, the film \"is not about a young woman trying nobly to sacrifice herself and her own happiness in order dutifully to serve her widowed father in his lonely old age,\" because her life as a single young woman is one she clearly prefers: \"With her father, Noriko has a freedom that she will never again regain.\" He points out that there is an unusual (for Ozu) degree of camera movement in the first half of the film, as opposed to the \"stasis\" of the second half, and that this corresponds to Noriko\u2019s freedom in the first half and the \"trap\" of her impending marriage in the second. Rather than perceiving the Noriko films as a cycle, Wood asserts that the trilogy is \"unified by its underlying progressive movement, a progression from the unqualified tragedy of Late Spring through the ambiguous 'happy ending' of Early Summer to the authentic and fully earned note of bleak and tentative hope at the end of Tokyo Story.\"\n\nReception and legacy\nReception and reputation of the film in Japan\nLate Spring was released in Japan on September 19, 1949. Basing his research upon files kept on the film by the Allied censorship, Sorensen notes: \"Generally speaking, [the film] was hailed with enthusiasm by Japanese critics when it opened at theaters.\" The publication Shin Yukan, in its review of September 20, emphasized the scenes that take place in Kyoto, describing them as embodying \"the calm Japanese atmosphere\" of the entire work. Both Shin Yukan and another publication, Tokyo Shinbun (in its review of September 26), considered the film beautiful and the former called it a \"masterpiece.\" There were, however, some cavils: the critic of Asahi Shinbun (September 23) complained that \"the tempo is not the feeling of the present period\" and the reviewer from Hochi Shinbun (September 21) warned that Ozu should choose more progressive themes, or else he would \"coagulate.\"\nIn 1950, the film became the fifth Ozu work overall, and the first of the postwar period, to top the Kinema Junpo poll, making it the Japanese critics' Best Film of 1949. In addition, that year the film won four prizes at the distinguished Mainichi Film Awards, sponsored by the newspaper Mainichi Shinbun: Best Film, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Actress (Setsuko Hara, who was also honored for two other films in which she appeared in 1949).\nIn a 2009 poll by Kinema Junpo of the best Japanese films of all time, nine Ozu films appeared. Late Spring was the second highest-rated film, tying for 36th place. (The highest-ranking of his films was Tokyo Story, which topped the list.)\nOzu's younger contemporary, Akira Kurosawa, in 1999 published a conversation with his daughter Kazuko in which he provided his unranked personal listing, in chronological order, of the top 100 films, both Japanese and non-Japanese, of all time. One of the works he selected was Late Spring, with the following comment: \"[Ozu's] characteristic camera work was imitated by many directors abroads [sic] as well, i.e., many people saw and see Mr. Ozu\u2019s movies, right? That\u2019s good. Indeed, one can learn pretty much from his movies. Young prospective movie makers in Japan should, I hope, see more of Ozu\u2019s work. Ah, it was really good times when Mr. Ozu, Mr. Naruse and\/or Mr. Mizoguchi were all making movies!\"\n\nReception and reputation of the film outside Japan\nNew Yorker Films released the film in North America on July 21, 1972. A newspaper clipping, dated August 6, 1972, indicates that, of the New York-based critics of the time, six (Stuart Byron of The Village Voice, Charles Michener of Newsweek, Vincent Canby of The New York Times, Archer Winsten of The New York Post, Judith Crist of The Today Show and Stanley Kauffmann of The New Republic) gave the work a favorable review, and one critic (John Simon of New York) gave it a \"mixed\" review.\nCanby observed that \"the difficulty with Ozu is not in appreciating his films... [but] in describing an Ozu work in a way that doesn't diminish it, that doesn't reduce it to an inventory of his austere techniques, and that accurately reflects the unsentimental humanism of this discipline.\" He called the characters played by Ryu and Hara \"immensely affecting\u2014gentle, loving, amused, thinking and feeling beings,\" and praised the filmmaker for his \"profound respect for [the characters'] privacy, for the mystery of their emotions. Because of this\u2014not in spite of this\u2014his films, of which Late Spring is one of the finest, are so moving.\"\nStuart Byron of The Village Voice called Late Spring \"Ozu\u2019s greatest achievement and, thus, one of the ten best films of all time.\"\nIn Variety, reviewer Robert B. Frederick (under the pseudonym \"Robe\") also had high praise for the work. \"Although made in 1949,\" he wrote, \"this infrequently-seen example of the cinematic mastery of the late Yasujir\u014d Ozu... compares more than favorably with any major Japanese film... A heartwarming and very worthy cinematic effort.\"\nModern genre critics equally reviewed the film positively, giving the film an aggregate score of 100% on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes from 24 reviews, with an average score of 9.00\/10. Kurosawa biographer Stuart Galbraith IV, reviewing the Criterion Collection DVD, called the work \"archetypal postwar Ozu\" and \"a masterful distillation of themes its director would return to again and again... There are better Ozu films, but Late Spring impressively boils the director's concerns down to their most basic elements.\" Norman Holland concludes that \"Ozu has created\u2014in the best Japanese manner\u2014a film explicitly beautiful but rich in ambiguity and the unexpressed.\" Dennis Schwartz calls it \"a beautiful drama,\" in which \"there's nothing artificial, manipulative or sentimental.\" The Village Voice ranked the film at number 112 in its Top 250 \"Best Films of the Century\" list in 1999, based on a poll of critics.\nLeonard Maltin awarded the film four out of four stars, calling it \"A transcendent and profoundly moving work rivaling Tokyo Story as the director's masterpiece.\"\nOn August 1, 2012, the British Film Institute (BFI) published its decennial Sight & Sound \"Greatest Films of All Time\" poll, one of the most widely respected such polls among fans and scholars A total of 846 \"critics, programmers, academics, distributors, writers and other cinephiles\" submitted Top Ten lists for the poll. In that listing, Late Spring appeared in 15th place among all films from the dawn of cinema. It was the second-highest ranking Japanese-language film on the list. (Ozu's own Tokyo Story appeared in third place. Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai was the third-highest ranking Japanese-language film on the list, tied at 17th place.) In the previous BFI poll (2002), Late Spring did not appear either on the critics' or the directors' \"Top Ten\" lists. The film ranked 53rd in BBC's 2018 list of The 100 greatest foreign language films voted by 209\nfilm critics from 43 countries around the world.\n\nFilms inspired by Late Spring\nOnly one remake of Late Spring has so far been filmed: a television movie, produced to celebrate Ozu's centennial, entitled A Daughter's Marriage (Musume no kekkon), directed by the distinguished filmmaker Kon Ichikawa and produced by the Japanese pay television channel WOWOW. It was broadcast on December 14, 2003, two days after the 100th anniversary of Ozu's birth (and 40th anniversary of his death). Ichikawa, a younger contemporary of Ozu's, was 88 years old at the time of the broadcast. The film recreated various idiosyncrasies of the late director's style. For example, Ichikawa included many shots with vividly red objects, in imitation of Ozu's well-known fondness for red in his own color films (although Late Spring was not itself shot in color).\nIn addition, a number of works wholly or partly inspired by the original 1949 film have been released over the years. These works can be divided into three types: variations (directed by Ozu himself), homages (by directors other than Ozu), and at least one parody.\nThe most obvious variation of Late Spring in Ozu's own work is Late Autumn, which deals again with a daughter who reacts negatively to the (false) rumor of the remarriage of a parent\u2014this time a mother (Setsuko Hara) rather than a father\u2014and ultimately gets married herself. One scholar refers to this film as \"a version of Late Spring.\", while another describes it as \"a revision of Late Spring, with Akiko (played by Hara, the daughter in the earlier film) taking the father's role.\" Other Ozu films also contain plot elements first established by the 1949 film, though somewhat altered. For example, the 1958 film Equinox Flower (Higanbana), the director's first ever in color, focuses on a marriageable daughter, though as one scholar points out, the plot is a \"reversal\" of Late Spring in that the father at first opposes his daughter's marriage.\nThe French director Claire Denis has acknowledged that her critically acclaimed 2008 film 35 Shots of Rum (35 Rhums) is a homage to Ozu. \"This film is also a sort of... not copy, but it has stolen a lot to [sic] a famous Ozu film called Late Spring\u2026 [Ozu] was trying to show through few characters\u2026 the relation between human beings.\"\nBecause of perceived similarities, in subject matter and in his contemplative approach, to the Japanese master, Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsien has been called \"an artistic heir to Ozu.\" In 2003, to celebrate Ozu's centennial, Shochiku, the studio where Ozu worked throughout his career, commissioned Hou to make a film in tribute. The resulting work, Caf\u00e9 Lumi\u00e8re (K\u014dh\u012b Jik\u014d, 2003), has been called, \"in its way, a version of the Late Spring story, updated to the early 21st Century.\" However, unlike the virginal Noriko, the heroine of the Hou film, Yoko, \"lives on her own, is independent of her family, and has no intention of marrying just because she's pregnant.\"\nAn offbeat Japanese variant, the 2003 film A Lonely Cow Weeps at Dawn (Chikan gifu: Musuko no yome to..., also known as A Cow at Daybreak, Cowshed of Immorality, or Father in Law), belongs to the Japanese pinku (pink film) genre of softcore films. The drama tells the story of a senile farmer (named Shukichi) who enjoys a bizarrely sexualized relationship with his daughter-in-law (named Noriko). The director, Daisuke Goto, claims that the film was strongly influenced by, among other works, Late Spring.\nPerhaps the strangest tribute of all is yet another \"pink\" film, Abnormal Family, also known as Spring Bride or My Brother's Wife (Hentai kazoku: Aniki no yomesan, 1983), director Masayuki Suo's first film. It has been called \"perhaps the only film that ever replicated Ozu\u2019s style down to the most minute detail. The story, style, characters, and settings constantly invoke Ozu\u2019s iconography, and especially Late Spring.\" As in Ozu's classic, the narrative has a wedding which is never shown on screen and Suo consistently imitates the older master's \"much posited predilection for carefully composed static shots from a low camera angle... affectionately poking fun at the restrained and easy going 'life goes on' philosophy of its model.\" Nornes indicates that this film is significant because it points up the fact that Ozu's films are enjoyed in different ways by two different audiences: as emotion-laden family stories by general audiences, and as exercises in cinematic style by sophisticated film fans.\n\nHome media\nLate Spring was released on VHS in an English-subtitled version by New Yorker Video in November 1994.\nIn 2003, Shochiku marked the centennial of Ozu's birth by releasing a Region 2 DVD of the film in Japan (with no English subtitles). In the same year, the Hong Kong-based distributor Panorama released a Region 0 (worldwide) DVD of the film, in NTSC format, but with English and Chinese subtitles.\nIn 2004, Bo Ying, a Chinese distributor, released a Region 0 DVD of Late Spring in NTSC format with English, Chinese and Japanese subtitles. In 2005, Tartan released a Region 0, English-subtitled DVD of the film, in PAL format, as Volume One of its Triple Digipak series of Ozu's Noriko Trilogy.\nIn 2006, The Criterion Collection released a two-disc set with a restored high-definition digital transfer and new subtitle translations. It also includes Tokyo-Ga, an Ozu tribute by director Wim Wenders; an audio commentary by Richard Pe\u00f1a; and essays by Michael Atkinson and Donald Richie. In 2009, the Australian distributor Madman Entertainment released an English-subtitled Region 4 DVD of the film in PAL format.\nIn June 2010, BFI released the film on Region B-locked Blu-ray. The release includes a 24-page illustrated booklet as well as Ozu's earlier film The Only Son, also in HD, and a DVD copy of both films (in Region 2 and PAL). In April 2012, Criterion released a Blu-ray version of the film. This release contains the same supplements as Criterion's DVD version.\n\nSee also\nList of films in the public domain in the United States\nCinema of Japan\nCinema of Asia\nKogo Noda\nList of film director and cinematographer collaborations\n\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\nExternal links\n\nLate Spring at IMDb\nLate Spring at AllMovie\nLate Spring at Rotten Tomatoes\nTributes to Yasujiro Ozu, edited by Russ McClay (with lecture on Paul Schrader\u2019s 1972 book Transcendental Style in Film: Ozu, Bresson, Dreyer, spoken in Spanish), using various clips from Late Spring on YouTube\nBanshun at the Japanese Movie Database (in Japanese)\nLate Spring: Home with Ozu an essay by Michael Atkinson at the Criterion Collection","109":"The following is a list of works, both in film and other media, for which the Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa made some documented creative contribution.

However, to supplement his income, he also wrote scripts for other Japanese directors throughout the 1940s, and even through the 1950s and part of the 1960s, long after he had become world-famous. He also worked on the scripts for two Hollywood productions he was slated to direct, but which, for complex reasons, were completed by and credited to other directors (although he did shoot some scenes for Tora tora tora!, the footage from which has apparently not survived). Finally, near the end of his life, he completed scripts he intended to direct but did not live to make, which were then filmed by others. A table of all these screenplays is given below; all titles are Japanese productions unless otherwise noted.\n\nIn addition, Kurosawa wrote the following unproduced scripts, composed during the pre-war period in the 1930s and also the wartime period in the 1940s, either when he was still an assistant director or had just graduated to full director. Some of these won prizes in screenwriting contests, establishing his reputation as a promising talent even though they were never filmed.\n\nDeruma-dera no doitsujin \u2013 A German at Daruma Temple\nShizukanari \u2013  All Is Quiet\nYuki \u2013 Snow\nMori no senichia \u2013 A Thousand and One Nights in the Forest\nJajauma monogatari \u2013 The Story of a Bad Horse\nDokkoi kono yari \u2013 The Lifted Spear\nSan Paguita no hana \u2013 The San Pajuito Flower\nUtsukishiki koyomi \u2013 Beautiful Calendar\nDaisan hatoba \u2013 The Third Harbor\n\nAs assistant director\nAs editor\nKurosawa edited all his own films, though he only occasionally took screen credit for it.

The central character of the drama is a fish merchant who, during the war, greatly admires Prime Minister T\u014dj\u014d. In emulation of his patriarchal hero, the merchant plays the tyrant at home, but when the war ends, his angry family members air their long pent-up grievances against him. Kurosawa called it \"a comic treatment of... Japanese who all begin talking at once\", because \"we who had been able to express nothing of what we were thinking up to that time [the end of the war] all began talking at once.\"\nYoidore Tenshi (Drunken Angel) \u2013 During the Toho strike of 1948, when Kurosawa could not work, he wrote and directed a stage adaptation of his acclaimed 1948 film (see above), with Takashi Shimura and Toshiro Mifune playing the same roles they played in the movie. The production ran for brief periods in a number of Japanese cities, apparently with great success.\nPredlozhenia (A Marriage Proposal) by Anton Chekhov \u2013 Also during the Toho strike, Kurosawa directed a production of this popular early Chekhov farce. Neither the actors who appeared in the production nor its reception by the public is known.\n\nTelevision work\nA documentary about horses called Song of the Horse (or Uma no Uta), directed by Kurosawa, was broadcast in Japan, supposedly on August 31, 1970 (Kurosawa otherwise totally avoided working in television). Very little is known about the film, and its release date is even in question. For instance, though the film is often said to have aired in August 1970, it is thought that the film features footage of events that did not take place until the summer of 1971. It was considered a lost film for decades and was not available on home video in any form. At some point in the 2010s, the film was rediscovered. It was remastered and released on DVD by the American independent company SamuraiDVD in 2017, complete with English subtitles.\n\nBooks\nPrior to writing the screenplay to his film, Stray Dog (Nora Inu, 1949), Kurosawa created, in about six weeks, a novel based on the same story (presumably also called Stray Dog), which he never published. It was written in the style of one of his favorite writers, the French crime author Georges Simenon. Writing it was supposed to help him compose the script as quickly as possible, but he found that writing the screenplay took even longer than usual because of the complex differences between literature and film.\nIn 1980, inspired by the memoir of one of his heroes, Jean Renoir, he began to publish in serial form his autobiography, entitled Gama no abura (An Oily Toad). The book deals with the period from the director's birth to his winning the Golden Lion for Rashomon from the Venice Film Festival in 1951; the period from 1951 through 1980 is not covered. The title of the book is a reference to a legend according to which, if one places a deformed toad in a box full of mirrors, it will become so afraid of its own reflection that it will begin to sweat, and this sweat allegedly had medicinal properties. Kurosawa compared himself to the toad, nervous about having to contemplate, through the process of writing his life story, his own multiple \"reflections.\" It was published as a book in Japan in 1981, and in English translation the following year under the title Something Like an Autobiography. The book's appearance coincided with the revival of interest in Kurosawa's work following the international release of Kagemusha. (ISBN 0394509382)\nIn 1999, his book, Yume wa tensai de aru (A Dream Is a Genius) was published posthumously. It has not been translated into English, except for Chapter 3. This chapter consists of a selection of 100 of the director's favorite films, listed in chronological order, with detailed commentaries on each film, all given at the request of Kurosawa's daughter, Kazuko. (Since he deliberately limits himself to one film per director, however, the list emerges as more of a \"favorite directors\" list than a \"greatest films\" list.) This chapter, but not the remainder of the book, can be found in English on the Internet. (ISBN 4163555706)\nComplete Drawings (with text in Japanese) was published by Shogakukan in 1999.

She graduated from Waseda University in 1987 and worked in an office for several years, then quit her job to try writing a novel after reading Ken'ichi Sakemi's 1991 novel K\u014dky\u016b sh\u014dsetsu (\u5f8c\u5bae\u5c0f\u8aaa).\n\nCareer\nOnda made her literary debut in 1992 with the novel Rokubanme no Sayoko (\u516d\u756a\u76ee\u306e\u5c0f\u591c\u5b50, The Sixth Sayoko), which was adapted into the 2000 NHK show Rokubanme no Sayoko (\u516d\u756a\u76ee\u306e\u5c0f\u591c\u5b50, Sayoko is Back) starring Anne Suzuki and Chiaki Kuriyama. More novels and adaptations followed, including the 1999 novel Mokuy\u014d kumikyoku (\u6728\u66dc\u7d44\u66f2), which was adapted into a 2002 film, and the 2000 novel Neb\u0101rando (\u30cd\u30d0\u30fc\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9, Neverland), which was adapted into a 2001 TBS television series starring Tsubasa Imai.\nIn 2005 Onda won the 26th Yoshikawa Eiji Prize for New Writers and the 2nd Japan Booksellers' Award Grand Prize for her novel Yoru no pikunikku (\u591c\u306e\u30d4\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af, Nighttime Picnic), a story about two half-siblings participating in their school's annual hike. Yoru no pikunikku was adapted into a 2006 film of the same name, directed by Masahiko Nagasawa and starring Mikako Tabe. After being previously nominated for a 58th Mystery Writers of Japan Award for her book Q&A in 2005, Onda won the 59th Mystery Writers of Japan Award for Best Novel in 2006 for her murder mystery Yujinia (\u30e6\u30fc\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2, Eugenia). The next year she won the 20th Yamamoto Sh\u016bgor\u014d Prize for her book Nakaniwa no dekigoto (\u4e2d\u5ead\u306e\u51fa\u6765\u4e8b, The Incident in the Courtyard), a complex story about a playwright writing a play about a playwright who is murdered while writing a play. Onda's 2011 novel Yumechigai (\u5922\u9055, Mistaken Dreams) was adapted into the 2012 television drama Akumu-chan, starring Keiko Kitagawa and shown on Nippon TV. An Akumu-chan film sequel, also starring Keiko Kitagawa, premiered in 2014. \nIn 2017, after having been nominated six different times for the Naoki Prize, Onda won the 156th Naoki Prize for her 2016 book Mitsubachi to enrai (\u871c\u8702\u3068\u9060\u96f7, Honey Bee and Distant Thunder), a story about an international piano competition. Mitsubachi to enrai also won the Japan Booksellers Award Grand Prize in 2017. After winning the Naoki Award Onda visited her hometown of Sendai and received a special award from Mayor Emiko Okuyama.\n\nRecognition\n2005 26th Yoshikawa Eiji Prize for New Writers\n2005 2nd Japan Booksellers' Award Grand Prize\n2006 59th Mystery Writers of Japan Award\n2007 20th Yamamoto Sh\u016bgor\u014d Prize\n2017 156th Naoki Prize (2016\u4e0b)\n2017 14th Japan Booksellers' Award Grand Prize\n\nFilm and other adaptations\nFilm\nMokuy\u014d kumikyoku (\u6728\u66dc\u7d44\u66f2), 2002\nYoru no pikunikku (\u591c\u306e\u30d4\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af, Nighttime Picnic), 2006\n Akumu-chan (\u60aa\u5922\u3061\u3083\u3093 The\u5922ovie), 2014\nListen to the Universe (Mitsubachi to enrai), 2019\n\nTelevision\nRokubanme no Sayoko (\u516d\u756a\u76ee\u306e\u5c0f\u591c\u5b50, The Sixth Sayoko)\nNeverland (\u30cd\u30d0\u30fc\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9), TBS, 2001\nAkumu-chan (\u60aa\u5922\u3061\u3083\u3093), Nippon TV, 2012\n\nBibliography\nSelected works in Japanese\nRokubanme no Sayoko (\u516d\u756a\u76ee\u306e\u5c0f\u591c\u5b50, Sixth Child), Shinchosha, 1992, ISBN 9784101234113\nMokuy\u014d kumikyoku (\u6728\u66dc\u7d44\u66f2), Tokuma Shoten, 1999, ISBN 9784198610937\nNeb\u0101rando (\u30cd\u30d0\u30fc\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9, Neverland), Shueisha, 2000, ISBN 9784087744637\nQ&A, Gentosha, 2004, ISBN 9784344006232\nYoru no pikunikku (\u591c\u306e\u30d4\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af, Nighttime Picnic), Shinchosha, 2004, ISBN 9784103971054\nYujinia (\u30e6\u30fc\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2, Eugenia), Kadokawa Shoten, 2005, ISBN 9784048735735\nNakaniwa no dekigoto (\u4e2d\u5ead\u306e\u51fa\u6765\u4e8b, The Incident in the Courtyard), Shinchosha, 2006, ISBN 9784103971078\nKomorebi ni Oyogu Sakana (\u6728\u6d29\u308c\u65e5\u306b\u6cf3\u3050\u9b5a, Fish Swimming in Dappled Sunlight), Chuokoron-Shinsha, 2007, ISBN 9784120038518\nYumechigai (\u5922\u9055), Kadokawa Shoten, 2011, ISBN 9784041100608\nMitsubachi to enrai (\u871c\u8702\u3068\u9060\u96f7, Honey Bee and Distant Thunder), Gentosha, 2016, ISBN 9784344030039\n\nSelected works in English\n\"The Big Drawer\", translated by Nora Stevens Heath, Speculative Japan 2, 2011\n\"The Warning\", translated by Mikhail S.

He is regarded as one of the greatest and most influential authors of all time. He received nominations for the Nobel Prize in Literature every year from 1902 to 1906 and for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1901, 1902, and 1909.\nBorn into an aristocratic family, Tolstoy's notable works include the novels War and Peace (1869) and Anna Karenina (1878), often cited as pinnacles of realist fiction, and two of the greatest books of all time. He first achieved literary acclaim in his twenties with his semi-autobiographical trilogy, Childhood, Boyhood, and Youth (1852\u20131856), and Sevastopol Sketches (1855), based upon his experiences in the Crimean War. His fiction includes dozens of short stories such as \"After the Ball\" (1911), and several novellas such as The Death of Ivan Ilyich (1886), Family Happiness (1859) and Hadji Murad (1912). He also wrote plays and essays concerning philosophical, moral and religious themes.\nIn the 1870s, Tolstoy experienced a profound moral crisis, followed by what he regarded as an equally profound spiritual awakening, as outlined in his non-fiction work Confession (1882). His literal interpretation of the ethical teachings of Jesus, centering on the Sermon on the Mount, caused him to become a fervent Christian anarchist and pacifist. His ideas on nonviolent resistance, expressed in such works as The Kingdom of God Is Within You (1894), had a profound impact on such pivotal 20th-century figures as Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., James Bevel, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. He also became a dedicated advocate of Georgism, the economic philosophy of Henry George, which he incorporated into his writing, particularly in his novel Resurrection (1899).\nTolstoy received praise from countless authors and critics, both during his lifetime and after. Virginia Woolf called Tolstoy \"the greatest of all novelists\", and Gary Saul Morson referred to War and Peace as the greatest of all novels. Tolstoy never having won a Nobel Prize was a major Nobel Prize controversy, and remains one.\n\nOrigins\nThe Tolstoys were a well-known family of old Russian nobility who traced their ancestry to a mythical nobleman named Indris described by Pyotr Tolstoy as arriving \"from Nemec, from the lands of Caesar\" to Chernigov in 1353 along with his two sons Litvinos (or Litvonis) and Zimonten (or Zigmont) and a druzhina of 3000 people. Indris was then converted to Eastern Orthodoxy, under the name of Leonty, and his sons as Konstantin and Feodor. Konstantin's grandson Andrei Kharitonovich was nicknamed Tolstiy (translated as fat) by Vasily II of Moscow after he moved from Chernigov to Moscow.\nBecause of the pagan names and the fact that Chernigov at the time was ruled by Demetrius I Starshy, some researchers concluded that they were Lithuanians who arrived from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. At the same time, no mention of Indris was ever found in the 14th-to-16th-century documents, while the Chernigov Chronicles used by Pyotr Tolstoy as a reference were lost. The first documented members of the Tolstoy family also lived during the 17th century, thus Pyotr Tolstoy himself is generally considered the founder of the noble house, being granted the title of count by Peter the Great.\n\nLife and career\nTolstoy was born at Yasnaya Polyana, a family estate 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) southwest of Tula, and 200 kilometres (120 mi) south of Moscow. He was the fourth of five children of Count Nikolai Ilyich Tolstoy (1794\u20131837), a veteran of the Patriotic War of 1812, and Princess Mariya Tolstaya (n\u00e9e Volkonskaya; 1790\u20131830). His mother died when he was two and his father when he was nine. Tolstoy and his siblings were brought up by relatives. In 1844, he began studying law and oriental languages at Kazan University, where teachers described him as \"both unable and unwilling to learn\". Tolstoy left the university in the middle of his studies, returned to Yasnaya Polyana and then spent much time in Moscow, Tula and Saint Petersburg, leading a lax and leisurely lifestyle. He began writing during this period, including his first novel Childhood, a fictitious account of his own youth, which was published in 1852. In 1851, after running up heavy gambling debts, he went with his older brother to the Caucasus and joined the army. Tolstoy served as a young artillery officer during the Crimean War and was in Sevastopol during the 11-month-long siege of Sevastopol in 1854\u201355, including the Battle of the Chernaya. During the war he was recognised for his courage and promoted to lieutenant. He was appalled by the number of deaths involved in warfare, and left the army after the end of the Crimean War.\nHis experience in the army, and two trips around Europe in 1857 and 1860\u201361 converted Tolstoy from a dissolute and privileged society author to a non-violent and spiritual anarchist. Others who followed the same path were Alexander Herzen, Mikhail Bakunin and Peter Kropotkin. During his 1857 visit, Tolstoy witnessed a public execution in Paris, a traumatic experience that marked the rest of his life. In a letter to his friend Vasily Botkin, Tolstoy wrote: \"The truth is that the State is a conspiracy designed not only to exploit, but above all to corrupt its citizens ... Henceforth, I shall never serve any government anywhere.\" Tolstoy's concept of non-violence or ahimsa was bolstered when he read a German version of the Tirukkural. He later instilled the concept in Mahatma Gandhi through his \"A Letter to a Hindu\" when young Gandhi corresponded with him seeking his advice.\nHis European trip in 1860\u201361 shaped both his political and literary development when he met Victor Hugo. Tolstoy read Hugo's newly finished Les Mis\u00e9rables. The similar evocation of battle scenes in Hugo's novel and Tolstoy's War and Peace indicates this influence. Tolstoy's political philosophy was also influenced by a March 1861 visit to French anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, then living in exile under an assumed name in Brussels. Tolstoy reviewed Proudhon's forthcoming publication, La Guerre et la Paix (\"War and Peace\" in French), and later used the title for his masterpiece. The two men also discussed education, as Tolstoy wrote in his educational notebooks: \"If I recount this conversation with Proudhon, it is to show that, in my personal experience, he was the only man who understood the significance of education and of the printing press in our time.\"\nFired by enthusiasm, Tolstoy returned to Yasnaya Polyana and founded 13 schools for the children of Russia's peasants, who had just been emancipated from serfdom in 1861. Tolstoy described the schools' principles in his 1862 essay \"The School at Yasnaya Polyana\". His educational experiments were short-lived, partly due to harassment by the Tsarist secret police. However, as a direct forerunner to A.S. Neill's Summerhill School, the school at Yasnaya Polyana can justifiably be claimed the first example of a coherent theory of democratic education.\n\nPersonal life\nThe death of his brother Nikolay in 1860 had an impact on Tolstoy, and led him to a desire to marry. On 23 September 1862, Tolstoy married Sophia Andreevna Behrs, who was sixteen years his junior and the daughter of a court physician. She was called Sonya, the Russian diminutive of Sofia, by her family and friends. They had 13 children, eight of whom survived childhood:\n\nCount Sergei Lvovich Tolstoy (1863\u20131947), composer and ethnomusicologist\nCountess Tatyana Lvovna Tolstaya (1864\u20131950), wife of Mikhail Sergeevich Sukhotin\nCount Ilya Lvovich Tolstoy (1866\u20131933), writer\nCount Lev Lvovich Tolstoy (1869\u20131945), writer and sculptor\nCountess Maria Lvovna Tolstaya (1871\u20131906), wife of Nikolai Leonidovich Obolensky\nCount Peter Lvovich Tolstoy (1872\u20131873), died in infancy\nCount Nikolai Lvovich Tolstoy (1874\u20131875), died in infancy\nCountess Varvara Lvovna Tolstaya (1875\u20131875), died in infancy\nCount Andrei Lvovich Tolstoy (1877\u20131916), served in the Russo-Japanese War\nCount Michael Lvovich Tolstoy (1879\u20131944)\nCount Alexei Lvovich Tolstoy (1881\u20131886)\nCountess Alexandra Lvovna Tolstaya (1884\u20131979)\nCount Ivan Lvovich Tolstoy (1888\u20131895)\nThe marriage was marked from the outset by sexual passion and emotional insensitivity when Tolstoy, on the eve of their marriage, gave her his diaries detailing his extensive sexual past and the fact that one of the serfs on his estate had borne him a son. Even so, their early married life was happy and allowed Tolstoy much freedom and the support system to compose War and Peace and Anna Karenina with Sonya acting as his secretary, editor, and financial manager. Sonya was copying and hand-writing his epic works time after time. Tolstoy would continue editing War and Peace and had to have clean final drafts to be delivered to the publisher.\nHowever, their later life together has been described by A.N. Wilson as one of the unhappiest in literary history. Tolstoy's relationship with his wife deteriorated as his beliefs became increasingly radical. This saw him seeking to reject his inherited and earned wealth, including the renunciation of the copyrights on his earlier works.\nWhen he was finishing up the last installments of Anna Karenina Tolstoy was in an anguished state of mind and he began putting away guns and ropes out of fear that he would kill himself.\nSome members of the Tolstoy family left Russia in the aftermath of the 1905 Russian Revolution, or after the establishment of the Soviet Union following the 1917 October Revolution, and many of Leo Tolstoy's relatives and descendants today live in Sweden, Germany, the United Kingdom, France and the United States. Tolstoy's son, Count Lev Lvovich Tolstoy, settled in Sweden and married a Swedish woman, and their descendants with family names including Tolstoy, Paus and Ceder still live in Sweden. The Paus branch of the family is also closely related to Henrik Ibsen. Leo Tolstoy's last surviving grandchild, Countess Tatiana Tolstoy-Paus, died in 2007 at Herresta manor in Sweden, which is owned by Tolstoy's descendants. Swedish writer Daria Paus and jazz singer Viktoria Tolstoy are among Leo Tolstoy's Swedish descendants.\nOne of his great-great-grandsons, Vladimir Tolstoy (born 1962), has been a director of the Yasnaya Polyana museum since 1994 and an adviser to the President of Russia on cultural affairs since 2012. Ilya Tolstoy's great-grandson, Pyotr Tolstoy, is a well-known Russian journalist and TV presenter as well as a State Duma deputy since 2016. His cousin Fyokla Tolstaya (born Anna Tolstaya in 1971), daughter of the acclaimed Soviet Slavist Nikita Tolstoy (ru) (1923\u20131996), is also a Russian journalist, TV and radio host.\n\nNovels and fictional works\nTolstoy is considered one of the giants of Russian literature; his works include the novels War and Peace and Anna Karenina and novellas such as Hadji Murad and The Death of Ivan Ilyich.\nTolstoy's earliest works, the autobiographical novels Childhood, Boyhood, and Youth (1852\u20131856), tell of a rich landowner's son and his slow realization of the chasm between himself and his peasants. Though he later rejected them as sentimental, a great deal of Tolstoy's own life is revealed. They retain their relevance as accounts of the universal story of growing up.\nTolstoy served as a second lieutenant in an artillery regiment during the Crimean War, recounted in his Sevastopol Sketches. His experiences in battle helped stir his subsequent pacifism and gave him material for realistic depiction of the horrors of war in his later work.\nHis fiction consistently attempts to convey realistically the Russian society in which he lived. The Cossacks (1863) describes the Cossack life and people through a story of a Russian aristocrat in love with a Cossack girl. Anna Karenina (1877) tells parallel stories of an adulterous woman trapped by the conventions and falsities of society and of a philosophical landowner (much like Tolstoy), who works alongside the peasants in the fields and seeks to reform their lives. Tolstoy not only drew from his own life experiences but also created characters in his own image, such as Pierre Bezukhov and Prince Andrei in War and Peace, Levin in Anna Karenina and to some extent, Prince Nekhlyudov in Resurrection. Richard Pevear, who translated many of Tolstoy's works, said of Tolstoy's signature style, \"His works are full of provocation and irony, and written with broad and elaborately developed rhetorical devices.\"\n\nWar and Peace is generally thought to be one of the greatest novels ever written, remarkable for its dramatic breadth and unity. Its vast canvas includes 580 characters, many historical with others fictional. The story moves from family life to the headquarters of Napoleon, from the court of Alexander I of Russia to the battlefields of Austerlitz and Borodino. Tolstoy's original idea for the novel was to investigate the causes of the Decembrist revolt, to which it refers only in the last chapters, from which can be deduced that Andrei Bolkonsky's son will become one of the Decembrists. The novel explores Tolstoy's theory of history, and in particular the insignificance of individuals such as Napoleon and Alexander. Somewhat surprisingly, Tolstoy did not consider War and Peace to be a novel (nor did he consider many of the great Russian fictions written at that time to be novels). This view becomes less surprising if one considers that Tolstoy was a novelist of the realist school who considered the novel to be a framework for the examination of social and political issues in nineteenth-century life. War and Peace (which is to Tolstoy really an epic in prose) therefore did not qualify. Tolstoy thought that Anna Karenina was his first true novel.\nAfter Anna Karenina, Tolstoy concentrated on Christian themes, and his later novels such as The Death of Ivan Ilyich (1886) and What Is to Be Done? develop a radical anarcho-pacifist Christian philosophy which led to his excommunication from the Russian Orthodox Church in 1901. After his religious conversion, Tolstoy came to reject most modern Western culture, including his novels War and Peace and Anna Karenina, as elitist \"counterfeit art\" with different aims from the Christian art of universal brotherly love he sought to express.\nIn his novel Resurrection, Tolstoy attempts to expose the injustice of man-made laws and the hypocrisy of an institutionalized church. Tolstoy also explores and explains the economic philosophy of Georgism, of which he had become a very strong advocate towards the end of his life.\nTolstoy also tried writing poetry, with several soldier songs written during his military service, and fairy tales in verse such as Volga-bogatyr and Oaf stylized as national folk songs. They were written between 1871 and 1874 for his Russian Book for Reading, a collection of short stories in four volumes (total of 629 stories in various genres) published along with the New Azbuka textbook and addressed to schoolchildren. Nevertheless, he was skeptical about poetry as a genre. As he famously said, \"Writing poetry is like ploughing and dancing at the same time.\" According to Valentin Bulgakov, he criticised poets, including Alexander Pushkin, for their \"false\" epithets used \"simply to make it rhyme.\"\n\nCritical appraisal by other authors\nTolstoy's contemporaries paid him lofty tributes. Fyodor Dostoyevsky, who died thirty years before Tolstoy, admired and was delighted by Tolstoy's novels (and, conversely, Tolstoy also admired Dostoyevsky's work). Gustave Flaubert, on reading a translation of War and Peace, exclaimed, \"What an artist and what a psychologist!\" Anton Chekhov, who often visited Tolstoy at his country estate, wrote, \"When literature possesses a Tolstoy, it is easy and pleasant to be a writer; even when you know you have achieved nothing yourself and are still achieving nothing, this is not as terrible as it might otherwise be, because Tolstoy achieves for everyone. What he does serves to justify all the hopes and aspirations invested in literature.\" The 19th-century British poet and critic Matthew Arnold opined that \"A novel by Tolstoy is not a work of art but a piece of life.\" Isaac Babel said that \"if the world could write by itself, it would write like Tolstoy.\"\nLater novelists continued to appreciate Tolstoy's art, but sometimes also expressed criticism. Arthur Conan Doyle wrote, \"I am attracted by his earnestness and by his power of detail, but I am repelled by his looseness of construction and by his unreasonable and impracticable mysticism.\" Virginia Woolf declared him \"the greatest of all novelists.\" James Joyce noted that, \"He is never dull, never stupid, never tired, never pedantic, never theatrical!\" Thomas Mann wrote of Tolstoy's seemingly guileless artistry: \"Seldom did art work so much like nature.\" Vladimir Nabokov heaped superlatives upon The Death of Ivan Ilyich and Anna Karenina; he questioned, however, the reputation of War and Peace, and sharply criticized Resurrection and The Kreutzer Sonata. However, Nabokov called Tolstoy the \"greatest Russian writer of prose fiction\". Critic Harold Bloom called Hadji Murat \"my personal touchstone for the sublime in prose fiction, to me the best story in the world.\" When William Faulkner was asked to list what he thought were the three greatest novels, he replied: \"Anna Karenina, Anna Karenina, and Anna Karenina\". Critic Gary Saul Morson referred to War and Peace as the greatest of all novels.\n\nEthical, political and religious beliefs\nSchopenhauer\nAfter reading Schopenhauer's The World as Will and Representation, Tolstoy gradually became converted to the ascetic morality upheld in that work as the proper spiritual path for the upper classes. In 1869 he writes: \"Do you know what this summer has meant for me? Constant raptures over Schopenhauer and a whole series of spiritual delights which I've never experienced before....no student has ever studied so much on his course, and learned so much, as I have this summer.\"\n\nIn Chapter VI of Confession, Tolstoy quoted the final paragraph of Schopenhauer's work. It explains how a complete denial of self causes only a relative nothingness which is not to be feared. Tolstoy was struck by the description of Christian, Buddhist, and Hindu ascetic renunciation as being the path to holiness. After reading passages such as the following, which abound in Schopenhauer's ethical chapters, the Russian nobleman chose poverty and formal denial of the will:  But this very necessity of involuntary suffering (by poor people) for eternal salvation is also expressed by that utterance of the Savior (Matthew 19:24): \"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.\" Therefore, those who were greatly in earnest about their eternal salvation, chose voluntary poverty when fate had denied this to them and they had been born in wealth. Thus Buddha Sakyamuni was born a prince, but voluntarily took to the mendicant's staff; and Francis of Assisi, the founder of the mendicant orders who, as a youngster at a ball, where the daughters of all the notabilities were sitting together, was asked: \"Now Francis, will you not soon make your choice from these beauties?\" and who replied: \"I have made a far more beautiful choice!\" \"Whom?\" \"La povert\u00e0 (poverty)\": whereupon he abandoned every thing shortly afterwards and wandered through the land as a mendicant.\n\nChristianity\nIn 1884, Tolstoy wrote a book called What I Believe, in which he openly confessed his Christian beliefs. He affirmed his belief in Jesus Christ's teachings and was particularly influenced by the Sermon on the Mount, and the injunction to turn the other cheek, which he understood as a \"commandment of non-resistance to evil by force\" and a doctrine of pacifism and nonviolence. In his work The Kingdom of God Is Within You, he explains that he considered mistaken the Church's doctrine because they had made a \"perversion\" of Christ's teachings. Tolstoy also received letters from American Quakers who introduced him to the non-violence writings of Quaker Christians such as George Fox, William Penn, and Jonathan Dymond. \nLater, various versions of \"Tolstoy's Bible\" were published, indicating the passages Tolstoy most relied on, specifically, the reported words of Jesus himself.\n\nTolstoy believed that a true Christian could find lasting happiness by striving for inner perfection through following the Great Commandment of loving one's neighbor and God, rather than guidance from the Church or state. Another distinct attribute of his philosophy based on Christ's teachings is nonresistance during conflict. This idea in Tolstoy's book The Kingdom of God Is Within You directly influenced Mahatma Gandhi and therefore also nonviolent resistance movements to this day.\nTolstoy believed that the aristocracy was a burden on the poor. He opposed private land ownership and the institution of marriage, and valued chastity and sexual abstinence (discussed in Father Sergius and his preface to The Kreutzer Sonata), ideals also held by the young Gandhi. Tolstoy's passion from the depth of his austere moral views is reflected in his later work. One example is the sequence of the temptation of Sergius in Father Sergius. Maxim Gorky relates how Tolstoy once read this passage before him and Chekhov, and Tolstoy was moved to tears by the end of the reading. Later passages of rare power include the personal crises faced by the protagonists of The Death of Ivan Ilyich, and of Master and Man, where the main character in the former and the reader in the latter are made aware of the foolishness of the protagonists' lives.\nIn 1886, Tolstoy wrote to the Russian explorer and anthropologist Nicholas Miklouho-Maclay, who was one of the first anthropologists to refute polygenism, the view that the different races of mankind belonged to different species: \"You were the first to demonstrate beyond question by your experience that man is man everywhere, that is, a kind, sociable being with whom communication can and should be established through kindness and truth, not guns and spirits.\"\n\nChristian anarchism\nTolstoy had a profound influence on the development of Christian anarchist thought. Tolstoy believed being a Christian required him to be a pacifist; the apparently inevitable waging of war by governments is why he is considered a philosophical anarchist.\n\nThe Tolstoyans were a small Christian anarchist group formed by Tolstoy's companion, Vladimir Chertkov (1854\u20131936), to spread Tolstoy's religious teachings. From 1892 he regularly met with the student-activist Vasily Maklakov who would defend several Tolstoyans; they discussed the fate of the Doukhobors. Philosopher Peter Kropotkin wrote of Tolstoy in the article on anarchism in the 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica:Without naming himself an anarchist, Leo Tolstoy, like his predecessors in the popular religious movements of the 15th and 16th centuries, Chojecki, Denk and many others, took the anarchist position as regards the state and property rights, deducing his conclusions from the general spirit of the teachings of Jesus and from the necessary dictates of reason. With all the might of his talent, Tolstoy made (especially in The Kingdom of God Is Within You) a powerful criticism of the church, the state and law altogether, and especially of the present property laws. He describes the state as the domination of the wicked ones, supported by brutal force. Robbers, he says, are far less dangerous than a well-organized government. He makes a searching criticism of the prejudices which are current now concerning the benefits conferred upon men by the church, the state, and the existing distribution of property, and from the teachings of Jesus he deduces the rule of non-resistance and the absolute condemnation of all wars. His religious arguments are, however, so well combined with arguments borrowed from a dispassionate observation of the present evils, that the anarchist portions of his works appeal to the religious and the non-religious reader alike.\n\nIn hundreds of essays over the last 20 years of his life, Tolstoy reiterated the anarchist critique of the state and recommended books by Kropotkin and Proudhon to his readers, while rejecting anarchism's espousal of violent revolutionary means. In the 1900 essay, \"On Anarchy,\" he wrote: \"The Anarchists are right in everything; in the negation of the existing order, and in the assertion that, without Authority, there could not be worse violence than that of Authority under existing conditions. They are mistaken only in thinking that Anarchy can be instituted by a revolution. But it will be instituted only by there being more and more people who do not require the protection of governmental power ... There can be only one permanent revolution \u2013 a moral one: the regeneration of the inner man.\" Despite his misgivings about anarchist violence, Tolstoy took risks to circulate the prohibited publications of anarchist thinkers in Russia, and corrected the proofs of Kropotkin's \"Words of a Rebel\", illegally published in St Petersburg in 1906.\n\nPacificism\nIn 1908, Tolstoy wrote A Letter to a Hindu outlining his belief in non-violence as a means for India to gain independence from colonial rule. In 1909, Gandhi read a copy of the letter when he was becoming an activist in South Africa. He wrote to Tolstoy seeking proof that he was the author, which led to further correspondence. Tolstoy's The Kingdom of God Is Within You also helped to convince Gandhi of nonviolent resistance, a debt Gandhi acknowledged in his autobiography, calling Tolstoy \"the greatest apostle of non-violence that the present age has produced\". Their correspondence lasted only a year, from October 1909 until Tolstoy's death in November 1910, but led Gandhi to give the name Tolstoy Colony to his second ashram in South Africa. Both men also believed in the merits of vegetarianism, the subject of several of Tolstoy's essays.\nThe Boxer Rebellion stirred Tolstoy's interest in Chinese philosophy. He was a famous sinophile, and read the works of Confucius and Lao Zi. Tolstoy wrote Chinese Wisdom and other texts about China. Tolstoy corresponded with the Chinese intellectual Gu Hongming and recommended that China remain an agrarian nation, and not reform like Japan. Tolstoy and Gu opposed the Hundred Day's Reform by Kang Youwei and believed that the reform movement was perilous. Tolstoy's ideology of non-violence shaped the thought of the Chinese anarchist group Society for the Study of Socialism.\nTolstoy denounced the intervention by the Eight-Nation Alliance (which included Russia) in the Boxer Rebellion in China, the Filipino-American War, and the Second Boer War.\nTolstoy praised the Boxer Rebellion and harshly criticized the atrocities of the Russian, German, American, Japanese, and other troops of the Eight-Nation alliance. He heard about the looting, rapes, and murders, and accused the troops of slaughter and \"Christian brutality.\" He named the monarchs most responsible for the atrocities as Tsar Nicholas II and Kaiser Wilhelm II. He described the intervention as \"terrible for its injustice and cruelty\". The war was also criticized by other intellectuals such as Leonid Andreyev and Gorky. As part of the criticism, Tolstoy wrote an epistle called To the Chinese people. In 1902, he wrote an open letter describing and denouncing Nicholas II's activities in China.\nTolstoy also became a major supporter of the Esperanto movement. He was impressed by the pacifist beliefs of the Doukhobors and brought their persecution to the attention of the international community, after they burned their weapons in peaceful protest in 1895. He aided the Doukhobors to migrate to Canada. He also provided inspiration to the Mennonites, another religious group with anti-government and anti-war sentiments. In 1904, Tolstoy condemned the ensuing Russo-Japanese War and wrote to the Japanese Buddhist priest Soyen Shaku in a failed attempt to make a joint pacifist statement.\n\nGeorgism\nTowards the end of his life, Tolstoy became occupied with the economic theory and social philosophy of Georgism. He incorporated it approvingly into works such as Resurrection (1899), the book that was a major cause for his excommunication. He spoke with great admiration of Henry George, stating once that \"People do not argue with the teaching of George; they simply do not know it. And it is impossible to do otherwise with his teaching, for he who becomes acquainted with it cannot but agree.\" He also wrote a preface to George's journal Social Problems. Tolstoy and George both rejected private property in land (the most important source of income for Russian aristocracy that Tolstoy heavily criticized). They also rejected a centrally planned socialist economy. Because Georgism requires an administration to collect land rent and spend it on infrastructure, some assume that this embrace moved Tolstoy away from his anarchist views. However, anarchist versions of Georgism have been proposed since then. Resurrection, in which the nobleman Dmitri Ivanovich Nekhlyudov realizes that the earth cannot really be owned and that everyone should have equal access to its resources and advantages, hints that Tolstoy had such a view. Other works, such as Tolstoy's unfinished play \"The Light that Shines in the Darkness\u201d and the short story \"How Much Land Does a Man Need?\u201d, suggest Tolstoy's approval of small communities with local governance to manage the collective land rents for common goods, and heavily criticize state institutions such as the justice system.\n\nHunting\nTolstoy was introduced to hunting by his father, who was an avid huntsman. He was trained to hunt from a young age and became a passionate huntsman himself. He was known to shoot duck, quail, snipe, woodcock and otters. For example, Tolstoy wrote in his diary on 23 March 1852, \"the weather was marvellous; went out hunting, rode up and down the undulating country till one. Killed two ducks.\" His novel War and Peace included hunting scenes. Tolstoy spent decades hunting, but stopped sometime in the 1880s and became a staunch opponent of hunting due to ethical concerns about killing. In 1890 Tolstoy wrote a preface for Vladimir Chertkov's anti-hunting pamphlet Zlaia zabava: Mysli ob okhote (An Evil Pastime: Thoughts about Hunting). Although Tolstoy in his later life opposed hunting, he never abandoned his love for horse-riding.\n\nVegetarianism\nTolstoy first became interested in vegetarianism in 1882; however, his conversion to a vegetarian diet was a long and gradual process. William Fay (Vladimir Konstantinovich Geins), who visited Tolstoy in Autumn 1885,  influenced Tolstoy to become vegetarian. In 1887, Tolstoy was lapsing from a vegetarian diet by occasionally eating meat. It was only from 1890 that Tolstoy adopted a strict vegetarian diet which he was alleged to have never consciously betrayed. Tolstoy's wife Sophia argued that his vegetarian diet did not provide him enough nourishment and contributed to his digestive ailments, however, Tolstoy stated that his health was not deprived on the diet but had improved. Critics of Tolstoy such as I. S. Listovsky suggested that Tolstoy's writing talent went into decline after he adopted a meatless diet.\nTolstoy became a vegetarian for ethical and spiritual reasons, associating a meatless diet with \"high moral views on life\". He viewed both hunting and eating meat as a moral evil as they involve unnecessary cruelty to animals and regretted his former habits. In 1891, Tolstoy obtained a copy of Howard Williams's book The Ethics of Diet from Chertkov. His daughters translated the book into Russian and Tolstoy wrote an introductory essay titled \"The First Step\", published in 1893. In his introductory essay, he described a cruel experience he had witnessed at a visit to a slaughterhouse in Tula. The cruelty he had witnessed confirmed his belief that meat should be removed from the diet. In the essay he wrote that meat eating is \"simply immoral, as it involves the performance of an act which is contrary to moral feeling \u2013 killing\".\nWhilst on his vegetarian diet, Tolstoy was eating eggs daily but was questioned by one of his friends if eating eggs amounts to taking life. He commented that \"Yes, I ought to have stopped taking eggs. At least from now I shall stop it\". By 1903, Tolstoy had removed eggs from his diet. Vasily Rozanov who had visited Tolstoy noted that vegetarianism was a way of living for Tolstoy and at the dinner table surrounded by family and guests who were eating meat and scrambled eggs, Tolstoy was eating kasha. In a letter to A. D. Zutphen (a Dutch medical student), Tolstoy wrote that \"My health not only has not suffered; it has in fact improved significantly since I have given up milk, butter and eggs, as well as sugar, tea, and coffee.\" Tolstoy described his vegetarian diet consisting of oatmeal porridge, whole wheat bread, cabbage or potato soup, buckwheat, a boiled or fried potato and an apple prune compote.\n\nDeath\nTolstoy died on 20 November 1910 at the age of 82. Just before his death, his health was a concern of his family, who cared for him daily. In his last days, he spoke and wrote about dying. Renouncing his aristocratic lifestyle, he left home one winter night. His secretive departure was an apparent attempt to escape from his wife's tirades. She spoke out against many of his teachings, and in recent years had grown envious of his attention to Tolstoyan \"disciples\".\nTolstoy died of pneumonia at Astapovo railway station, after a day's train journey south. The station master took Tolstoy to his apartment, and his personal doctors arrived and gave him injections of morphine and camphor.\nThe police took extra precautions to minimize dissent during the funeral ceremonies. They were inconspicuous but looming during the funeral itself, which two thousand people attended without incident. Three choirs sang. There were no eulogies, per the family's request, though 100 students had asked to speak.\nAccording to some sources, Tolstoy spent the last hours of his life preaching love, non-violence, and Georgism to fellow passengers on the train.\n\nLegacy\nAlthough Leo Tolstoy was regarded as a Christian anarchist and not a socialist, his ideas and works still influenced socialist thinkers throughout history. He held an unromantic view of governments as being essentially violent forces held together by intimidation from state authority, corruption on behalf of officials, and the indoctrination of people from a young age. In regard to his view of economics, he advocated for a return to subsistence agriculture. In his view, a simplified economy would afford a lesser need for the exchange of goods, and as such, factories and cities \u2013 the centers of industry \u2013 would become obsolete.\nIn 1944, literary historian and Soviet medievalist Nikolai Gudzii wrote a biography of Tolstoy that spanned 80 pages. It was designed to show readers that Tolstoy would have revised his pacifistic and anti-patriotic sentiments if he were alive amid World War II. At around the same time, literary scholar and historian Boris Eikhenbaum \u2013 in a stark contrast from his earlier works on Tolstoy \u2013 portrayed the Russian novelist as someone whose ideas aligned with those of early utopian socialists such as Robert Owen and Henri Saint-Simon. Eikenbaum suggested that these influences can be seen in Tolstoy's emphases on individual happiness and peasant welfare. The discrepancies in Eikenbaum's portrayals of Tolstoy can be attributed to the political pressure in Soviet Russia at the time: public officials pressured literary scholars to conform with party doctrine.\n\nIn Soviet Russia\nFrom Tolstoy's writings the Tolstoyan movement was birthed, and its members used his works to promote non-violence, anti-urbanism and opposition to the state. While Tolstoy himself never associated with the movement, as he was opposed to joining any organization or group, he named his thirteenth child Alexandra (Sasha) L'vovna Tolstaya the heir to his works with the intention that she would publish them for the Russian people. Meanwhile, Tolstoy designated Vladimir Chertkov \u2013 who kept many of Tolstoy's manuscripts \u2013 as the editor of his works. Originally Tolstoy wanted to make the Russian people the heirs to his writings, but Russian law at the time decreed that property could only be inherited by one individual.\nFollowing the Russian Civil War in 1917, writings that were formerly censored could now be published, since all literary works were nationalized in November 1918. Alexandra worked during these years to publish sets of Tolstoy's works: from 1917 to 1919, she worked with Zadruga Publishing House to publish thirteen booklets on Tolstoy's writings, which had previously been censored under Russia's imperial rule. However, publishing a complete collection of Tolstoy's works proved to be more difficult. In December 1918, the Commissariat of Education granted Chertkov a 10 million rouble subsidy to publish a complete edition of his works, but it never materialized due to government control of publication rights. Cooperatives were additionally made illegal in Russia in 1921, creating another obstacle for Alexandra and Chertkov.\nIn the 1920s, Tolstoy's estate, Yasnaya Polyana, was sanctioned by the Soviet state to exist as a commune for Tolstoyans. The government permitted this Christian-oriented community because they felt that religious sects like the Tolstoyans were models for the Russian peasantry. The Soviet government owned the estate, which was deemed a memorial for the late Russian writer, but Alexandra had jurisdiction over the education offered at Yasnaya Polyana. Unlike most Soviet schools, the schooling at Yasnaya Polyana did not offer militaristic training and did not teach atheism. Over time, though, local communists \u2013 as opposed to the state government, which financially supported the institution \u2013 often denounced the estate and called for frequent inspections. After 1928, a change in cultural policy in the Soviet regime led to a takeover of local institutions, including Tolstoy's estate. When Alexandra stepped down from her role as head of Yasnaya Poliana in 1929, the Commissariat of Education and Health took control.\nIn 1925, the Soviet government created its first Jubilee Committee to celebrate the centennial of Tolstoy's birth, which originally consisted of 13 members but grew to 38 members after a second committee formed in 1927. Alexandra was not content with the funds provided by the government and met with Stalin in June 1928. During the meeting, Stalin said the government could not provide the one million roubles requested by the committee. However, an agreement was reached with the State Publishing House in April 1928 for the publishing of a 92-volume collection of Tolstoy's works. During the Jubilee Celebration, Anatoly Luncharsky \u2013 the head of the People's Commissariat for Education \u2013 gave a speech in which he denied reports that claimed the Soviet government was hostile towards Tolstoy and his legacy. Instead of focusing on the aspects of Tolstoy's works that pitted him against the Soviet regime, he instead focused on the unifying aspects, such as Tolstoy's love for equality and labor as well as his disdain for the state and private property. More than 400 million copies of Tolstoy's works have been printed in the Soviet Union, making him the best-selling author in Soviet Russia.\n\nInfluence\nVladimir Lenin wrote several essays about Tolstoy, suggesting that a contradiction exists within his critique of Russian society. According to Lenin, Tolstoy \u2013 who adored the peasantry and voiced their discontent with imperial Russian society \u2013 may have been revolutionary in his critiques, but his political consciousness was not fully developed for a revolution. Lenin uses this line of thinking to suggest that the 1905 Russian Revolution, which he called a \"peasant bourgeois revolution,\" failed because of its backwardness: the revolutionaries wanted to dismantle the existing medieval forms of oppression and replace them with an old and patriarchal village-commune. Tolstoy's concept of non-resistance to evil additionally hindered the 1905 revolution's success, Lenin thought, because the movement was not militant and had thus allowed the autocracy to crush them. Nevertheless, Lenin concludes in his writings that despite the many contradictions in Tolstoy's critiques, his hatred for feudalism and capitalism mark the prelude to proletarian socialism.\nAdditionally, Tolstoy's philosophy of non-resistance to evil made an impact on Mahatma Gandhi's political thinking. Gandhi was deeply moved by Tolstoy's concept of truth, which, in his view, constitutes any doctrine that reduces suffering. For both Gandhi and Tolstoy, truth is God, and since God is universal love, truth must therefore also be universal love. The Gujarati word for Gandhi's non-violent movement is \"satyagraha\", derived from the word \"sadagraha\" \u2013 the \"sat\" portion translating to \"truth\", and the \"agraha\" translating to \"firmness\". Gandhi's conception of satyagraha was birthed from Tolstoy's understanding of Christianity, rather than from Hindu tradition.\n\nIn films and television\nThe Death of Ivan Ilyich was adapted by Akira Kurosawa as Ikiru (1952). It was also the basis for  Living (2022), with a screenplay by Kazuo Ishiguro. \nIn the George Lucas television show, The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, later retitled The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones, a fictional Tolstoy appears as a mentor figure and friend of Indiana Jones. In the made for TV movie Travels with Father (1996), he is portrayed by Michael Gough.\nA 2009 film about Tolstoy's final year, The Last Station, based on the 1990 novel by Jay Parini, was made by director Michael Hoffman with Christopher Plummer as Tolstoy and Helen Mirren as Sofya Tolstoya. Both performers were nominated for Oscars for their roles. There have been other films about the writer, including Departure of a Grand Old Man, made in 1912 just two years after his death, How Fine, How Fresh the Roses Were (1913), and Lev Tolstoy, directed by and starring Sergei Gerasimov in 1984. \nThere is also a famous lost film of Tolstoy made a decade before he died. In 1901, the American travel lecturer Burton Holmes visited Yasnaya Polyana with Albert J. Beveridge, the U.S. senator and historian. As the three men conversed, Holmes filmed Tolstoy with his 60-mm movie camera. Afterwards, Beveridge's advisers succeeded in having the film destroyed, fearing that the meeting with the Russian author might hurt Beveridge's chances of running for the U.S. presidency.\n\nBibliography\nSee also\nAnarchism and religion\nChristian vegetarianism\nLeo Tolstoy bibliography\nLeo Tolstoy and Theosophy\nList of peace activists\nTolstoyan movement\nHenry David Thoreau\nWar & Peace (2016 TV series)\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nFurther reading\nBayley, John (1997).

Its screenplay by Kazuo Ishiguro was adapted from the 1952 Akira Kurosawa film Ikiru. Set in 1953 London, it stars Bill Nighy as a bureaucrat in the public works department who learns he has a fatal illness.\nLiving had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on 21 January 2022, and was released in the UK on 4 November 2022, by Lionsgate. The film received positive reviews, with Nighy's performance receiving particular acclaim. At the 95th Academy Awards, Living received two nominations: Best Actor for Nighy and Best Adapted Screenplay for Ishiguro.\n\nPlot\nRodney Williams is a senior London County Council bureaucrat in 1953 London. He sits at his desk surrounded by piles of paperwork, and seems uninspired. A group of women, led by Mrs Smith, petition the council to have a World War II bombsite redeveloped into a children's playground. They are sent with their petition from department to department with a newer employee, Mr. Wakeling. Despite Wakeling's enthusiasm, he is stymied by an ossified and sclerotic bureauracy at every step. The petition makes the usual circular rounds and ends back with Williams, who places it back in his pile of paperwork, making clear to his colleagues his intention to take no further action.\nWhen Williams receives a terminal cancer diagnosis he attempts unsuccessfully to tell his son Michael and daughter-in-law, Fiona. Williams then chooses to withdraw half of his life savings, purchase a lethal amount of sleeping medicine, and commit suicide in a seaside resort town. Finding himself unable to go through with it, he gives the sleeping medicine to Mr. Sutherland, an insomniac writer he meets in a caf\u00e9. Moved by Williams's story, Sutherland takes him for a night on the town, where Williams replaces his traditional bowler hat with a fedora after his bowler hat is stolen by a prostitute. The pair go to bars, sing, drink heavily and attend a striptease\/burlesque show. \nReturning to London but not to work, Williams runs into Miss Margaret Harris, a young former subordinate who took up a position at a Lyon's Corner House restaurant while he was away. Williams's nosy neighbour spots the pair having lunch at the high-end restaurant Fortnum's and tells Fiona, who demands Michael speak to his father about the potential scandal. Meanwhile, Williams attempts to tell Michael about his diagnosis, but neither find themselves able to bring up what they need to talk about. \nAs Williams's health worsens, he attempts to spend more time with Harris, whose youthful vigour he envies and would like to regain before he dies. Realising the best way to spend his remaining time is to do some good, Williams rallies the various departments to approve construction of the children's playground. During this time, through their mutual respect for Williams, Harris and Wakeling have grown fond of each other and are seen taking walks and sitting in parks together.  \nAlthough he is able to push the process through by standing up to his colleagues and superiors, Williams dies shortly after construction is finished. At his funeral, well-attended by the people he has helped, Michael guesses that Williams had told Harris about his diagnosis but not him. \nInspired by Williams's actions, his former colleagues pledge to uphold his example and become advocates for positive change, but soon revert to their old bureaucratic ways. Wakeling, who joined the office shortly before Williams's diagnosis, reads a letter left for him by Williams instructing him to remember the playground when he gets discouraged. Visiting the playground, Wakeling meets a police officer who tells him that he saw Williams there shortly before he died, rocking in the swing in the snow and singing the Scottish folk song \"The Rowan Tree.\" The constable feels guilty that he let Williams sit in the cold in his condition. Wakeling consoles the officer, saying that Rodney Williams was probably happier in that moment than he had been for a very long time.\n\nCast\nProduction\nIn October 2020, the project was announced with Nobel Prize-winning novelist Ishiguro as screenwriter, and Nighy and Wood attached to star. In December 2020, Lionsgate acquired the UK distribution rights. In June 2021, principal photography began in the UK, Sharp and Burke were announced to have joined the film, and the first image from the film was released. It was also announced that Toho, the distributor of the original film, had acquired the rights for Japan. London's County Hall provided the backdrop for the film; in addition, the film was co-financed through the County Hall Arts charity.\n\nRelease\nThe film premiered at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival on 21 January 2022. Shortly after, Sony Pictures Classics acquired distribution rights to the film for North and Latin America, India, Scandinavia, Eastern Europe, Germany, South Africa, Southeast Asia and airlines worldwide for around $5 million in an auction that also included Neon, Bleecker Street and Focus Features among others. Living screened at the 66th BFI London Film Festival in October 2022 and at the TCL Chinese Theatre as part of the 2022 AFI Fest on 6 November 2022. The film was released theatrically in the United Kingdom on 4 November 2022, and had a limited theatrical release in the United States on 23 December 2022. As part of Sony's first-window deal with Netflix in the United States, the movie streamed from 5 June 2023.\n\nReception\nCritical reception\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 96% based on 221 reviews, with an average rating of 8\/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \"Living sets a high bar for itself in setting out to remake a Kurosawa classic\u2014and director Oliver Hermanus and star Bill Nighy clear it in triumphant fashion.\" On Metacritic, it holds a weighted average score of 81 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\nMatt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com gave the film three out of four stars and wrote, \"Living isn't a great movie\u2014it's a little too subdued at times and has a tendency to fixate on Williams' mostly unarticulated sadness\u2014but it's consistently involving.\"\nRichard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times also gave the film three out of four stars and wrote, \"About two-thirds of the way through the film, Living takes such an abrupt turn that it almost feels as if several key scenes had been inadvertently excised \u2014 but then we wind back in time, and all is answered. Throughout, Bill Nighy carries the film effortlessly on his slender shoulders, reminding us of why he's an international treasure.\"\n\nAccolades\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nLiving at IMDb \nOfficial screenplay","114":"Madadayo (\u307e\u3042\u3060\u3060\u3088, M\u0101dadayo, \"Not yet\") is a 1993 Japanese comedy-drama film. It is the thirtieth and final film to be completed by Akira Kurosawa. It was screened out of competition at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival. The film was selected as the Japanese entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 66th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.\n\nPlot\nThe film is based on the life of Japanese academic and author Hyakken Uchida (1889\u20131971). While playfully teaching a class as a  professor of German in the period immediately before the Second World War, Uchida tearfully announces his retirement to his crestfallen students.  In 1943, he moves into a spacious house but his wife is concerned about the safety of the neighborhood. Two students arrive to pretend to burglarize the home, but instead find a series of directions written by Uchida on how to break in to the house.  \nHe hosts a dinner for several of his students, but as a result of wartime shortages he is embarrassed that he and his wife can only serve venison and horse meat.  Their house burns down as a result of U.S. bombing raids, and Uchida and his wife are forced to live in a small shack with no indoor toilet with their few remaining possessions.\nAfter the end of the war, his former students get together to host a banquet to honor him.  Asked several times whether he is ready to die, he replies repeatedly, \u201cNot yet\", so naturally the banquet is named \u201cthe Not Yet Banquet.\u201d At the end of the raucous celebration, two American military policemen arrive but smile after they see that everyone is enjoying themselves.\nWith the help of his students, he builds a new house for himself and his wife with a pond that has a small island in the middle.  A stray alley cat arrives and he eventually adopts the cat, aptly naming it Alley.\nThe lot across from the couple is purchased by a developer who believes their house will be in the way and insists on purchasing it.  Uchida refuses, and realizes that developing the lot will tower over his house.  His students get together, purchase the lot, and return it to the seller who needed the money but also needed the lot.  The seller promises not to disturb Uchida's view.\nAlley disappears during a storm.  Uchiro is heartbroken and sinks into a deep depression.  He conducts numerous searches, enlisting his students, local schools, and the townspeople.  Several false leads only lead him to further despair.  On a train, he thinks he sees Alley at a station, but the train pulls away.  He never sees Alley again.\nSoon after, another cat appears.  He names it Kurz (German for 'short') and with the new cat, his depression lifts.\nHis former students hold the seventeenth Not Yet Banquet.  No longer an all-men's affair, children of his students present him with flowers, and the students' grandchildren present him with a large cake.  After receiving the cake and giving his remarks, he collapses from arrhythmia.  He is taken home to rest.  He falls asleep and dreams of playing Hide-and-seek as a child.  The other children keep asking if he's ready while he is looking for a place to hide and he replies, \"not yet\".  He finally finds a place to hide, and in so doing, looks out toward a golden sun.\nMany of the movie's vignettes, like the search for a missing cat and the time Uchida spent in a one-room hut after his home was destroyed in a bombing raid, come from Uchida's own writings, but the movie also gives Kurosawa the chance to comment on aspects of modern Japanese history like the American occupation of Japan that he had only been able to explore indirectly in his earlier works.\n\nCast\nTatsuo Matsumura \u2013 Professor Hyakken Uchida\nKy\u014dko Kagawa \u2013 Professor's Wife\nHisashi Igawa \u2013 Takayama\nGeorge Tokoro \u2013 Amaki\nMasayuki Yui \u2013 Kiriyama\nAkira Terao \u2013 Sawamura\nTakeshi Kusaka \u2013 Dr. Kobayashi\nAsei Kobayashi \u2013 Rev.

It is thought to have been first performed in 1606. It dramatises the damaging physical and psychological effects of political ambition on those who seek power. Of all the plays that Shakespeare wrote during the reign of James I, Macbeth most clearly reflects his relationship with King James, patron of Shakespeare's acting company. It was first published in the Folio of 1623, possibly from a prompt book, and is Shakespeare's shortest tragedy.\nA brave Scottish general named Macbeth receives a prophecy from a trio of witches that one day he will become King of Scotland. Consumed by ambition and spurred to action by his wife, Macbeth murders King Duncan and takes the Scottish throne for himself. He is then racked with guilt and paranoia. Forced to commit more and more murders to protect himself from enmity and suspicion, he soon becomes a tyrannical ruler. The bloodbath and consequent civil war swiftly take Macbeth and Lady Macbeth into the realms of madness and death.\nShakespeare's source for the story is the account of Macbeth, King of Scotland, Macduff, and Duncan in Holinshed's Chronicles (1587), a history of England, Scotland, and Ireland familiar to Shakespeare and his contemporaries, although the events in the play differ extensively from the history of the real Macbeth. The events of the tragedy have been associated with the execution of Henry Garnet for complicity in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605.\nIn the backstage world of theatre, some believe that the play is cursed and will not mention its title aloud, referring to it instead as \"The Scottish Play\". The play has attracted some of the most renowned actors to the roles of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth and has been adapted to film, television, opera, novels, comics, and other media.\n\nCharacters\nPlot\nAct I\nAmid thunder and lightning, Three Witches decide that their next meeting will be with Macbeth. In the following scene, a wounded sergeant reports to King Duncan of Scotland that his generals Banquo and Macbeth, the Thane of Glamis, have just defeated the allied forces of Norway and Ireland, who were led by the traitorous Macdonwald and the Thane of Cawdor. Macbeth, the King's kinsman, is praised for his bravery and fighting prowess.\nIn the following scene, Macbeth and Banquo discuss the weather and their victory. As they wander onto a heath, the Three Witches enter and greet them with prophecies. Though Banquo challenges them first, they address Macbeth, hailing him as \"Thane of Glamis\", \"Thane of Cawdor\", and that he will \"be King hereafter\". Macbeth appears to be stunned to silence. When Banquo asks of his own fortunes, the witches respond that he will father a line of kings, though he himself will not be one. While the two men wonder at these pronouncements, the witches vanish, and another thane, Ross, arrives and informs Macbeth of his newly bestowed title: Thane of Cawdor. The first prophecy is thus fulfilled, and Macbeth, previously sceptical, immediately begins to harbour ambitions of becoming king.\nKing Duncan welcomes and praises Macbeth and Banquo, and Duncan declares that he will spend the night at Macbeth's castle at Inverness; Duncan also names his son Malcolm as his heir. Macbeth sends a message ahead to his wife, Lady Macbeth, telling her about the witches' prophecies. Lady Macbeth suffers none of her husband's uncertainty and wishes him to murder Duncan in order to obtain kingship. When Macbeth arrives at Inverness, she overrides all of her husband's objections by challenging his manhood and successfully persuades him to kill the king that very night. He and Lady Macbeth plan to get Duncan's two chamberlains drunk so that they will black out; the next morning they will frame the chamberlains for the murder. Since the chamberlains would remember nothing whatsoever, they would be blamed for the deed.\n\nAct II\nWhile Duncan is asleep, Macbeth stabs him, despite his doubts and a number of supernatural portents, including a hallucination of a bloody dagger. He is so shaken that Lady Macbeth has to take charge. In accordance with her plan, she frames Duncan's sleeping servants for the murder by placing bloody daggers on them. Early the next morning, Lennox, a Scottish nobleman, and Macduff, the loyal Thane of Fife, arrive. A porter opens the gate and Macbeth leads them to the king's chamber, where Macduff discovers Duncan's body. Macbeth murders the guards to prevent them from professing their innocence, but claims he did so in a fit of anger over their misdeeds. Duncan's sons Malcolm and Donalbain flee to England and Ireland, respectively, fearing that whoever killed Duncan desires their demise as well. The rightful heirs' flight makes them suspects and Macbeth assumes the throne as the new King of Scotland as a kinsman of the dead king. Banquo reveals this to the audience, and while sceptical of the new King Macbeth, he remembers the witches' prophecy about how his own descendants would inherit the throne; this makes him suspicious of Macbeth.\n\nAct III\nDespite his success, Macbeth, also aware of this part of the prophecy, remains uneasy. Macbeth invites Banquo to a royal banquet, where he discovers that Banquo and his young son, Fleance, will be riding out that night. Fearing Banquo's suspicions, Macbeth arranges to have him murdered, by hiring two men to kill them, later sending a third murderer, presumably to ensure that the deed is completed. The assassins succeed in killing Banquo, but Fleance escapes. Macbeth becomes furious: he fears that his power remains insecure as long as an heir of Banquo remains alive.\nAt the banquet, Macbeth invites his lords and Lady Macbeth to a night of drinking and merriment. Banquo's ghost enters and sits in Macbeth's place. Macbeth raves fearfully, startling his guests, as the ghost is visible only to him. The others panic at the sight of Macbeth raging at an empty chair, until a desperate Lady Macbeth tells them that her husband is merely afflicted with a familiar and harmless malady. The ghost departs and returns once more, causing the same riotous anger and fear in Macbeth. This time, Lady Macbeth tells the visitors to leave, and they do so. At the end Hecate, queen of the witches, scolds the three weird sisters for helping Macbeth, especially without consulting her. Hecate instructs the Witches to give Macbeth false security. (Some scholars believe the Hecate scene was added in later by a different author.)\n\nAct IV\nMacbeth, disturbed, visits the three witches once more and asks them to reveal the truth of their prophecies to him. To answer his questions, they summon horrible apparitions, each of which offers predictions and further prophecies to put Macbeth's fears at rest. First, they conjure an armoured head, which tells him to beware of Macduff (IV.i.72). Second, a bloody child tells him that no one born of a woman will be able to harm him. Thirdly, a crowned child holding a tree states that Macbeth will be safe until Great Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane Hill. Macbeth is relieved and feels secure because he knows that all men are born of women and forests cannot possibly move.\nMacbeth also asks whether Banquo's sons will ever reign in Scotland, to which the witches conjure a procession of eight crowned kings, all similar in appearance to Banquo, and the last carrying a mirror that reflects even more kings. Macbeth realises that these are all Banquo's descendants having acquired kingship in numerous countries.\nAfter the witches perform a mad dance and leave, Lennox enters and tells Macbeth that Macduff has fled to England. Macbeth orders Macduff's castle be seized and sends murderers to slaughter Macduff, his wife and children. Although Macduff is no longer in the castle, everyone in Macduff's castle is put to death, including Lady Macduff and their young son.\n\nAct V\nLady Macbeth becomes racked with guilt from the crimes she and her husband have committed. At night, in the king's palace at Dunsinane, a doctor and a gentlewoman discuss Lady Macbeth's strange habit of sleepwalking. Suddenly, Lady Macbeth enters in a trance with a candle in her hand. Bemoaning the murders of Duncan, Lady Macduff, and Banquo, she tries to wash off imaginary bloodstains from her hands, all the while speaking of the terrible things she knows she pressed her husband to do. She leaves, and the doctor and gentlewoman marvel at her descent into madness.\nIn England, Macduff is informed by Ross that his \"castle is surprised; wife and babes \/ Savagely slaughter'd\" (IV.iii.204\u2013205). When this news of his family's execution reaches him, Macduff is stricken with grief and vows revenge. Prince Malcolm, Duncan's son, has succeeded in raising an army in England, and Macduff joins him as he rides to Scotland to challenge Macbeth's forces. The invasion has the support of the Scottish nobles, who are appalled and frightened by Macbeth's tyrannical and murderous behaviour. Malcolm leads an army, along with Macduff and Englishmen Siward (the Elder), the Earl of Northumberland, against Dunsinane Castle. While encamped in Birnam Wood, the soldiers are ordered to cut down and carry tree branches to camouflage their numbers.\nBefore Macbeth's opponents arrive, he receives news that Lady Macbeth has killed herself, causing him to sink into a deep and pessimistic despair and deliver his \"To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow\" soliloquy (V.v.17\u201328). Though he reflects on the brevity and meaninglessness of life, he nevertheless awaits the Rebels and fortifies Dunsinane. He is certain that the witches' prophecies guarantee his invincibility, but is struck with fear when he learns that the Rebel army is advancing on Dunsinane shielded with boughs cut from Birnam Wood, in apparent fulfillment of one of the prophecies.\nA battle culminates in Macduff's confrontation with Macbeth, who kills Young Siward in combat. The Rebel forces overwhelm his army and castle. Macbeth boasts that he has no reason to fear Macduff, for he cannot be killed by any man born of woman. Macduff declares that he was \"from his mother's womb \/ Untimely ripp'd\" (V.8.15\u201316), (i.e., born by Caesarean section and not a natural birth) and is not \"of woman born\", fulfilling the second prophecy. Macbeth realises too late that he has misinterpreted the witches' words. Though he realises that he is doomed, and despite Macduff urging him to yield, he is unwilling to surrender and continues fighting. Macduff kills and beheads him, thus fulfilling the remaining prophecy.\nMacduff carries Macbeth's head onstage and Malcolm discusses how order has been restored. His last reference to Lady Macbeth reveals \"'tis thought, by self and violent hands \/ Took off her life\" (V.ix.71\u201372). Malcolm, now the King of Scotland, declares his benevolent intentions for the country and invites all to see him crowned at Scone.\nAlthough Malcolm, and not Fleance, is placed on the throne at the end of the play, the witches' prophecy concerning Banquo's descendants being kings was known to the audience of Shakespeare's time to be true. James VI of Scotland, who was later James I of England, was supposedly a descendant of Banquo.\n\nSources for the play\nA principal source comes from the Daemonologie of King James published in 1597 which included a news pamphlet titled Newes from Scotland that detailed the famous North Berwick witch trials of 1590. The publication of Daemonologie came just a few years before the tragedy of Macbeth with the themes and setting in a direct and comparative contrast with King James' personal obsessions with witchcraft, which developed following his conclusion that the stormy weather that threatened his passage from Denmark to Scotland was a targeted attack. Not only did the subsequent trials take place in Scotland, the women accused were recorded, under torture, of having conducted rituals with the same mannerisms as the three witches. One of the evidenced passages is referenced when the women under trial confessed to attempt the use of witchcraft to raise a tempest and sabotage the boat King James and his queen were on board during their return trip from Denmark. The three witches discuss the raising of winds at sea in the opening lines of Act 1 Scene 3.\nMacbeth has been compared to Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra. As characters, both Antony and Macbeth seek a new world, even at the cost of the old one. Both fight for a throne and have a 'nemesis' to face to achieve that throne. For Antony, the nemesis is Octavius; for Macbeth, it is Banquo. At one point Macbeth even compares himself to Antony, saying \"under Banquo \/ My Genius is rebuk'd, as it is said \/ Mark Antony's was by Caesar.\" Lastly, both plays contain powerful and manipulative female figures: Cleopatra and Lady Macbeth.\nShakespeare borrowed the story from several tales in Holinshed's Chronicles, a popular history of the British Isles well known to Shakespeare and his contemporaries. In Chronicles, a man named Donwald finds several of his family put to death by his king, Duff, for dealing with witches. After being pressured by his wife, he and four of his servants kill the king in his own house. In Chronicles, Macbeth is portrayed as struggling to support the kingdom in the face of King Duncan's ineptitude. He and Banquo meet the three witches, who make exactly the same prophecies as in Shakespeare's version. Macbeth and Banquo then together plot the murder of Duncan, at Lady Macbeth's urging. Macbeth has a long, ten-year reign before eventually being overthrown by Macduff and Malcolm. The parallels between the two versions are clear. However, some scholars think that George Buchanan's Rerum Scoticarum Historia matches Shakespeare's version more closely. Buchanan's work was available in Latin in Shakespeare's day.\nNo medieval account of the reign of Macbeth mentions the Weird Sisters, Banquo, or Lady Macbeth, and with the exception of the latter none actually existed. The characters of Banquo, the Weird Sisters, and Lady Macbeth were first mentioned in 1527 by a Scottish historian Hector Boece in his book Historia Gentis Scotorum (History of the Scottish People) who wanted to denigrate Macbeth in order to strengthen the claim of the House of Stewart to the Scottish throne. Boece portrayed Banquo as an ancestor of the Stewart kings of Scotland, adding in a \"prophecy\" that the descendants of Banquo would be the rightful kings of Scotland while the Weird Sisters served to give a picture of King Macbeth as gaining the throne via dark supernatural forces. Macbeth did have a wife, but it is not clear if she was as power-hungry and ambitious as Boece portrayed her, which served his purpose of having even Macbeth realise he lacked a proper claim to the throne, and only took it at the urging of his wife. Holinshed accepted Boece's version of Macbeth's reign at face value and included it in his Chronicles. Shakespeare saw the dramatic possibilities in the story as related by Holinshed, and used it as the basis for the play.\nNo other version of the story has Macbeth kill the king in Macbeth's own castle. Scholars have seen this change of Shakespeare's as adding to the darkness of Macbeth's crime as the worst violation of hospitality. Versions of the story that were common at the time had Duncan being killed in an ambush at Inverness, not in a castle. Shakespeare conflated the story of Donwald and King Duff in what was a significant change to the story.\nShakespeare made another important change. In Chronicles, Banquo is an accomplice in Macbeth's murder of King Duncan, and plays an important part in ensuring that Macbeth, not Malcolm, takes the throne in the coup that follows. In Shakespeare's day, Banquo was thought to be an ancestor of the Stuart King James I. (In the 19th century it was established that Banquo is an unhistorical character; the Stuarts are actually descended from a Breton family which migrated to Scotland slightly later than Macbeth's time.) The Banquo portrayed in earlier sources is significantly different from the Banquo created by Shakespeare. Critics have proposed several reasons for this change. First, to portray the king's ancestor as a murderer would have been risky. Other authors of the time who wrote about Banquo, such as Jean de Schelandre in his Stuartide, also changed history by portraying Banquo as a noble man, not a murderer, probably for the same reasons. Second, Shakespeare may have altered Banquo's character simply because there was no dramatic need for another accomplice to the murder; there was, however, a need to give a dramatic contrast to Macbeth\u2014a role which many scholars argue is filled by Banquo.\nOther scholars maintain that a strong argument can be made for associating the tragedy with the Gunpowder Plot of 1605. As presented by Harold Bloom in 2008: \"[S]cholars cite the existence of several topical references in Macbeth to the events of that year, namely the execution of the Father Henry Garnet for his alleged complicity in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605, as referenced in the porter's scene.\" Those arrested for their role in the Gunpowder Plot refused to give direct answers to the questions posed to them by their interrogators, which reflected the influence of the Jesuit practice of equivocation. Shakespeare, by having Macbeth say that demons \"palter...in a double sense\" and \"keep the promise to our ear\/And break it to our hope\", confirmed James's belief that equivocation was a \"wicked\" practice, which reflected in turn the \"wickedness\" of the Catholic Church. Garnet had in his possession A Treatise on Equivocation, and in the play the Weird Sisters often engage in equivocation, for instance telling Macbeth that he could never be overthrown until \"Great Birnan wood to high Dunsinane hill\/Shall Come\". Macbeth interprets the prophecy as meaning never, but in fact, the Three Sisters refer only to branches of the trees of Great Birnam coming to Dunsinane hill. The inspiration for this prophecy may have originated with the Battle of Droizy; both that battle and Macbeth may have, in turn, inspired J. R. R. Tolkien's tree herders, the Ents in his novels The Lord of the Rings.\n\nDate and text\nMacbeth cannot be dated precisely, but it is usually taken to be contemporaneous to the other canonical tragedies: Hamlet, Othello, and King Lear. While some scholars have placed the original writing of the play as early as 1599, most believe that the play is unlikely to have been composed earlier than 1603 as the play is widely seen to celebrate King James' ancestors and the Stuart accession to the throne in 1603 (James believed himself to be descended from Banquo), suggesting that the parade of eight kings\u2014which the witches show Macbeth in a vision in Act IV\u2014is a compliment to King James. Many scholars think the play was written in 1606 in the aftermath of the Gunpowder Plot, citing possible internal allusions to the 1605 plot and its ensuing trials. In fact, there are a great number of allusions and possible pieces of evidence alluding to the Plot, and, for this reason, a great many critics agree that Macbeth was written in the year 1606. Lady Macbeth's instructions to her husband, \"Look like the innocent flower, but be the serpent under't\" (1.5.74\u201375), may be an allusion to a medal that was struck in 1605 to commemorate King James' escape that depicted a serpent hiding among lilies and roses.\nParticularly, the Porter's speech (2.3.1\u201321) in which he welcomes an \"equivocator\", a farmer, and a tailor to hell (2.3.8\u201313), has been argued to be an allusion to the 28 March 1606 trial and execution on 3 May 1606 of the Jesuit Henry Garnet, who used the alias \"Farmer\", with \"equivocator\" referring to Garnet's defence of \"equivocation\". The porter says that the equivocator \"committed treason enough for God's sake\" (2.3.9\u201310), which specifically connects equivocation and treason and ties it to the Jesuit belief that equivocation was only lawful when used \"for God's sake\", strengthening the allusion to Garnet. The porter goes on to say that the equivocator \"yet could not equivocate to heaven\" (2.3.10\u201311), echoing grim jokes that were current on the eve of Garnet's execution: i.e. that Garnet would be \"hanged without equivocation\" and at his execution he was asked \"not to equivocate with his last breath\". The \"English tailor\" the porter admits to hell (2.3.13), has been seen as an allusion to Hugh Griffin, a tailor who was questioned by the Archbishop of Canterbury on 27 November and 3 December 1607 for the part he played in Garnet's \"miraculous straw\", an infamous head of straw that was stained with Garnet's blood that had congealed into a form resembling Garnet's portrait, which was hailed by Catholics as a miracle. The tailor Griffin became notorious and the subject of verses published with his portrait on the title page.\nWhen James became king of England, a feeling of uncertainty settled over the nation. James was a Scottish king and the son of Mary, Queen of Scots, a staunch Catholic and English traitor. In the words of critic Robert Crawford, \"Macbeth was a play for a post-Elizabethan England facing up to what it might mean to have a Scottish king. England seems comparatively benign, while its northern neighbour is mired in a bloody, monarch-killing past. ... Macbeth may have been set in medieval Scotland, but it was filled with material of interest to England and England's ruler.\" Critics argue that the content of the play is clearly a message to James, the new Scottish King of England. Likewise, the critic Andrew Hadfield noted the contrast the play draws between the saintly King Edward the Confessor of England who has the power of the royal touch to cure scrofula and whose realm is portrayed as peaceful and prosperous vs. the bloody chaos of Scotland. James in his 1598 book The Trew Law of Free Monarchies had asserted that kings are always right, if not just, and his subjects owe him total loyalty at all times, writing that even if a king is a tyrant, his subjects must never rebel and just endure his tyranny for their own good. James had argued that the tyranny was preferable to the problems caused by rebellion which were even worse; Shakespeare by contrast in Macbeth argued for the right of the subjects to overthrow a tyrant king, in what appeared to be an implied criticism of James's theories if applied to England. Hadfield also noted a curious aspect of the play in that it implies that primogeniture is the norm in Scotland, but Duncan has to nominate his son Malcolm to be his successor while Macbeth is accepted without protest by the Scottish lairds as their king despite being an usurper. Hadfield argued this aspect of the play with the thanes apparently choosing their king was a reference to the Stuart claim to the English throne, and the attempts of the English Parliament to block the succession of James's Catholic mother, Mary, Queen of Scots, from succeeding to the English throne. Hadfield argued that Shakespeare implied that James was indeed the rightful king of England, but owed his throne not to divine favour as James would have it, but rather due to the willingness of the English Parliament to accept the Protestant son of the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots, as their king.\nGarry Wills provides further evidence that Macbeth is a Gunpowder Play (a type of play that emerged immediately following the events of the Gunpowder Plot). He points out that every Gunpowder Play contains \"a necromancy scene, regicide attempted or completed, references to equivocation, scenes that test loyalty by use of deceptive language, and a character who sees through plots\u2014along with a vocabulary similar to the Plot in its immediate aftermath (words like train, blow, vault) and an ironic recoil of the Plot upon the Plotters (who fall into the pit they dug).\"\nThe play utilizes a few key words that the audience at the time would recognize as allusions to the Plot. In one sermon in 1605, Lancelot Andrewes stated, regarding the failure of the Plotters on God's day, \"Be they fair or foul, glad or sad (as the poet calleth Him) the great Diespiter, 'the Father of days' hath made them both.\" Shakespeare begins the play by using the words \"fair\" and \"foul\" in the first speeches of the witches and Macbeth. In the words of Jonathan Gil Harris, the play expresses the \"horror unleashed by a supposedly loyal subject who seeks to kill a king and the treasonous role of equivocation. The play even echoes certain keywords from the scandal\u2014the 'vault' beneath the House of Parliament in which Guy Fawkes stored thirty kegs of gunpowder and the 'blow' about which one of the conspirators had secretly warned a relative who planned to attend the House of Parliament on 5 November...Even though the Plot is never alluded to directly, its presence is everywhere in the play, like a pervasive odor.\"\n\nScholars also cite an entertainment seen by King James at Oxford in the summer of 1605 that featured three \"sibyls\" like the weird sisters; Kermode surmises that Shakespeare could have heard about this and alluded to it with the weird sisters. However, A. R. Braunmuller in the New Cambridge edition finds the 1605\u201306 arguments inconclusive, and argues only for an earliest date of 1603.\nOne suggested allusion supporting a date in late 1606 is the first witch's dialogue about a sailor's wife: \"'Aroint thee, witch!' the rump-fed ronyon cries.\/Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger\" (1.3.6\u20137). This has been thought to allude to the Tiger, a ship that returned to England 27 June 1606 after a disastrous voyage in which many of the crew were killed by pirates. A few lines later the witch speaks of the sailor, \"He shall live a man forbid:\/Weary se'nnights nine times nine\" (1.3.21\u201322). The real ship was at sea 567 days, the product of 7x9x9, which has been taken as a confirmation of the allusion, which if correct, confirms that the witch scenes were either written or amended later than July 1606.\nThe play is not considered to have been written any later than 1607, since, as Kermode notes, there are \"fairly clear allusions to the play in 1607\". One notable reference is in Francis Beaumont's Knight of the Burning Pestle, first performed in 1607. The following lines (Act V, Scene 1, 24\u201330) are, according to scholars, a clear allusion to the scene in which Banquo's ghost haunts Macbeth at the dinner table:\n\nMacbeth was first printed in the First Folio of 1623 and the Folio is the only source for the text. Some scholars contend that the Folio text was abridged and rearranged from an earlier manuscript or prompt book. Often cited as interpolation are stage cues for two songs, whose lyrics are not included in the Folio but are included in Thomas Middleton's play The Witch, which was written between the accepted date for Macbeth (1606) and the printing of the Folio. Many scholars believe these songs were editorially inserted into the Folio, though whether they were Middleton's songs or preexisting songs is not certain. It is also widely believed that the character of Hecate, as well as some lines of the First Witch (4.1 124\u2013131), were not part of Shakespeare's original play but were added by the Folio editors and possibly written by Middleton, though \"there is no completely objective proof\" of such interpolation.\n\nThemes and motifs\nMacbeth is an anomaly among Shakespeare's tragedies in certain critical ways. It is short: more than a thousand lines shorter than Othello and King Lear, and only slightly more than half as long as Hamlet. This brevity has suggested to many critics that the received version is based on a heavily cut source, perhaps a prompt-book for a particular performance. This would reflect other Shakespeare plays existing in both Quarto and the Folio, where the Quarto versions are usually longer than the Folio versions. Macbeth was first printed in the First Folio, but has no Quarto version \u2013 if there were a Quarto, it would probably be longer than the Folio version. That brevity has also been connected to other unusual features: the fast pace of the first act, which has seemed to be \"stripped for action\"; and the comparative flatness of the characters other than Macbeth. A. C. Bradley, in considering this question, concluded the play \"always was an extremely short one\", noting the witch scenes and battle scenes would have taken up some time in performance, remarking, \"I do not think that, in reading, we feel Macbeth to be short: certainly we are astonished when we hear it is about half as long as Hamlet. Perhaps in the Shakespearean theatre too it seemed to occupy a longer time than the clock recorded.\"\n\nAs a tragedy of character\nAt least since the days of Samuel Johnson, analysis of the play has centred on the question of Macbeth's ambition, commonly seen as so dominant a trait that it defines the character. Johnson asserted that Macbeth, though esteemed for his military bravery, is wholly reviled.\nThis opinion recurs in critical literature, and, according to Caroline Spurgeon, is supported by Shakespeare himself, who apparently intended to degrade his hero by vesting him with clothes unsuited to him and to make Macbeth look ridiculous by several exaggerations he applies: his garments seem either too big or too small for him \u2013 as his ambition is too big and his character too small for his new and unrightful role as king. After Macbeth is unexpectedly greeted with his new title as Thane of Cawdor as prophesied by the witches, Banquo comments:\n\nAnd, at the end, when the tyrant is at bay at Dunsinane, Caithness sees him as a man trying in vain to fasten a large garment on him with too small a belt:\n\nwhile Angus sums up what everybody thinks ever since Macbeth's accession to power:\n\nLike Richard III, but without that character's perversely appealing exuberance, Macbeth wades through blood until his inevitable fall. As Kenneth Muir writes, \"Macbeth has not a predisposition to murder; he has merely an inordinate ambition that makes murder itself seem to be a lesser evil than failure to achieve the crown.\" Some critics, such as E. E. Stoll, explain this characterisation as a holdover from Senecan or medieval tradition. Shakespeare's audience, in this view, expected villains to be wholly bad, and Senecan style, far from prohibiting a villainous protagonist, all but demanded it.\nYet for other critics, it has not been so easy to resolve the question of Macbeth's motivation. Robert Bridges, for instance, perceived a paradox: a character able to express such convincing horror before Duncan's murder would likely be incapable of committing the crime. For many critics, Macbeth's motivations in the first act appear vague and insufficient. John Dover Wilson hypothesised that Shakespeare's original text had an extra scene or scenes where husband and wife discussed their plans. This interpretation is not fully provable; however, the motivating role of ambition for Macbeth is universally recognised. The evil actions motivated by his ambition seem to trap him in a cycle of increasing evil, as Macbeth himself recognises:\n\nWhile working on Russian translations of Shakespeare's works, Boris Pasternak compared Macbeth to Raskolnikov, the protagonist of Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky. Pasternak argues that \"neither Macbeth or Raskolnikov is a born criminal or a villain by nature. They are turned into criminals by faulty rationalizations, by deductions from false premises.\" He goes on to argue that Lady Macbeth is \"feminine ... one of those active, insistent wives\" who becomes her husband's \"executive, more resolute and consistent than he is himself\". According to Pasternak, she is only helping Macbeth carry out his own wishes, to her own detriment.\n\nAs a tragedy of moral order\nThe disastrous consequences of Macbeth's ambition are not limited to him. Almost from the moment of the murder, the play depicts Scotland as a land shaken by inversions of the natural order. Shakespeare may have intended a reference to the great chain of being, although the play's images of disorder are mostly not specific enough to support detailed intellectual readings. He may also have intended an elaborate compliment to James's belief in the divine right of kings, although this hypothesis, outlined at greatest length by Henry N. Paul, is not universally accepted. As in Julius Caesar, though, perturbations in the political sphere are echoed and even amplified by events in the material world. Among the most often depicted of the inversions of the natural order is sleep. Macbeth's announcement that he has \"murdered sleep\" is figuratively mirrored in Lady Macbeth's sleepwalking.\nMacbeth's generally accepted indebtedness to medieval tragedy is often seen as significant in the play's treatment of moral order. Glynne Wickham connects the play, through the Porter, to a mystery play on the harrowing of hell. Howard Felperin argues that the play has a more complex attitude toward \"orthodox Christian tragedy\" than is often admitted; he sees a kinship between the play and the tyrant plays within the medieval liturgical drama.\nThe theme of androgyny is often seen as a special aspect of the theme of disorder. Inversion of normative gender roles is most famously associated with the witches and with Lady Macbeth as she appears in the first act. Whatever Shakespeare's degree of sympathy with such inversions, the play ends with a thorough return to normative gender values. Some feminist psychoanalytic critics, such as Janet Adelman, have connected the play's treatment of gender roles to its larger theme of inverted natural order. In this light, Macbeth is punished for his violation of the moral order by being removed from the cycles of nature (which are figured as female); nature itself (as embodied in the movement of Birnam Wood) is part of the restoration of moral order.\n\nAs a poetic tragedy\nCritics in the early twentieth century reacted against what they saw as an excessive dependence on the study of character in criticism of the play. This dependence, though most closely associated with A. C. Bradley, is clear as early as the time of Mary Cowden Clarke, who offered precise, if fanciful, accounts of the predramatic lives of Shakespeare's female leads. She suggested, for instance, that the child Lady Macbeth refers to in the first act died during a foolish military action.\n\nWitchcraft and evil\nIn the play, the Three Witches represent darkness, chaos, and conflict, while their role is as agents and witnesses. Their presence communicates treason and impending doom. During Shakespeare's day, witches were seen as worse than rebels, \"the most notorious traytor and rebell that can be\". They were not only political traitors, but spiritual traitors as well. Much of the confusion that springs from them comes from their ability to straddle the play's borders between reality and the supernatural. They are so deeply entrenched in both worlds that it is unclear whether they control fate, or whether they are merely its agents. They defy logic, not being subject to the rules of the real world. The witches' lines in the first act: \"Fair is foul, and foul is fair: Hover through the fog and filthy air\" are often said to set the tone for the rest of the play by establishing a sense of confusion. Indeed, the play is filled with situations where evil is depicted as good, while good is rendered evil. The line \"Double, double toil and trouble,\" communicates the witches' intent clearly: they seek only trouble for the mortals around them. The witches' spells are remarkably similar to the spells of the witch Medusa in Anthony Munday's play Fidele and Fortunio published in 1584, and Shakespeare may have been influenced by these.\nWhile the witches do not tell Macbeth directly to kill King Duncan, they use a subtle form of temptation when they tell Macbeth that he is destined to be king. By placing this thought in his mind, they effectively guide him on the path to his own destruction. This follows the pattern of temptation used at the time of Shakespeare. First, they argued, a thought is put in a man's mind, then the person may either indulge in the thought or reject it. Macbeth indulges in it, while Banquo rejects.\nAccording to J. A. Bryant Jr., Macbeth also makes use of Biblical parallels, notably between King Duncan's murder and the murder of Christ:\n\nNo matter how one looks at it, whether as history or as tragedy, Macbeth is distinctively Christian. One may simply count the Biblical allusions as Richmond Noble has done; one may go further and study the parallels between Shakespeare's story and the Old Testament stories of Saul and Jezebel as Miss Jane H. Jack has done; or one may examine with W. C. Curry the progressive degeneration of Macbeth from the point of view of medieval theology.\n\nSuperstition and \"The Scottish Play\"\nWhile many today would say that any misfortune surrounding a production is mere coincidence, actors and others in the theatre industry often consider it bad luck to mention Macbeth by name while inside a theatre, and sometimes refer to it indirectly, for example as \"The Scottish Play\", or \"MacBee\", or when referring to the characters and not the play, \"Mr. and Mrs. M\", or \"The Scottish King\".\nThis is because Shakespeare (or the play's revisers) is said to have used the spells of real witches in his text, purportedly angering the witches and causing them to curse the play. Thus, to say the name of the play inside a theatre is believed to doom the production to failure, and perhaps cause physical injury or death to cast members. There are stories of accidents, misfortunes and even deaths taking place during runs of Macbeth.\nAccording to the actor Sir Donald Sinden, in his Sky Arts TV series Great West End Theatres\n\nContrary to popular myth, Shakespeare's tragedy Macbeth is not the unluckiest play as superstition likes to portray it. Exactly the opposite! The origin of the unfortunate moniker dates back to repertory theatre days when each town and village had at least one theatre to entertain the public. If a play was not doing well, it would invariably get 'pulled' and replaced with a sure-fire audience pleaser \u2013 Macbeth guaranteed full-houses. So when the weekly theatre newspaper, The Stage was published, listing what was on in each theatre in the country, it was instantly noticed what shows had not worked the previous week, as they had been replaced by a definite crowd-pleaser. More actors have died during performances of Hamlet than in the \"Scottish play\" as the profession still calls it. It is forbidden to quote from it backstage as this could cause the current play to collapse and have to be replaced, causing possible unemployment.\nSeveral methods exist to dispel the curse, depending on the actor. One, attributed to Michael York, is to immediately leave the building the stage is in with the person who uttered the name, walk around it three times, spit over their left shoulders, say an obscenity then wait to be invited back into the building. A related practice is to spin around three times as fast as possible on the spot, sometimes accompanied by spitting over their shoulder, and uttering an obscenity. Another popular \"ritual\" is to leave the room, knock three times, be invited in, and then quote a line from Hamlet. Yet another is to recite lines from The Merchant of Venice, thought to be a lucky play.\nSir Patrick Stewart, on the radio program Ask Me Another, asserted \"if you have played the role of the Scottish thane, then you are allowed to say the title, any time anywhere\".\n\nPerformance history\nShakespeare's day to the Interregnum\nThe only eyewitness account of Macbeth in Shakespeare's lifetime was recorded by Simon Forman, who saw a performance at the Globe on 20 April 1610. Scholars have noted discrepancies between Forman's account and the play as it appears in the Folio. For example, he makes no mention of the apparition scene, or of Hecate, of the man not of woman born, or of Birnam Wood. However, Clark observes that Forman's accounts were often inaccurate and incomplete (for instance omitting the statue scene from The Winter's Tale) and his interest did not seem to be in \"giving full accounts of the productions\".\nAs mentioned above, the Folio text is thought by some to be an alteration of the original play. This has led to the theory that the play as we know it from the Folio was an adaptation for indoor performance at the Blackfriars Theatre (which was operated by the King's Men from 1608) \u2013 and even speculation that it represents a specific performance before King James. The play contains more musical cues than any other play in the canon as well as a significant use of sound effects.\n\nRestoration and eighteenth century\nAll theatres were closed down by the Puritan government on 6 September 1642. Upon the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, two patent companies (the King's Company and the Duke's Company) were established, and the existing theatrical repertoire divided between them. Sir William Davenant, founder of the Duke's Company, adapted Shakespeare's play to the tastes of the new era, and his version would dominate on stage for around eighty years. Among the changes he made were the expansion of the role of the witches, introducing new songs, dances and 'flying', and the expansion of the role of Lady Macduff as a foil to Lady Macbeth. There were, however, performances outside the patent companies: among the evasions of the Duke's Company's monopoly was a puppet version of Macbeth.\nMacbeth was a favourite of the seventeenth-century diarist Samuel Pepys, who saw the play on 5 November 1664 (\"admirably acted\"), 28 December 1666 (\"most excellently acted\"), ten days later on 7 January 1667 (\"though I saw it lately, yet [it] appears a most excellent play in all respects\"), on 19 April 1667 (\"one of the best plays for a stage ... that ever I saw\"), again on 16 October 1667 (\"was vexed to see Young, who is but a bad actor at best, act Macbeth in the room of Betterton, who, poor man! is sick\"), and again three weeks later on 6 November 1667 (\"[at] Macbeth, which we still like mightily\"), yet again on 12 August 1668 (\"saw Macbeth, to our great content\"), and finally on 21 December 1668, on which date the king and court were also present in the audience.\nThe first professional performances of Macbeth in North America were probably those of The Hallam Company.\nIn 1744, David Garrick revived the play, abandoning Davenant's version and instead advertising it \"as written by Shakespeare\". In fact this claim was largely false: he retained much of Davenant's more popular business for the witches, and himself wrote a lengthy death speech for Macbeth. And he cut more than 10% of Shakespeare's play, including the drunken porter, the murder of Lady Macduff's son, and Malcolm's testing of Macduff. Hannah Pritchard was his greatest stage partner, having her premiere as his Lady Macbeth in 1747. He would later drop the play from his repertoire upon her retirement from the stage. Mrs. Pritchard was the first actress to achieve acclaim in the role of Lady Macbeth \u2013 at least partly due to the removal of Davenant's material, which made irrelevant moral contrasts with Lady Macduff. Garrick's portrayal focused on the inner life of the character, endowing him with an innocence vacillating between good and evil, and betrayed by outside influences. He portrayed a man capable of observing himself, as if a part of him remained untouched by what he had done, the play moulding him into a man of sensibility, rather than him descending into a tyrant.\nJohn Philip Kemble first played Macbeth in 1778. Although usually regarded as the antithesis of Garrick, Kemble nevertheless refined aspects of Garrick's portrayal into his own. However it was the \"towering and majestic\" Sarah Siddons (Kemble's sister) who became a legend in the role of Lady Macbeth. In contrast to Hannah Pritchard's savage, demonic portrayal, Siddons' Lady Macbeth, while terrifying, was nevertheless \u2013 in the scenes in which she expresses her regret and remorse \u2013 tenderly human. And in portraying her actions as done out of love for her husband, Siddons deflected from him some of the moral responsibility for the play's carnage. Audiences seem to have found the sleepwalking scene particularly mesmerising: Hazlitt said of it that \"all her gestures were involuntary and mechanical ... She glided on and off the stage almost like an apparition.\"\nIn 1794, Kemble dispensed with the ghost of Banquo altogether, allowing the audience to see Macbeth's reaction as his wife and guests see it, and relying upon the fact that the play was so well known that his audience would already be aware that a ghost enters at that point.\nFerdinand Fleck, notable as the first German actor to present Shakespeare's tragic roles in their fullness, played Macbeth at the Berlin National Theatre from 1787. Unlike his English counterparts, he portrayed the character as achieving his stature after the murder of Duncan, growing in presence and confidence: thereby enabling stark contrasts, such as in the banquet scene, which he ended babbling like a child.\n\nNineteenth century\nPerformances outside the patent theatres were instrumental in bringing the monopoly to an end. Robert Elliston, for example, produced a popular adaptation of Macbeth in 1809 at the Royal Circus described in its publicity as \"this matchless piece of pantomimic and choral performance\", which circumvented the illegality of speaking Shakespeare's words through mimed action, singing, and doggerel verse written by J. C. Cross.\n\nIn 1809, in an unsuccessful attempt to take Covent Garden upmarket, Kemble installed private boxes, increasing admission prices to pay for the improvements. The inaugural run at the newly renovated theatre was Macbeth, which was disrupted for over two months with cries of \"Old prices!\" and \"No private boxes!\" until Kemble capitulated to the protestors' demands.\nEdmund Kean at Drury Lane gave a psychological portrayal of the central character, with a common touch, but was ultimately unsuccessful in the role. However he did pave the way for the most acclaimed performance of the nineteenth century, that of William Charles Macready. Macready played the role over a 30-year period, firstly at Covent Garden in 1820 and finally in his retirement performance. Although his playing evolved over the years, it was noted throughout for the tension between the idealistic aspects and the weaker, venal aspects of Macbeth's character. His staging was full of spectacle, including several elaborate royal processions.\nIn 1843 the Theatres Regulation Act finally brought the patent companies' monopoly to an end. From that time until the end of the Victorian era, London theatre was dominated by the actor-managers, and the style of presentation was \"pictorial\" \u2013 proscenium stages filled with spectacular stage-pictures, often featuring complex scenery, large casts in elaborate costumes, and frequent use of tableaux vivant. Charles Kean (son of Edmund), at London's Princess's Theatre from 1850 to 1859, took an antiquarian view of Shakespeare performance, setting his Macbeth in a historically accurate eleventh-century Scotland. His leading lady, Ellen Tree, created a sense of the character's inner life: The Times' critic saying \"The countenance which she assumed ... when luring on Macbeth in his course of crime, was actually appalling in intensity, as if it denoted a hunger after guilt.\" At the same time, special effects were becoming popular: for example in Samuel Phelps' Macbeth the witches performed behind green gauze, enabling them to appear and disappear using stage lighting.\nIn 1849, rival performances of the play sparked the Astor Place riot in Manhattan. The popular American actor Edwin Forrest, whose Macbeth was said to be like \"the ferocious chief of a barbarous tribe\" played the central role at the Broadway Theatre to popular acclaim, while the \"cerebral and patrician\" English actor Macready, playing the same role at the Astor Place Opera House, suffered constant heckling. The existing enmity between the two men (Forrest had openly hissed Macready at a recent performance of Hamlet in Britain) was taken up by Forrest's supporters \u2013 formed from the working class and lower middle class and anti-British agitators, keen to attack the upper-class pro-British patrons of the Opera House and the colonially-minded Macready. Nevertheless, Macready performed the role again three days later to a packed house while an angry mob gathered outside. The militia tasked with controlling the situation fired into the mob. In total, 31 rioters were killed and over 100 injured.\nCharlotte Cushman is unique among nineteenth century interpreters of Shakespeare in achieving stardom in roles of both genders. Her New York debut was as Lady Macbeth in 1836, and she would later be admired in London in the same role in the mid-1840s. Helen Faucit was considered the embodiment of early-Victorian notions of femininity. But for this reason she largely failed when she eventually played Lady Macbeth in 1864: her serious attempt to embody the coarser aspects of Lady Macbeth's character jarred harshly with her public image. Adelaide Ristori, the great Italian actress, brought her Lady Macbeth to London in 1863 in Italian, and again in 1873 in an English translation cut in such a way as to be, in effect, Lady Macbeth's tragedy.\n\nHenry Irving was the most successful of the late-Victorian actor-managers, but his Macbeth failed to curry favour with audiences. His desire for psychological credibility reduced certain aspects of the role: He described Macbeth as a brave soldier but a moral coward, and played him untroubled by conscience \u2013 clearly already contemplating the murder of Duncan before his encounter with the witches. Irving's leading lady was Ellen Terry, but her Lady Macbeth was unsuccessful with the public, for whom a century of performances influenced by Sarah Siddons had created expectations at odds with Terry's conception of the role.\nLate nineteenth-century European Macbeths aimed for heroic stature, but at the expense of subtlety: Tommaso Salvini in Italy and Adalbert Matkowsky in Germany were said to inspire awe, but elicited little pity.\n\n20th century to present\nTwo developments changed the nature of Macbeth performance in the 20th century: first, developments in the craft of acting itself, especially the ideas of Stanislavski and Brecht; and second, the rise of the dictator as a political icon. The latter has not always assisted the performance: it is difficult to sympathise with a Macbeth based on Hitler, Stalin, or Idi Amin.\nBarry Jackson, at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre in 1923, was the first of the 20th-century directors to costume Macbeth in modern dress.\n\nIn 1936, a decade before his film adaptation of the play, Orson Welles directed Macbeth for the Negro Theatre Unit of the Federal Theatre Project at the Lafayette Theatre in Harlem, using black actors and setting the action in Haiti: with drums and Voodoo rites to establish the Witches scenes. The production, dubbed The Voodoo Macbeth, proved inflammatory in the aftermath of the Harlem riots, accused of making fun of black culture and as \"a campaign to burlesque negroes\" until Welles persuaded crowds that his use of black actors and voodoo made important cultural statements.\n\nA performance which is frequently referenced as an example of the play's curse was the outdoor production directed by Burgess Meredith in 1953 in the British colony of Bermuda, starring Charlton Heston. Using the imposing spectacle of Fort St. Catherine as a key element of the set, the production was plagued by a host of mishaps, including Charlton Heston being burned when his tights caught fire.\nSome critics contend there were three great Macbeths on the English-speaking stage in the 20th century, all of them commencing at Stratford-upon-Avon: Laurence Olivier in 1955, Ian McKellen in 1976 and Antony Sher in 1999. Olivier's portrayal (directed by Glen Byam Shaw, with Vivien Leigh as Lady Macbeth) was immediately hailed as a masterpiece. Kenneth Tynan said it succeeded because Olivier built the role to a climax at the end of the play, whereas most actors spend all they have in the first two acts.\nThe play caused difficulties for the Royal Shakespeare Company, especially at the (then) Shakespeare Memorial Theatre. Peter Hall's 1967 production was (in Michael Billington's words) \"an acknowledged disaster\" with the use of real leaves from Birnham Wood getting first-night laughs, and Trevor Nunn's 1974 production was (Billington again) \"an over-elaborate religious spectacle\".\nBut Nunn achieved success for the RSC in his 1976 production at the intimate Other Place, with Ian McKellen and Judi Dench in the central roles. A small cast worked within a simple circle, and McKellen's Macbeth had nothing noble or likeable about him, being a manipulator in a world of manipulative characters. They were a young couple, physically passionate, \"not monsters but recognisable human beings\", but their relationship atrophied as the action progressed.\nThe RSC again achieved critical success in Gregory Doran's 1999 production at The Swan, with Antony Sher and Harriet Walter in the central roles, once again demonstrating the suitability of the play for smaller venues. Doran's witches spoke their lines to a theatre in absolute darkness, and the opening visual image was the entrance of Macbeth and Banquo in the berets and fatigues of modern warfare, carried on the shoulders of triumphant troops. In contrast to Nunn, Doran presented a world in which king Duncan and his soldiers were ultimately benign and honest, heightening the deviance of Macbeth (who seems genuinely surprised by the witches' prophecies) and Lady Macbeth in plotting to kill the king. The play said little about politics, instead powerfully presenting its central characters' psychological collapse.\nMacbeth returned to the RSC in 2018, when Christopher Eccleston played the title role, with Niamh Cusack as his wife, Lady Macbeth. The play later transferred to the Barbican in London.\nIn Soviet-controlled Prague in 1977, faced with the illegality of working in theatres, Pavel Kohout adapted Macbeth into a 75-minute abridgement for five actors, suitable for \"bringing a show in a suitcase to people's homes\".\nSpectacle was unfashionable in Western theatre throughout the 20th century. In East Asia, however, spectacular productions have achieved great success, including Yukio Ninagawa's 1980 production with Masane Tsukayama as Macbeth, set in the 16th century Japanese Civil War. The same director's tour of London in 1987 was widely praised by critics, even though (like most of their audience) they were unable to understand the significance of Macbeth's gestures, the huge Buddhist altar dominating the set, or the petals falling from the cherry trees.\nXu Xiaozhong's 1980 Central Academy of Drama production in Beijing made every effort to be unpolitical (necessary in the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution): yet audiences still perceived correspondences between the central character (whom the director had actually modelled on Louis Napoleon) and Mao Zedong. Shakespeare has often been adapted to indigenous theatre traditions, for example the Kunju Macbeth of Huang Zuolin performed at the inaugural Chinese Shakespeare Festival of 1986. Similarly, B. V. Karanth's Barnam Vana of 1979 had adapted Macbeth to the Yakshagana tradition of Karnataka, India. In 1997, Lokendra Arambam created Stage of Blood, merging a range of martial arts, dance and gymnastic styles from Manipur, performed in Imphal and in England. The stage was literally a raft on a lake.\nThrone of Blood (\u8718\u86db\u5de3\u57ce Kumonosu-j\u014d, Spider Web Castle) is a 1957 Japanese samurai film co-written and directed by Akira Kurosawa. The film transposes Macbeth from Medieval Scotland to feudal Japan, with stylistic elements drawn from Noh drama. Kurosawa was a fan of the play and planned his own adaptation for several years, postponing it after learning of Orson Welles' Macbeth (1948). The film won two Mainichi Film Awards.\nThe play has been translated and performed in various languages in different parts of the world, and Media Artists was the first to stage its Punjabi adaptation in India. The adaptation by Balram and the play directed by Samuel John have been universally acknowledged as a milestone in Punjabi theatre. The unique attempt involved trained theatre experts and the actors taken from a rural background in Punjab. Punjabi folk music imbued the play with the native ethos as the Scottish setting of Shakespeare's play was transposed into a Punjabi milieu.\nIn 2021, Saoirse Ronan starred in The Tragedy of Macbeth at the Almeida Theatre in London. The following year a revival production opened on Broadway with Daniel Craig and Ruth Negga to middling reviews.\nA new production starring David Tennant and Cush Jumbo ran at London's Donmar Warehouse from 8 December 2023 to 10 February 2024. Max Webster directed the production. The show received 3 Laurence Olivier Award nominations, including Best Revival. It is scheduled to transfer to the Harold Pinter Theatre in the West End from 1 October 2024 for a limited run.\n\nOperas\nMacbeth was adapted into an Italian opera (Macbeth) by composer Giuseppe Verdi and librettist Francesco Maria Piave in 1847 (revised in French in 1865). An English opera adaptation of the play was created by Lawrance Collingwood in 1927.\nContemporary opera adaptations include Luke Styles' Macbeth (2015) and Pascal Dusapin's Macbeth Underworld (2019).\nAn indirect adaptation is Dmitri Shostakovich's Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk (1934), based on the novella of the same name by Nikolai Leskov.\n\nSee also\nCultural references to Macbeth\n\nNotes and references\nReferences\nSources\nEditions of Macbeth\nSecondary sources\nExternal links\n\nMacbeth, eds.

Sakamoto's score won the film a BAFTA Award for Best Film Music.\n\nPlot\nIn 1942, Captain Yonoi is the commander of the POW camp in Lebak Sembada in Japanese-occupied Java. A strict adherent to the bushido code, his only sources of connection to the prisoners lie in the empathetic Lt. Col. John Lawrence, the only inmate fluent in Japanese, and the abrasive spokesman Gp. Capt. Hicksley, who repeatedly resists Yonoi's attempts to find weapons experts among the prisoners for the Japanese army's interests. Lawrence has befriended Sgt. Gengo Hara, but remains at odds with the rest of the staff. Summoned to the military trial of the recently captured Major Jack Celliers, Yonoi is fascinated by his resilience and has him interned at the camp. After the trial, Yonoi confides in Lawrence that he is haunted with shame due to his absence during the February 26 Incident, believing he should have died alongside the rebels and implying that his focus on honour stems from this. Sensing a kindred spirit in Celliers, Yonoi's fascination grows into a romantic obsession: he treats him specially, watches him sleep, and repeatedly asks Hara about him in private.\nWhen the inmates are made to fast as punishment for insubordination during the forced seppuku of a guard (Okura), Celliers sneaks in food. The guards catch him and find a smuggled radio during the subsequent investigation, forcing him and Lawrence to take the blame. Yonoi's batman, realizing the hold Celliers has on him, attempts to kill Celliers in his sleep that night, but fails after he wakes up and escapes, freeing Lawrence too. Yonoi catches Celliers and challenges him to a duel in exchange for his freedom, but Celliers refuses; the batman returns and commits suicide for his failure, urging Yonoi to kill Celliers before his feelings overpower him. \nAt the funeral, Lawrence learns that he and Celliers will be executed for the radio, despite the lack of evidence, to preserve order in the camp; enraged, he trashes the funeral altar and is forced back into his cell. That night, Celliers reveals to Lawrence that as a teenager, he betrayed his younger brother, long bullied for his hunchback, by refusing to spare him a humiliating and traumatizing initiation ritual at their boarding school. Confronting his past, he describes the lifelong shame he felt towards his actions, paralleling Yonoi's predicament. During their conversation, the pair are released by a drunken Hara, as a different prisoner confessed to delivering the radio. As they leave, Hara calls out in English, \"Merry Christmas, Lawrence!\" Although Yonoi is angry at Hara for exceeding his authority, he only mildly reprimands him.\nHicksley, realizing that Yonoi wants to replace him with Celliers as spokesman, confronts him. The two argue over their withholding of information from one another before an enraged Yonoi orders the whole camp to form up outside the barracks, including the sick bay's ailing patients, resulting in one's death. Hicksley, who refused to bring out the patients, is to be punished for his insubordination with an on-the-spot execution. Before he can be killed, Celliers breaks rank and kisses Yonoi on each cheek, choosing to save Hicksley's life at the cost of his own. Caught between a desire for vindication and his feelings for Celliers, a distraught Yonoi collapses and is ultimately relieved from duty; the guards beat Celliers and drag him out of the area. His more rigid replacement has Celliers buried in the sand up to his neck and left to die. Before leaving, Yonoi sneaks into his pen and cuts a lock from his hair, moments before his death.\nFour years later, Lawrence visits Hara, who is now a prisoner of the Allies. Hara has learned to speak English and reveals he is to be executed the following day for war crimes. Expressing confusion over the harshness of his sentence given how commonplace his actions were among both sides of the war, he and Lawrence both conclude that while the Allies officially won, morally \"we are all wrong.\" The two reminisce on Celliers and Yonoi, the latter of whom was reported to have been killed after the war, before bidding each other goodbye. As he is leaving, Hara calls out, \"Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence!\".\n\nCast\nDavid Bowie as Maj. Jack \"Strafer\" Celliers\nChris Broun as Jack Celliers (aged 12)\nTom Conti as Lt. Col.

He felt that Bowie had \"an inner spirit that is indestructible\". While shooting the film, Bowie was amazed that \u014cshima had a two- to three-acre camp built on the remote Polynesian island of Rarotonga, but most of the camp was never shot on film. He said \u014cshima \"only shot little bits at the corners. I kind of thought it was a waste, but when I saw the movie, it was just so potent \u2013 you could feel the camp there, quite definitely.\" Bowie noted how \u014cshima would give an incredible amount of direction to his Japanese actors (\"down to the minutest detail\"), but when directing him or fellow Westerner Tom Conti, he would say \"Please do whatever it is you people do.\" Bowie thought his performance in the film was \"the most credible performance\" he had done in a film up to that point in his career.\nThe boarding school sequence was shot on location at King's College, a private high school in Auckland, New Zealand. In a shot of two students playing billiards, another boy in the room can be seen wearing a King's blazer. Other scenes were filmed in various locations around Auckland including Auckland Railway Station.\n\u014cshima chose Ryuichi Sakamoto after seeing his photographs in a photo book Fifty Representative Figures of Today, and without even meeting him. The film was Sakamoto's debut soundtrack just as it was his inaugural acting role. It was also Takeshi \u2018Beat\u2019 Kitano's debut movie acting role, having only been known up to that point as a comedian on TV variety shows in Japan.\nContrary to usual cinematic practice, \u014cshima shot the film without rushes and shipped the film off the island with no safety prints. \"It was all going out of the camera and down to the post office and being wrapped up in brown paper and sent off to Japan\", said Bowie. \u014cshima's editor in Japan cut the movie into a rough print within four days of \u014cshima returning to Japan.\nOn set, David Bowie made a bond with his on-screen brother, James Malcolm, whom he later called his \u201cNew Zealand brother\u201d. For one pivotal scene, Malcolm had to sing for Bowie. The next year, Bowie invited Malcolm to join him on stage at Western Springs in Auckland for the Serious Moonlight tour, where they released a dove together as a sign of peace.\n\nSoundtrack\nReception\nReview aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence an 86% approval rating and an average rating of 6.60 out of 10 based on 28 reviews. The site's consensus states: \"Worthy themes and strong performances across the board make Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence an impactful story about bridging cultural divides.\" Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 53 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\nThe New York Times critic Janet Maslin wrote:\n\nDavid Bowie plays a born leader in Nagisa \u014cshima's Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence, and he plays him like a born film star. Mr. Bowie's screen presence here is mercurial and arresting, and he seems to arrive at this effortlessly, though he manages to do something slyly different in every scene. The demands of his role may sometimes be improbable and elaborate, but Mr. Bowie fills them in a remarkably plain and direct way. Little else in the film is so unaffected or clear.\nOn the film's Japanese actors, Maslin wrote that\n\nthe two main Japanese characters who have brought [Lawrence] to this understanding are Sergeant Hara, a brutal figure who taunts Lawrence while also admiring him, and Captain Yonoi, the handsome young camp commander, who has a fierce belief in the samurai code. Both of these actors perform at an obvious disadvantage, since their English is awkward and the motives of their characters are imperfectly revealed. However, they can convey the complex affinity between captors and prisoners, a point that is made most touchingly in a brief postwar coda.\nDirectors Akira Kurosawa and Christopher Nolan named Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence as among their favorite films.\n\nBox office\nIn Japan, the film earned \u00a5990 million in distributor rentals. In the United States, it grossed $2,306,560 (equivalent to $7,100,000 in 2023).\nIt sold 2,385,100 tickets in the United States, France and Sweden (including 1,579,223 in France). It also sold 423,778 tickets in Germany, and 54 tickets in Switzerland and Spain since 2007, for a combined 2,808,932 tickets sold in overseas territories outside of Japan and the United Kingdom.\n\nSee also\nList of anti-war films\nList of Christmas films\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nMerry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence at IMDb \nMerry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence at the Japanese Movie Database (in Japanese)\nMerry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence at AllMovie\nMerry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence at the TCM Movie Database\nLawrence of Shinjuku: Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence an essay by Chuck Stephens at the Criterion Collection","123":"Michael Sragow (born June 26, 1952 in New York) is a film critic and columnist who has written for the Orange County Register, The Baltimore Sun, Film Comment, The San Francisco Examiner, The New Times, The New Yorker (where he worked with Pauline Kael), The Atlantic and Salon.

He emerged as one of the major figures of the New Hollywood era. He has received many accolades, including an Academy Award, four BAFTA Awards, three Emmy Awards, a Grammy Award, and three Golden Globe Awards. He has been honored with the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1997, the Film Society of Lincoln Center tribute in 1998, the Kennedy Center Honor in 2007, the Cecil B. DeMille Award in 2010, and the BAFTA Fellowship in 2012. Four of his films have been inducted into the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\".\nScorsese received a Master of Arts degree from New York University's Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development in 1968. His directorial debut, Who's That Knocking at My Door (1967), was accepted into the Chicago Film Festival. In the 1970s and 1980s decades, Scorsese's films, much influenced by his Italian-American background and upbringing in New York City, center on macho-posturing men and explore crime, machismo, nihilism, and Catholic concepts of guilt and redemption. His trademark styles include extensive use of slow motion and freeze frames, graphic depictions of extreme violence, and liberal use of profanity. His 1973 crime film Mean Streets was a blueprint for his filmmaking styles.\nScorsese won the Palme d'Or at Cannes with his 1976 psychological thriller Taxi Driver, which starred Robert De Niro, who became associated with Scorsese through eight more films including New York, New York (1977), Raging Bull (1980) The King of Comedy (1982), Goodfellas (1990), and Casino (1995). In the following decades, he garnered box office success with a series of collaborations with Leonardo DiCaprio. These films include Gangs of New York (2002), The Aviator (2004), The Departed (2006), Shutter Island (2010) and The Wolf of Wall Street (2013). He reunited with De Niro with The Irishman (2019) and Killers of the Flower Moon (2023), the latter also featuring DiCaprio. His other films include After Hours (1985), The Color of Money (1986), The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), The Age of Innocence (1993), Kundun (1997), Hugo (2011), and Silence (2016).\nIn addition to film, Scorsese has directed episodes for some television series including the HBO series Boardwalk Empire (2011\u20132015), and Vinyl (2016), as well as the HBO documentary Public Speaking (2010), and the Netflix docu-series Pretend It's a City (2021). He is also known for several rock music documentaries including The Last Waltz (1978), No Direction Home (2005), Shine a Light (2008), and George Harrison: Living in the Material World (2011). An advocate for film preservation and restoration, he founded three nonprofit organizations: The Film Foundation in 1990, the World Cinema Foundation in 2007, and the African Film Heritage Project in 2017.\n\nEarly life and education\nMartin Charles Scorsese was born in the Flushing neighborhood of New York City's Queens borough on November 17, 1942. He grew up in the Little Italy neighborhood of the city's Manhattan borough. Both of his parents, Catherine Scorsese (n\u00e9e Cappa) and Charles Scorsese, worked in the Garment District. Charles was a clothes presser and actor, while Catherine was a seamstress and an actress. All four of Scorsese's grandparents were Italian immigrants from Sicily, hailing from Polizzi Generosa on his father's side and Ciminna on his mother's side. The original surname of the family was Scozzese, meaning \"Scot\" or \"Scottish\" in Italian, and was later changed to Scorsese because of a transcription error.\nScorsese was raised in a predominantly Catholic environment. As a boy, he had asthma and could not play sports or take part in any activities with other children, so his parents and his older brother would often take him to movie theaters; it was at this stage in his life that he developed a passion for cinema. As a teenager in the Bronx, he frequently rented Powell and Pressburger's The Tales of Hoffmann (1951) from a store that had one copy of the reel. He was one of only two people who regularly rented it; the other, George A. Romero, would also become a film director.\nScorsese has named Sabu and Victor Mature as his favorite actors during his youth. He has also spoken of the influence of the 1947\u201348 Powell and Pressburger films Black Narcissus and The Red Shoes, whose innovative techniques later impacted his filmmaking. In his documentary titled A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies, Scorsese said that he was enamored of historical epics in his adolescence, and at least two films of the genre, Land of the Pharaohs and El Cid, appear to have had a deep and lasting impact on his cinematic psyche. Scorsese also developed an admiration for neorealist cinema at this time. He recounted its influence in a documentary on Italian neorealism, and commented on how Bicycle Thieves, Rome, Open City and especially Pais\u00e0 inspired him and influenced his view or portrayal of his Sicilian roots. In his documentary, Il Mio Viaggio in Italia (My Voyage to Italy), Scorsese noted that the Sicilian episode of Roberto Rossellini's Pais\u00e0, which he first saw on television with his relatives who were themselves Sicilian immigrants, had a significant impact on his life. He acknowledges owing a great debt to the French New Wave and has stated that \"the French New Wave has influenced all filmmakers who have worked since, whether they saw the films or not.\" He has also cited the works of Satyajit Ray, Ingmar Bergman, Andrzej Wajda, Michelangelo Antonioni, Federico Fellini, Ishir\u014d Honda, and Eiji Tsuburaya as major influences on his career. Although there was no habit of reading at home, towards the end of the 1950s, Scorsese began to approach literature, being marked in particular by The Heart of the Matter (1948) by Graham Greene, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916) by James Joyce and Notes from Underground by Fyodor Dostoevsky.\nScorsese attended the all-boys Cardinal Hayes High School in the Bronx, graduating in 1960. He had initially desired to become a priest, attending a preparatory seminary but failed after the first year. This gave way to cinema and consequently Scorsese enrolled in NYU's Washington Square College (now known as the College of Arts and Science), where he earned a B.A. in English in 1964. He went on to earn his MA from New York University's School of Education (now the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development) in 1968, a year after the school was founded.\n\nCareer\n1963\u20131972: Short films and feature debut\nWhile attending the Tisch School of the Arts, Scorsese made the short films What's a Nice Girl like You Doing in a Place like This? (1963) and It's Not Just You, Murray! (1964). His most famous short of the period is the darkly comic The Big Shave (1967), which features Peter Bernuth. The film is an indictment of America's involvement in Vietnam, suggested by its alternative title Viet '67. Scorsese has mentioned on several occasions that he was greatly inspired in his early days at New York University by film professor Haig P. Manoogian. Scorsese's first professional job was when he was at NYU he was the assistant cameraman to cinematographer Baird Bryant on the John G. Avildsen directed short film Smiles (1964). Scorsese stated, \"It was really important because they were filming on 35mm\". He stated he was terrible at the job because he could not judge the distance of the focus. He also worked as a gaffer for Albert and David Maysles and as an editor for CBS News, the later of whom offered him a full time position but Scorsese declined due to his pursuit in film.\nIn 1967, Scorsese made his first feature-length film, the black and white I Call First, which was later retitled Who's That Knocking at My Door, with his fellow students actor Harvey Keitel and editor Thelma Schoonmaker, both of whom were to become long-term collaborators. This film was intended to be the first of Scorsese's semi-autobiographical J. R. Trilogy, which would have included a later film, Mean Streets. Film critic Roger Ebert saw the film at the 1967 Chicago International Film Festival and in his review praised Scorsese and the film, writing, \"'I Call First' brings these two kinds of films together into a work that is absolutely genuine, artistically satisfying and technically comparable to the best films being made anywhere. I have no reservations in describing it as a great moment in American movies.\"\nScorsese became friends with the influential \"movie brats\" of the 1970s: Brian De Palma, Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas, and Steven Spielberg. It was De Palma who introduced Scorsese to Robert De Niro. During this period, Scorsese worked as the assistant director and one of the editors on the documentary Woodstock (1970) and met actor\u2013director John Cassavetes, who became a close friend and mentor. In 1972, Scorsese made the Depression-era exploiter Boxcar Bertha for B-movie producer Roger Corman, who also helped directors such as Francis Ford Coppola, James Cameron, and John Sayles launch their careers. It was Corman who taught Scorsese that entertaining films could be shot with very little money or time, preparing the young director well for the challenges to come with Mean Streets. Following the film's release, Cassavetes encouraged Scorsese to make the films that he wanted to make, rather than someone else's projects.\n\n1973\u20131989: Breakthrough and acclaim\nChampioned by influential film critic Pauline Kael, Mean Streets was a breakthrough for Scorsese, De Niro, and Keitel. By now the signature Scorsese style was in place: macho posturing, bloody violence, Catholic guilt and redemption, gritty New York locale (though the majority of Mean Streets was shot in Los Angeles), rapid-fire editing and a soundtrack with contemporary music. Although the film was innovative, its wired atmosphere, edgy documentary style, and gritty street-level direction owed a debt to directors Cassavetes, Samuel Fuller and early Jean-Luc Godard. In 1974, actress Ellen Burstyn chose Scorsese to direct her in Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, for which she won an Academy Award for Best Actress. Although well regarded, the film remains an anomaly in the director's early career as it focuses on a central female character. Returning to Little Italy to explore his ethnic roots, Scorsese next came up with Italianamerican, a documentary featuring his parents Charles and Catherine Scorsese.\nScorsese followed with Taxi Driver in 1976, which depicted a Vietnam veteran who takes the law into his own hands on New York's crime-ridden streets. The film established him as an accomplished filmmaker and also brought attention to cinematographer Michael Chapman, whose style tends towards high contrasts, strong colors, and complex camera movements. The film starred Robert De Niro as the angry and alienated Travis Bickle, and co-starred Jodie Foster in a highly controversial role as an underage prostitute, with Harvey Keitel as her pimp. Taxi Driver also marked the start of a series of collaborations between Scorsese and writer Paul Schrader, whose influences included the diary of would-be assassin Arthur Bremer and Pickpocket, a film by the French director Robert Bresson. Writer\u2013director Schrader often returns to Bresson's work in films such as American Gigolo, Light Sleeper, and Scorsese's later Bringing Out the Dead. Already controversial upon its release, Taxi Driver hit the headlines again five years later, when John Hinckley Jr. made an assassination attempt on then-president Ronald Reagan. He subsequently blamed his act on his obsession with Jodie Foster's Taxi Driver character (in the film, De Niro's character, Travis Bickle, makes an assassination attempt on a senator).\n\nTaxi Driver won the Palme d'Or at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival, also receiving four Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. The critical and financial success of Taxi Driver encouraged Scorsese to move ahead with his first big-budget project: the highly stylized musical New York, New York. This tribute to Scorsese's home town and the classic Hollywood musical was a box-office failure. The film was the director's third collaboration with Robert De Niro, co-starring with Liza Minnelli. The film is best remembered today for the title theme song, which was popularized by Frank Sinatra. Although possessing Scorsese's usual visual panache and stylistic bravura, many critics felt its enclosed studio-bound atmosphere left it leaden in comparison with his earlier work. Despite its weak reception, the film is regarded positively by some critics. Richard Brody in The New Yorker wrote: For Scorsese, a lifelong cinephile, the essence of New York could be found in its depiction in classic Hollywood movies. Remarkably, his backward-looking tribute to the golden age of musicals and noirish romantic melodramas turned out to be one of his most freewheeling and personal films.\nIn 1977, he directed the Broadway musical The Act, starring Liza Minnelli. The disappointing reception that New York, New York received drove Scorsese into depression. By this stage Scorsese had developed a serious cocaine addiction. However, he did find the creative drive to make the highly regarded The Last Waltz, documenting the final concert by The Band. It was held at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco on American Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 1976, and featured one of the most extensive lineups of prominent guest performers at a single concert, including Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Ringo Starr, Muddy Waters, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Paul Butterfield, Neil Diamond, Ronnie Wood, and Eric Clapton. However, Scorsese's commitments to other projects delayed the release of the film until 1978. Another Scorsese-directed documentary, titled American Boy, also appeared in 1978, focusing on Steven Prince, the cocky gun salesman who appeared in Taxi Driver. A period of wild partying followed, damaging the director's already fragile health. Scorsese helped provide footage for the documentary Elvis on Tour.\n\nBy several accounts (Scorsese's included), Robert De Niro saved Scorsese's life when he persuaded him to kick his cocaine addiction to make his highly regarded film Raging Bull. Writing for The New Yorker in March 2000, Mark Singer summarized Scorsese's condition stating: He (Scorsese) was more than mildly depressed. Drug abuse, and abuse of his body in general, culminated in a terrifying episode of internal bleeding. Robert De Niro came to see him in the hospital and asked, in so many words, whether he wanted to live or die. If you want to live, De Niro proposed, let's make this picture\u2014referring to Raging Bull, an as-told-to book by Jake LaMotta, the former world middleweight boxing champion, that De Niro had given him to read years earlier. Convinced that he would never make another movie, he poured his energies into making the violent biopic of middleweight boxing champion Jake LaMotta, calling it a kamikaze method of film-making. The film is widely viewed as a masterpiece and was voted the greatest film of the 1980s by Britain's Sight & Sound magazine. It received eight Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, Best Actor for Robert De Niro, Best Supporting Actress for Cathy Moriarty, Best Supporting Actor for Joe Pesci, and Scorsese's first for Best Director. De Niro won, as did Thelma Schoonmaker for editing, but Best Director went to Robert Redford for Ordinary People. From this work onwards, Scorsese's films are always labeled as \"A Martin Scorsese Picture\" on promotional material. Raging Bull, filmed in high contrast black and white, is where Scorsese's style reached its zenith: Taxi Driver and New York, New York had used elements of expressionism to replicate psychological points of view, but here the style was taken to new extremes, employing extensive slow-motion, complex tracking shots, and extravagant distortion of perspective (for example, the size of boxing rings would change from fight to fight). Thematically too, the concerns carried on from Mean Streets and Taxi Driver: insecure males, violence, guilt, and redemption.\nAlthough the screenplay for Raging Bull was credited to Paul Schrader and Mardik Martin (who earlier co-wrote Mean Streets), the finished script differed extensively from Schrader's original draft. It was rewritten several times by various writers including Jay Cocks (who went on to co-script later Scorsese films The Age of Innocence and Gangs of New York). The final draft was largely written by Scorsese and Robert De Niro. The American Film Institute chose Raging Bull as the number one American sports film on their list of the top 10 sports films. In 1997, the Institute ranked Raging Bull as the twenty-fourth greatest film of all time on their AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies list. In 2007, they ranked Raging Bull as the fourth greatest film of all time on their AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) list.\nScorsese's next project was his fifth collaboration with Robert De Niro, The King of Comedy (1983). It is a satire on the world of media and celebrity, whose central character is a troubled loner who ironically becomes famous through a criminal act (kidnapping). The film was an obvious departure from the more emotionally committed films he had become associated with. Visually, it was far less kinetic than the style Scorsese had developed previously, often using a static camera and long takes. Here the expressionism of his previous work gave way to moments of almost total surrealism. It still bore many of Scorsese's trademarks, however. The King of Comedy failed at the box office, but has become increasingly well regarded by critics in the years since its release. German director Wim Wenders numbered it among his 15 favorite films. Also, in 1983, Scorsese made a brief cameo appearance in the film Anna Pavlova (also known as A Woman for All Time), originally intended to be directed by one of his heroes, Michael Powell. This led to a more significant acting appearance in Bertrand Tavernier's jazz film Round Midnight. He also made a brief venture into television, directing an episode of Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories.\nWith After Hours (1985), for which he won a Best Director Award at Cannes, Scorsese made an esthetic shift back to a pared-down, almost \"underground\" film-making style. Filmed on an extremely low budget, on location, and at night in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan, the film is a black comedy about one increasingly misfortunate night for a mild New York word processor (Griffin Dunne) and features cameos by such disparate actors as Teri Garr and Cheech & Chong. Along with the 1987 Michael Jackson music video \"Bad\", in 1986 Scorsese made The Color of Money, a sequel to the much admired Robert Rossen film The Hustler (1961) with Paul Newman, which co-starred Tom Cruise. Although adhering to Scorsese's established style, The Color of Money was the director's first official foray into mainstream film-making. The film finally won actor Paul Newman an Oscar and gave Scorsese the clout to finally secure backing for a project that had been a longtime goal for him: The Last Temptation of Christ.\nIn 1983, Scorsese began work on this long-cherished personal project. The Last Temptation of Christ, based on the 1955 novel written by Nikos Kazantzakis, retold the life of Christ in human rather than divine terms. Barbara Hershey recalls introducing Scorsese to the book while they were filming Boxcar Bertha. The film was slated to shoot under the Paramount Pictures banner, but shortly before principal photography was to start, Paramount pulled the plug on the project, citing pressure from religious groups. In this aborted 1983 version, Aidan Quinn was cast as Jesus, and Sting was cast as Pontius Pilate. (In the 1988 version, these roles were played by Willem Dafoe and David Bowie respectively.) However, following his mid-1980s flirtation with commercial Hollywood, Scorsese made a major return to personal filmmaking with the project; Universal Pictures agreed to finance the film as Scorsese agreed to make a more mainstream film for the studio in the future (it eventually resulted in Cape Fear). Even prior to its 1988 release, the film (adapted by Taxi Driver and Raging Bull veteran Paul Schrader) caused a massive furor, with worldwide protests against its perceived blasphemy effectively turning a low-budget independent film into a media sensation. Most of the controversy centered on the final passages of the film, which depicted Christ marrying and raising a family with Mary Magdalene in a Satan-induced hallucination while on the cross.\nIn 1986, Scorsese directed the 18-minute short film Bad featuring Michael Jackson and Wesley Snipes (in his film debut). The short also serves as a music video and was shot in the Hoyt\u2013Schermerhorn Streets station in Brooklyn over a 6-week period during November and December 1986. The short film's cinematographer was frequent Scorsese collaborator Michael Chapman. The dancing and filmmaking was heavily influenced by the 1961 film West Side Story. Scorsese also noted the influence of his own film Taxi Driver (1976) in Spike Lee's documentary about the 25th anniversary of the short titled, Bad 25 (2012). The short has been praised by critics as one of the most iconic and greatest videos of all time; Jackson's outfit has been cited as an influence on fashion. That year, he had signed a deal with upstart major The Walt Disney Studios to produce and direct features, following the success of The Color of Money.\nLooking past the controversy, The Last Temptation of Christ gained critical acclaim and remains an important work in Scorsese's canon: an explicit attempt to wrestle with the spirituality underpinning his films up until that point. The director went on to receive his second nomination for a Best Director Academy Award (again unsuccessfully, this time losing to Barry Levinson for Rain Man). As a separate film project, and along with directors Woody Allen and Francis Ford Coppola in 1989, Scorsese provided one of three segments in the portmanteau film New York Stories, called \"Life Lessons\". Roger Ebert's gave the film a mixed review, while praising Scorsese's short as \"really successful\".\n\n1990\u20131999: Established director\nAfter a decade of films considered by critics to be mixed results, some considered Scorsese's gangster epic Goodfellas (1990) his return to directorial form, and his most confident and fully realized film since Raging Bull. De Niro and Joe Pesci offered a virtuoso display of Scorsese's bravura cinematic technique in the film and re-established, enhanced, and consolidated his reputation. After the film was released, Roger Ebert, a friend and supporter of Scorsese, named Goodfellas \"the best mob movie ever\". It is ranked No. 1 on Ebert's movie list for 1990, along with those of Gene Siskel and Peter Travers', and is widely considered one of the director's greatest achievements. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, and Scorsese earned his third Best Director nomination but again lost to a first-time director, Kevin Costner (Dances with Wolves). Joe Pesci earned the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance. Scorsese and the film also won many other awards, including five BAFTA Awards, a Silver Lion and more. The American Film Institute placed Goodfellas at No. 94 on the AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies list. On the 2007 updated version, they moved Goodfellas up to No. 92 on the AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies list (10th Anniversary Edition) and put Goodfellas at No. 2 on their list of the top 10 gangster films (after The Godfather).\nIn 1990, he released his only short-form documentary: Made in Milan about fashion designer Giorgio Armani. The following year brought Cape Fear, a remake of a cult 1962 movie of the same name and the director's seventh collaboration with De Niro. Another foray into the mainstream, the film was a stylized thriller taking its cues heavily from Alfred Hitchcock and Charles Laughton's The Night of the Hunter (1955). Cape Fear received a mixed critical reception and was lambasted in many quarters for its scenes depicting misogynistic violence. However, the lurid subject matter gave Scorsese a chance to experiment with visual tricks and effects. The film garnered two Oscar nominations. Earning $80 million domestically, it stood as Scorsese's most commercially successful release until The Aviator (2004), and then The Departed (2006). The film also marked the first time Scorsese used wide-screen Panavision with an aspect ratio of 2.39:1.\nIn 1990, Scorsese acted in a small role as Vincent van Gogh in the film Dreams by Japanese director Akira Kurosawa. Scorsese's 1994 cameo appearance in the Robert Redford film Quiz Show is remembered for the telling line: \"You see, the audience didn't tune in to watch some amazing display of intellectual ability. They just wanted to watch the money.\" \nIn 1994, Scorsese and producer Barbara De Fina formed the production company \nDe Fina-Cappa. In the early 1990s, Scorsese also expanded his role as a film producer. He produced a wide range of films, including major Hollywood studio productions (Mad Dog and Glory, Clockers), low-budget independent films (The Grifters, Naked in New York, Grace of My Heart, Search and Destroy, The Hi-Lo Country), and even the foreign film (Con gli occhi chiusi (With Closed Eyes)).\n\nThe Age of Innocence (1993) was a significant departure for Scorsese, a period adaptation of the Edith Wharton novel about the constrictive high society of late-19th century New York. It was highly lauded by critics upon its original release but was a box office bomb, making an overall loss. As noted in Scorsese on Scorsese by editor\u2013interviewer Ian Christie, the news that Scorsese wanted to make a film about a failed 19th-century romance raised many eyebrows among the film fraternity; all the more when Scorsese made it clear that it was a personal project and not a studio for-hire job.\nScorsese was interested in doing a \"romantic piece\", and he was strongly drawn to the characters and the story of Wharton's text. Scorsese wanted his film to be as rich an emotional experience as the book was to him rather than the traditional academic adaptations of literary works. To this end, Scorsese sought influence from diverse period films that had had an emotional impact on him. In Scorsese on Scorsese, he documents influences from films such as Luchino Visconti's Senso and his Il Gattopardo (The Leopard) as well as Orson Welles's The Magnificent Ambersons and also Roberto Rossellini's La prise de pouvoir par Louis XIV (The Taking of Power by Louis XIV). Although The Age of Innocence was ultimately different from these films in terms of narrative, story, and thematic concern, the presence of a lost society, of lost values as well as detailed re-creations of social customs and rituals continues the tradition of these films. It came back into the public eye, especially in countries such as the UK and France, but still is largely neglected in North America. The film earned five Academy Award nominations (including Best Adapted Screenplay for Scorsese), winning the Costume Design Oscar. This was his first collaboration with the Academy Award-winning actor Daniel Day-Lewis, with whom he would work again on Gangs of New York. This was Scorsese's first film to be shot on Super 35 format.\nCasino (1995), like The Age of Innocence before it, focused on a tightly wound male whose well-ordered life is disrupted by the arrival of unpredictable forces. The fact that it was a violent gangster film made it more palatable to the director's fans who perhaps were baffled by the apparent departure of the earlier film. Casino was a box office success, and it received generally positive notices from critics. Comparisons were drawn to his earlier film Goodfellas, and Scorsese admitted Casino bore a superficial resemblance to it, but he maintained that the story was significantly larger in scope. Sharon Stone was nominated for the Best Actress Academy Award for her performance. During the filming, Scorsese played a background part as a gambler at one of the tables.\nScorsese still found time for a four-hour documentary in 1995, titled A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies, offering a thorough trek through American cinema. It covered the silent era to 1969, a year after which Scorsese began his feature career. He said, \"I wouldn't feel right commenting on myself or my contemporaries.\" In the four-hour documentary, Scorsese lists the four aspects of the director he believes are the most important as (1) the director as storyteller; (2) the director as an illusionist: D. W. Griffith or F. W. Murnau, who created new editing techniques among other innovations that made the appearance of sound and color possible later on; (3) the director as a smuggler\u2014filmmakers such as Douglas Sirk, Samuel Fuller, and Vincente Minnelli, who used to hide subversive messages in their films; and (4) the director as iconoclast. In the preface to this documentary, Scorsese states his commitment to the \"Director's Dilemma\", in which a successful contemporary director must be pragmatic about the realities of getting financing for films of personal esthetic interest by accepting the need of \"making one film for the studio, and (then) making one for oneself.\"\nIf The Age of Innocence alienated and confused some fans, then Kundun (1997) went several steps further, offering an account of the early life of Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, the People's Liberation Army's entry into Tibet, and the Dalai Lama's subsequent exile to India. Not only a departure in subject matter, Kundun saw Scorsese employing a fresh narrative and visual approach. Traditional dramatic devices were substituted for a trance-like meditation achieved through an elaborate tableau of colorful visual images. The film was a source of turmoil for its distributor, Buena Vista Pictures, which was planning significant expansion into the Chinese market at the time. Initially defiant in the face of pressure from Chinese officials, Disney has since distanced itself from the project, hurting Kundun's commercial profile. In the short term, the sheer eclecticism in evidence enhanced the director's reputation. In the long term, however, it appears Kundun has been sidelined in most critical appraisals of the director, mostly noted as a stylistic and thematic detour. Kundun was the Scorsese's second attempt to profile the life of a great religious leader, following The Last Temptation of Christ.\nBringing Out the Dead (1999) was a return to familiar territory, with the director and writer Paul Schrader constructing a pitch-black comic take on their own earlier Taxi Driver. Like earlier Scorsese-Schrader collaborations, its final scenes of spiritual redemption explicitly recall the films of Robert Bresson. (It is also worth noting that the film's incident-filled nocturnal setting is reminiscent of After Hours.) It received generally positive reviews, although not the universal critical acclaim of some of his other films. It stars Nicolas Cage, Ving Rhames, John Goodman, Tom Sizemore, and Patricia Arquette.\nOn various occasions Scorsese has been asked to present the Honorary Academy Award during the Oscar telecast. In 1998, at the 70th Academy Awards, Scorsese presented the award to film legend Stanley Donen. When accepting the award Donen quipped, \"Marty this is backwards, I should be giving this to you, believe me\". In 1999, at the 71st Academy Awards, Scorsese and De Niro presented the award to film director Elia Kazan. This was a controversial pick for the academy due to Kazan's involvement with the Hollywood blacklist in the 1950s. Several members of the audience including Nick Nolte and Ed Harris refused to applaud Kazan when he received the award while others such as Warren Beatty, Meryl Streep, Kathy Bates, and Kurt Russell gave him a standing ovation.\n\n2000\u20132015: Film and television work\nIn 1999, Scorsese directed a documentary on Italian filmmakers titled Il Mio Viaggio in Italia, also known as My Voyage to Italy. The documentary foreshadowed the director's next project, the epic Gangs of New York (2002), influenced by (amongst many others) major Italian directors such as Luchino Visconti and filmed in its entirety at Rome's famous Cinecitt\u00e0 film studios. With a production budget said to be in excess of $100 million, Gangs of New York was Scorsese's biggest and arguably most mainstream venture to date. Like The Age of Innocence, it was set in 19th-century New York, although focusing on the other end of the social scale (and like that film, also starring Daniel Day-Lewis). The film marked the first collaboration between Scorsese and actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who became a fixture in later Scorsese films. The production was highly troubled, with many rumors referring to the director's conflict with Miramax boss Harvey Weinstein. Despite denials of artistic compromise, some felt that it was the director's most conventional film, featuring standard film tropes that the director had traditionally avoided, such as characters existing purely for exposition purposes and explanatory flashbacks.\nThe final cut of the movie ran to 168 minutes, while the director's original cut was over 180 minutes long. Even so, the film received generally positive reviews with the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reporting that 75 percent of the reviews for the film they tallied were positive and summarizing the critics writing, \"Though flawed, the sprawling, messy Gangs of New York is redeemed by impressive production design and Day-Lewis's electrifying performance.\" The film's central themes are consistent with the director's established concerns: New York, violence as culturally endemic, and subcultural divisions down ethnic lines. Originally filmed for a release in the winter of 2001 (to qualify for Academy Award nominations), Scorsese delayed the final production of the film until after the beginning of 2002; the studio consequently delayed the film until its release in the Oscar season of late 2002. Gangs of New York earned Scorsese his first Golden Globe for Best Director. In February 2003, Gangs of New York received 10 Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor for Daniel Day-Lewis; however, it did not win in any category.\nThe following year, Scorsese completed production of The Blues, an expansive seven-part documentary tracing the history of blues music from its African roots to the Mississippi Delta and beyond. Seven film-makers including Wim Wenders, Clint Eastwood, Mike Figgis, and Scorsese himself each contributed a 90-minute film (Scorsese's entry was titled Feel Like Going Home). In the early 2000s, Scorsese produced several films for up-and-coming directors, such as You Can Count on Me (directed by Kenneth Lonergan), Rain (directed by Katherine Lindberg), Lymelife (directed by Derick Martini) and The Young Victoria (directed by Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e). At that time, he established Sikelia Productions. In 2003, producer Emma Tillinger Koskoff joined the company. Scorsese also produced several documentaries, such as The Soul of a Man (directed by Wim Wenders) and Lightning in a Bottle (directed by Antoine Fuqua).\n\nScorsese's film The Aviator (2004) is a lavish, large-scale biopic of eccentric aviation pioneer and film mogul Howard Hughes and reunited Scorsese with actor Leonardo DiCaprio. The film received highly positive reviews. The film was a widespread box office success and gained Academy recognition. The Aviator was nominated for six Golden Globe awards, including Best Motion Picture-Drama, Best Director, Best Screenplay, and Best Actor-Motion Picture Drama for Leonardo DiCaprio. It won three, including Best Motion Picture-Drama and Best Actor-Motion Picture Drama. In January 2005 The Aviator became the most-nominated film of the 77th Academy Awards nominations, nominated in 11 categories including Best Picture. The film also garnered nominations in nearly all the other major categories, including a fifth Best Director nomination for Scorsese. Despite having the most nominations, the film won only five Oscars. Scorsese lost again, this time to director Clint Eastwood for Million Dollar Baby (which also won Best Picture).\nNo Direction Home is a documentary film by Scorsese that tells of the life of Bob Dylan, and his impact on American popular music and the culture of the 20th century. The film does not cover Dylan's entire career; it focuses on his beginnings, his rise to fame in the 1960s, his then-controversial transformation from an acoustic guitar-based musician and performer to an electric guitar-influenced sound and his \"retirement\" from touring in 1966 following an infamous motorcycle accident. The film was first presented on television in both the United States (as part of the PBS American Masters series) and the United Kingdom (as part of the BBC Two Arena series) on September 26 to 27, 2005. A DVD version of the film was released the same month. The film won a Peabody Award and the Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video. In addition, Scorsese received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Directing for a Documentary\/Nonfiction Program, losing to Baghdad ER.\n\nScorsese returned to the crime genre with the Boston-set thriller The Departed, based on the Hong Kong police drama Infernal Affairs (which is co-directed by Andrew Lau and Alan Mak). The film continued Scorsese's collaboration with Leonardo DiCaprio and was the first time he worked with Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, and Martin Sheen. The Departed opened to widespread critical acclaim, with some proclaiming it as one of the best efforts Scorsese had brought to the screen since 1990's Goodfellas, and still others putting it at the same level as Scorsese's most celebrated classics Taxi Driver and Raging Bull. With domestic box office receipts surpassing US$129.4 million, The Departed was Scorsese's highest-grossing film (not accounting for inflation) until 2010's Shutter Island. The Departed earned Scorsese a second Golden Globe for Best Director, as well as a Critics' Choice Award, his first Directors Guild of America Award, and the Academy Award for Best Director. Presented with the latter, Scorsese poked fun at his track record of nominations, asking, \"Could you double-check the envelope?\" The award was presented by his longtime friends and colleagues Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. The Departed also received the Academy Award for the Best Motion Picture of 2006, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film Editing by longtime Scorsese editor Thelma Schoonmaker, her third win for a Scorsese film.\nShine a Light captures rock and roll band The Rolling Stones' performing at New York City's Beacon Theatre on October 29 and November 1, 2006, intercut with brief news and interview footage from throughout their career. The film was initially scheduled for release on September 21, 2007, but Paramount Classics postponed its general release until April 2008. Its world premiere was at the opening of the 58th Berlinale Film Festival on February 7, 2008. \"Marty did an amazing job of making us look great...\" observed drummer Charlie Watts. \"It's all in the edits and the cuts. That's a movie maker rather than a guy just shooting a band onstage... It's not Casablanca, but it's a great thing to have from our point of view, not being egotistical. It's a document.\"\nIn 2009, Scorsese signed a petition in support of director Roman Polanski, who had been detained while traveling to a film festival in relation to his 1977 sexual abuse charges, which the petition argued would undermine the tradition of film festivals as a place for works to be shown \"freely and safely\", and that arresting filmmakers traveling to neutral countries could open the door \"for actions of which no-one can know the effects.\"\nOn October 22, 2007, Daily Variety reported that Scorsese would reunite with Leonardo DiCaprio on a fourth picture, Shutter Island. Principal photography on the Laeta Kalogridis screenplay, based on the novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane, began in Massachusetts in March 2008. In December 2007, actors Mark Ruffalo, Max von Sydow, Ben Kingsley, and Michelle Williams joined the cast, marking the first time these actors had worked with Scorsese. The film was released on February 19, 2010. On May 20, 2010, Shutter Island became Scorsese's highest-grossing film. In 2010, The Wall Street Journal reported that Scorsese was supporting the David Lynch Foundation's initiative to help 10,000 military veterans overcome posttraumatic stress disorder through Transcendental Meditation; Scorsese has publicly discussed his own practice of TM.\n\nScorsese directed a television commercial for Chanel's then-new men's fragrance, Bleu de Chanel, starring French actor Gaspard Ulliel. Filmed in New York City, it debuted online on August 25, 2010, and was released on TV in September 2010. Scorsese directed the series premiere for Boardwalk Empire, an HBO drama series, starring Steve Buscemi and Michael Pitt, based on Nelson Johnson's book Boardwalk Empire: The Birth, High Times and Corruption of Atlantic City. Terence Winter, who wrote for The Sopranos, created the series. In addition to directing the pilot (for which he won the 2011 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing), Scorsese also served as an executive producer on the series. The series premiered on September 19, 2010, and ran for five seasons.\nScorsese directed the three-and-a-half-hour documentary George Harrison: Living in the Material World about the life and music of former Beatles' member George Harrison, which premiered in the United States on HBO over two parts on October 5 and 6, 2011. His next film Hugo is a 3D adventure drama film based on Brian Selznick's novel The Invention of Hugo Cabret. The film stars Asa Butterfield, Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, Ben Kingsley, Sacha Baron Cohen, Ray Winstone, Emily Mortimer, Christopher Lee, and Jude Law. The film has been met with critical acclaim and earned Scorsese his third Golden Globe Award for Best Director. The film was also nominated for 11 Academy Awards, winning five of them and becoming tied with Michel Hazanavicius's film The Artist for the most Academy Awards won by a single film in 2011. Hugo also won two BAFTA awards, among numerous other awards and nominations. Hugo was Scorsese's first 3D film and was released in the United States on November 23, 2011.\n\nScorsese's 2013 film, The Wolf of Wall Street, is an American biographical black comedy based on Jordan Belfort's memoir of the same name. The screenplay was written by Terence Winter and starred Leonardo DiCaprio as Belfort, along with Jonah Hill, Matthew McConaughey, and others. The film marked the fifth collaboration between Scorsese and DiCaprio and the second between Scorsese and Winter after Boardwalk Empire. It was released on December 25, 2013. The film tells the story of a New York stockbroker, played by DiCaprio, who engages in a large securities fraud case involving illicit stock manipulation, by way of the practice of \"pump and dump\". DiCaprio was given the award for Best Actor-Motion Picture Musical or Comedy at the 2014 Golden Globe Awards. The film was also nominated for Best Motion Picture-Musical or Comedy as well. The Wolf of Wall Street was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor for Leonardo DiCaprio, Best Supporting Actor for Jonah Hill, Best Director for Martin Scorsese, and Best Adapted Screenplay for Terence Winter but did not win in any category. In a 2016 critics' poll conducted by the BBC, the film was ranked among the 100 greatest motion pictures since 2000.\nScorsese and David Tedeschi made a documentary about the history of the New York Review of Books, titled The 50 Year Argument. It screened as a work in progress at the Berlin International Film Festival in February 2014 and premiered in June 2014 at the Sheffield Doc\/Fest. It was also screened in Oslo, and Jerusalem before being shown on the BBC's Arena series in July and at Telluride in August. In September, it was screened at the Toronto and Calgary International Film Festivals, and the New York Film Festival. It aired on HBO on September 29, 2014.\nScorsese directed the pilot for Vinyl written by Terence Winter and George Mastras, with Mick Jagger producing and Mastras as showrunner. The series stars Bobby Cannavale as Richie Finestra, founder and president of a top-tier record label, set in 1970s New York City's drug-and sex-fueled music business as punk and disco were breaking out, all told through the eyes of Finestra trying to resurrect his label and find the next new sound. Filming began on July 25, 2014. Co-stars include Ray Romano, Olivia Wilde, Juno Temple, Andrew Dice Clay, Ato Essandoh, Max Casella, and James Jagger. On December 2, 2014, Vinyl was picked up by HBO. The series lasted one season. Scorsese has acted as executive producer of several indie films, like the 2014 The Third Side of the River (directed by his protege Celina Murga), another 2014 film Revenge of the Green Dragons (co-directed by Andrew Lau, whose film Infernal Affairs inspired The Departed), as well as Bleed for This and Free Fire.\nScorsese directed The Audition, a short film that also served as a promotional piece for casinos Studio City in Macau and City of Dreams in Manila, Philippines. The short brought together Scorsese's long-time muses Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro for the first time under his direction. The short film featured the two actors, playing fictionalized versions of themselves, competing for a role in Scorsese's next film. It was Scorsese's first collaboration with De Niro in two decades. The film premiered in October 2015 in conjunction with the grand opening of Studio City.\n\n2016\u2013present\nScorsese had long anticipated filming an adaptation of Sh\u016bsaku End\u014d's novel Silence, a drama about the lives of two Portuguese Jesuit priests in Japan during the 17th century. He had originally planned Silence as his next project following Shutter Island. On April 19, 2013, financing was secured for Silence by Emmett\/Furla Films, and filming began in January 2015. By November 2016, the film had completed post-production. It was written by Jay Cocks and Scorsese, based on the novel, and stars Andrew Garfield, Liam Neeson, and Adam Driver. The film was released on December 23, 2016, to positive reviews from critics. Scorsese was recognized as an Italian citizen by jus sanguinis in 2018.\nOn January 10, 2019, Variety's Chris Willman reported that Scorsese's long-anticipated documentary of Bob Dylan's 1975 tour, the Rolling Thunder Revue, would be released by Netflix: \"Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story by Martin Scorsese captures the troubled spirit of America in 1975 and the joyous music that Dylan performed during the fall of that year. Part documentary, part concert film, part fever dream, Rolling Thunder is a one of a kind experience, from master filmmaker Martin Scorsese.\" On April 25, 2019, it was announced that the documentary would be released on Netflix on June 12, 2019, with a concurrent theatrical engagement in twenty American, European, and Australian cities the night before, and an extended theatrical schedule in Los Angeles and New York so that the film will qualify for award consideration. After years of development, principal photography on Scorsese's crime film The Irishman, based on the book I Heard You Paint Houses by Charles Brandt, began in August 2017, starring Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Al Pacino. The film had its world premiere at the 57th New York Film Festival on September 27, 2019. It received a limited theatrical release on November 1, 2019, followed by digital streaming on November 27, 2019, on Netflix. In January 2020, The Irishman received ten Academy Award nominations, including for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actor for Pacino and Pesci.\nOn December 29, 2020, the trailer for Scorsese's Netflix documentary series Pretend It's a City was released. The series features Fran Lebowitz and Scorsese as they delve into her personal beliefs and thoughts on New York City. The project was released January 8, 2021, on Netflix. This is Scorsese's second documentary featuring Lebowitz, the first being Public Speaking (2010) which was released on HBO. In October 2022, Scorsese and David Tedeschi premiered their collaborative film Personality Crisis: One Night Only, at the New York Film Festival. The film is a documentary about David Johansen, featuring both contemporary concert footage shot for the project as well as archival footage.\n\nIn July 2019, Scorsese started scouting locations in preparation for the 2020 filming of his next film Killers of the Flower Moon, a film adaptation of the book of the same name by David Grann. Scorsese would team up with Leonardo DiCaprio for the sixth time and Robert De Niro for the tenth time. In December 2019, Scorsese's frequent cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto confirmed that Flower Moon was gearing up to start principal photography in March 2020, which was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2020, it was announced that filming for Killers of the Flower Moon had been postponed indefinitely in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, that the potential cost of the film had ballooned to $200 million, and that Scorsese was in talks with Netflix or Apple Inc. to produce and distribute, with Paramount Pictures involved as a partner. On May 27, 2020, Apple bought the production and distribution rights to the film, which was released theatrically by Paramount and streamed on Apple TV+. Principal photography commenced in April 2021. It premiered at the 76th Cannes Film Festival on May 20, 2023, receiving a nine-minute standing ovation and was released theatrically on October 20, 2023. On May 16, 2023, while promoting Killers of the Flower Moon, Scorsese spoke about his eagerness to continue working, stating that \"I'm old. I read stuff. I see things. I want to tell stories, and there's no more time.\" It was nominated for ten Oscars, and seven Golden Globes, winning one for Best Actress in a Drama Lily Gladstone. That same year he directed a commercial for Bleu de Chanel starring Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. \nIn 2024 Scorsese narrated the documentary film Made in England: The Films of Powell and Pressburger directed by David Hinton. Guy Lodge of Variety wrote, \"Scorsese may not have directed this engaging tour through a vital filmography, but he narrates with palpable, personal devotion to his subject.\" The film premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival where it was picked up for distribution by MUBI.\nIn March 2024, Scorsese settled a lawsuit with aspiring screenwriter Simon Afram. Afram accused him of pocketing $500,000 to help handle casting, production and postproduction of his screenplay about World War II's Operation Fortitude, which was titled Operation Fortitude, only for Scorsese to then doing nothing.\n\nUpcoming projects\nIn November 2021, Scorsese was set to direct a biopic feature about rock band the Grateful Dead for Apple Studios featuring Jonah Hill. In July 2022, it was announced Scorsese would direct an adaptation of David Grann's non-fiction novel The Wager for Apple Studios, reteaming once again with DiCaprio. In May 2023, after meeting with Pope Francis, Scorsese said he was considering writing and directing a new film about Jesus. More details were revealed in January 2024, revealing that it would likely be Scorsese's next film and that he had co-written it with Kent Jones, based on the Sh\u016bsaku End\u014d novel A Life of Jesus. In 2023 during an interview with GQ it was revealed that Scorsese was working on an adaptation of Marilynne Robinson's Home with Todd Field and Kent Jones.\n\nFilmmaking style and technique\nSeveral recurring filmmaking techniques are identifiable in many of Scorsese's films. He has established a filmmaking history which involves repeat collaborations with actors, screenwriters, film editors, and cinematographers, sometimes extending over several decades, such as that with recurring cinematographers Michael Ballhaus, Robert Richardson, and Rodrigo Prieto.\n\nSlow motion and freeze frame\nScorsese is known for his frequent use of slow motion, for example, in Who's That Knocking at My Door (1967) and Mean Streets (1973). He is also known for using freeze frames, such as: in the opening credits of The King of Comedy (1983), throughout Goodfellas (1990), Casino (1995), The Departed (2006), and in The Irishman (2019). His blonde leading ladies are usually seen through the eyes of the protagonist as angelic and ethereal; they wear white in their first scene and are photographed in slow motion\u2014Cybill Shepherd in Taxi Driver; Cathy Moriarty's white bikini in Raging Bull; Sharon Stone's white minidress in Casino. This may be a nod to director Alfred Hitchcock. Scorsese often uses long tracking shots, as seen in Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Casino, Gangs of New York, and Hugo. MOS sequences set to popular music or voice-over are regularly seen in his films, often involving aggressive camera movement or rapid editing. Scorsese sometimes highlights characters in a scene with an iris, an homage to 1920s silent film cinema (as scenes at the time sometimes used this transition). This effect can be seen in Casino (it is used on Sharon Stone and Joe Pesci), Life Lessons, The Departed (on Matt Damon), and Hugo. Some of his films include references\/allusions to Westerns, particularly Rio Bravo, The Great Train Robbery, Shane, The Searchers, and The Oklahoma Kid. Slow motion flashbulbs and accented camera\/flash\/shutter sounds are often used, as is the song \"Gimme Shelter\" by The Rolling Stones heard in several of Scorsese's films: Goodfellas, Casino, and The Departed.\n\nCameo appearances\nScorsese usually has a quick cameo in his films (Who's That Knocking at My Door, Boxcar Bertha, Mean Streets, Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy, After Hours, The Last Temptation of Christ (albeit hidden under a hood), The Age of Innocence, Gangs of New York, Hugo, Killers of the Flower Moon), he is also known to contribute his voice to a film without appearing on screen (e.g. as in The Aviator and The Wolf of Wall Street). In The Age of Innocence, for example, he appears in the non-speaking role of a large format portrait photographer in one of the passing scenes of the film. He provides the opening voice-over narration in Mean Streets and The Color of Money; plays the off-screen dressing room attendant in the final scene of Raging Bull, and provides the voice of the unseen ambulance dispatcher in Bringing Out the Dead. He also appears as the director of fictional newly formed Vatican Television in the Italian comedy In the Pope's Eye.\n\nReligious guilt\nGuilt is a prominent theme in many of his films, as is the role of Catholicism in creating and dealing with guilt (Who's That Knocking at My Door, Mean Streets, Raging Bull, Bringing Out the Dead, The Departed, Shutter Island, and The Irishman). In a similar manner, Scorsese considered Silence a \"passion project\": it had been in development since 1990, two years after the release of his film The Last Temptation of Christ, which also contained strongly religious themes. When asked why he retained interest in a project dealing with strong theological themes for over 26 years, Scorsese said,As you get older, ideas go and come. Questions, answers, loss of the answer again and more questions, and this is what really interests me. Yes, the cinema and the people in my life and my family are most important, but ultimately as you get older, there's got to be more ... Silence is just something that I'm drawn to in that way. It's been an obsession, it has to be done ... it's a strong, wonderful true story, a thriller in a way, but it deals with those questions.\n\nPolitical corruption\nMore recently, his films have featured corrupt authority figures, such as policemen in The Departed and politicians in Gangs of New York and The Aviator. He is also known for his liberal usage of profanity, dark humor, and violence.\n\nScorsese's interest in political corruption as depicted in his films was expanded further in his 2019 film The Irishman. Richard Brody writing for The New Yorker found the main interpretation of the film to be a dark allegory of a realist reading of American politics and American society stating: The real-life Hoffa... (was) a crucial player in both gangland politics and the actual practical politics of the day, and the movie's key through line is the inseparability of those two realms. The Irishman is a sociopolitical horror story that views much of modern American history as a continuous crime in motion, in which every level of society\u2014from domestic life through local business through big business through national and international politics\u2014is poisoned by graft and bribery, shady deals and dirty money, threats of violence and its gruesome enactment, and the hard-baked impunity that keeps the entire system running.\n\nFrequent collaborators\nScorsese often casts the same actors in his projects, particularly Robert De Niro, who has collaborated with Scorsese on ten feature films and one short film. Included are the three films (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and Goodfellas) that made AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies list. Scorsese has often said he thinks De Niro's best work under his direction was Rupert Pupkin in The King of Comedy. After the turn of the century, Scorsese found a new muse with younger actor Leonardo DiCaprio, collaborating on six feature films and one short to date. Several critics have compared Scorsese's new partnership with DiCaprio with his previous one with De Niro. Frequent collaborators also include: Victor Argo (6), Harvey Keitel (6), Harry Northup (6), J. C. MacKenzie (5), Murray Moston (5), Illeana Douglas (4), Joe Pesci (4), Frank Vincent (3), Barry Primus (3), and Verna Bloom (3). Others who have appeared in multiple Scorsese projects include Daniel Day-Lewis, who had become very reclusive to the Hollywood scene, Alec Baldwin, Willem Dafoe, Ben Kingsley, Jude Law, Dick Miller, Liam Neeson, Emily Mortimer, Jesse Plemons, John C. Reilly, David Carradine, Barbara Hershey, Kevin Corrigan, Jake Hoffman, Frank Sivero, Ray Winstone and Nick Nolte. Before their deaths, Scorsese's parents, Charles Scorsese and Catherine Scorsese, appeared in bit parts, walk-ons or supporting roles, such as in Goodfellas.\nFor his crew, Scorsese frequently worked with editors Marcia Lucas and Thelma Schoonmaker, cinematographers Michael Ballhaus, Robert Richardson, Michael Chapman and Rodrigo Prieto, screenwriters Paul Schrader, Mardik Martin, Jay Cocks, Terrence Winter, John Logan and Steven Zaillian, costume designer Sandy Powell, production designers Dante Ferretti and Bob Shaw, music producer Robbie Robertson, and composers Howard Shore and Elmer Bernstein. Schoonmaker, Richardson, Powell, and Ferretti have each won Academy Awards in their respective categories on collaborations with Scorsese. Elaine and Saul Bass, the latter being Hitchcock's frequent title designer, designed the opening credits for Goodfellas, The Age of Innocence, Casino and Cape Fear.\n\nPersonal life\nMarriages\nScorsese has been married five times. \nIn 1965, Scorsese married Laraine Marie Brennan. They have a daughter, Catherine, who was named after Scorsese's mother. The couple remained together until 1971.\nIn 1976, Scorsese married writer Julia Cameron. They have a daughter, Domenica Cameron-Scorsese, an actress who appeared in The Age of Innocence. After one year of marriage, the couple had an acrimonious divorce which served as the basis of Cameron's first feature, the dark comedy God's Will, which also starred their daughter. The latter had a small role in Cape Fear using the name Domenica Scorsese and has continued to act, write, direct, and produce.\nIn 1979, Scorsese married actress Isabella Rossellini. The couple divorced in 1983.\nIn March 1983, Scorsese met Dawn Steel (then-junior executive at Paramount) at an annual ShoWest Convention (in Las Vegas, NV), after which the pair began a relationship.  Scorsese moved from New York to live in her Sunset Plaza residence while his Last Temptation of Christ was initially in development at Paramount (Steel reportedly recused herself from her boyfriend's passion project). In her 1993 memoir, Steel discussed their relationship, including attending the Cannes Film Festival premier of King of Comedy and later location scouting in Tunisia together. The two would reconnect, professionally, in 1987, jumpstarting the restoration of Lawrence of Arabia (shortly after Steel's installation as President at Columbia Pictures).\nIn 1985, Scorsese married producer Barbara De Fina. The couple divorced in 1991. \nFrom 1989 to 1997, Scorsese was romantically involved with actress Illeana Douglas.\nIn 1999, Scorsese married Helen Schermerhorn Morris. They have a daughter, actress and filmmaker Francesca, who appeared in his films The Departed, Hugo, and The Aviator, and had a leading role in HBO\/Sky's miniseries We Are Who We Are in 2020.\n\nPolitics\nScorsese was an opponent of the Iraq War, wearing a white dove pin to the 75th Academy Awards in 2003 and clapping for Michael Moore's acceptance speech wherein he criticized President George W. Bush and the invasion.\n\nReligious beliefs\nScorsese identifies as a lapsed Catholic, declaring \"I'm a lapsed Catholic. But I am Roman Catholic; there's no way out of it.\" In 2016, Scorsese identified himself as a Catholic again, saying, \"my way has been, and is, Catholicism. After many years of thinking about other things, dabbling here and there, I am most comfortable as a Catholic. I believe in the tenets of Catholicism.\"\n\nFilmography\nAs of 2023, Scorsese has directed 26 full-length films and 16 full-length documentary films.\n\nOther work\nFilm preservation\nScorsese had been at the forefront in film preservation and restoration ever since 1990, when he created The Film Foundation, a non-profit film organization which collaborates with film studios to restore prints of old or damaged films. Scorsese launched the organization with Woody Allen, Robert Altman, Francis Ford Coppola, Clint Eastwood, Stanley Kubrick, George Lucas, Sydney Pollack, Robert Redford, and Steven Spielberg, who all sat on the foundation's original board of directors. In 2006, Paul Thomas Anderson, Wes Anderson, Curtis Hanson, Peter Jackson, Ang Lee and Alexander Payne joined them. In 2015, Christopher Nolan also joined the board. Recent members include Spike Lee, Sofia Coppola, Guillermo del Toro, Barry Jenkins, Lynne Ramsay, Joanna Hogg and Kathryn Bigelow.\nThe foundation has restored more than 800 films from around the world and conducts a free educational curriculum for young people on the language and history of film. Scorsese and the Foundation spearheaded fundraising for the film restoration of Michael Powell, and Emeric Pressburger's The Red Shoes (1948). For his advocacy in film restoration he received the Robert Osborne Award at the 2018 TCM Film Festival. The award was given to Scorsese as \"an individual who has significantly contributed to preserving the cultural heritage of classic films\".\nIn November 2020, The Criterion Channel released a 30-minute video titled, 30 Years of The Film Foundation: Martin Scorsese and Ari Aster in Conversation, celebrating the \"mission, evolution, and ongoing work of The Film Foundation\". Scorsese stated as of 2020, the Foundation has helped restore 850 films.\nOn April 20, 2024, Scorsese partnered with Seth MacFarlane to showcase Back From the Ink: Restored Animated Shorts at the 2024 TCM Classic Film Festival. Macfarlane and Scorsese funded the restoration, and worked with the UCLA Film and Television Archive and The Film Foundation with Paramount Pictures Archives.\n\nThe World Cinema Project\nIn 2007, Scorsese established the World Cinema Project with the mission to preserve and present marginalized and infrequently screened films from regions generally ill-equipped to preserve their own cinema history. Scorsese's organization has worked with the Criterion Collection to not only preserve the films but to allow them to be released on DVD and Blu-ray boxsets and on streaming services such as The Criterion Channel. Films in the WCP include Ousmane Semb\u00e8ne's Black Girl (1966), and Djibril Diop Mamb\u00e9ty's Touki Bouki (1973).\nThe Criterion Collection so far has released four Vol. boxsets on DVD and Blu-ray, titled, Martin Scorsese's World Cinema Project. The first Volume includes 6 titles, Touki Bouki (1973), Redes (1936), A River Called Titas (1973), Dry Summer (1964), Trances (1981) and The Housemaid (1960). The second volume also includes 6 titles, Insiang (1976), Mysterious Object at Noon (2000), Revenge (1989), Limite (1931), Law of the Border (1967), and Taipei Story (1985). The third volume includes 6 titles as well: Luc\u00eda (1968), After the Curfew (1954), Pixote (1980), Dos monjes (1934), Soleil \u00d4 (1970), and Downpour (1972). The 6 films included in the fourth set are Sambizanga (1972), Prisioneros de la tierra (1939), Chess of the Wind (1979), Muna Moto (1975), Two Girls on the Street (1939), and Kalpana (1948).\n\nThe African Film Heritage Project\nIn 2017, Scorsese also introduced The African Film Heritage Project (AFHP), which is a joint initiative between Scorsese's non-profit The Film Foundation, UNESCO, Cineteca di Bologna, and the Pan African Federation of Filmmakers (FEPACI). The project aims to locate and preserve 50 classic African films, some thought lost and others beyond repair, with hopes to make them available to audiences everywhere. In an interview with Cinema Escapist in 2018, Scorsese talked about the ambitious collaboration saying, \"Our first goal is to launch and conduct a thorough investigation in film archives and laboratories around the world, in order to locate the best surviving elements\u2014original negatives, we hope\u2014for our first 50 titles.\" He also stated that \"Restoration is always the primary goal, of course, but within the initiative, it's also a starting point of a process that follows through with exhibition and dissemination in Africa and abroad. And of course, our restoration process always includes the creation of preservation elements.\"\nIn 2019, the AFHP, announced that they would screen restorations of four African films on their home continent for the first time as part of the 50th anniversary of the Pan African Film Festival of Ouagadougou. The movies in question are Med Hondo's Soleil \u00d4 (1970), Mohammed Lakhdar-Hamina's Chronique des ann\u00e9es de braise (1975), Timit\u00e9 Bassori's La Femme au couteau (1969), and Jean-Pierre Dikongue-Pipa's Muna Moto (1975).\n\nFilm activism\nScorsese has mentioned his mentors being such filmmakers as John Cassavetes, Roger Corman, and Michael Powell. In film critic Roger Ebert's book, Scorsese by Ebert, Ebert praised Scorsese for championing and supporting other filmmakers by serving as an executive producer on projects of filmmakers such as Antoine Fuqua, Wim Wenders, Kenneth Lonergan, Stephen Frears, Allison Anders, Spike Lee, and John McNaughton. More recently he has executive produced the films of the Safdie Brothers, Joanna Hogg, Korn\u00e9l Mundrucz\u00f3, Josephine Decker, Danielle Lessovitz, Alice Rohrwacher, Jonas Carpignano, Am\u00e9lie van Elmbt, and Celina Murga. Scorsese has also chosen to name filmmakers throughout the years that he admires such as fellow New York City-based directors Woody Allen and Spike Lee, as well as other artists such as Wes Anderson, Bong Joon-ho, Greta Gerwig, Ari Aster, Kelly Reichardt, Claire Denis, Noah Baumbach, Paul Thomas Anderson, Christopher Nolan, the Coen Brothers, and Kathryn Bigelow.\n\nFavorite films\nIn 2012, Scorsese participated in the Sight & Sound film polls of that year. Held every ten years to select the greatest films of all time, contemporary directors were asked to select ten films of their choice. Scorsese, however, picked 12, which are listed below in alphabetical order:\n\nTen years later, Scorsese participated again in the Sight & Sound polls, picking 15 films, the same 12 of the 2012 list, plus the following:\n\nIn 1999, after the death of Gene Siskel, Scorsese joined Roger Ebert as the guest co-host for an episode of Siskel & Ebert where they each stated their 10 favorite films of the 1990s. Scorsese's list numerically is:\n\nIn 2012, Scorsese recommended 39 foreign films to Colin Levy.\nIn 2019, Martin Scorsese contributed his list of favorite films to LaCinetek, a streaming platform that compiles film lists from filmmakers worldwide. As a tireless cinephile, Scorsese submitted two lists: one featuring 73 \"founding\" films and another \"alternative list\" with 106 films. He also included a letter to C\u00e9dric Klapisch, one of LaCinetek's founders, explaining his selections and noting that many filmmakers and films he admires are not included in these lists.\n\nLegacy and honors\nScorsese's films have been nominated for numerous awards both nationally and internationally, with an Academy Award win for The Departed.

'Ministry of Letters and Science') is one of the eleven ministries of Japan that composes part of the executive branch of the government of Japan.  Its goal is to improve the development of Japan in relation with the international community. The ministry is responsible for funding research under its jurisdiction, some of which includes: children's health in relation to home environment, delta-sigma modulations utilizing graphs, gender equality in sciences, neutrino detection which contributes to the study of supernovas around the world, and other general research for the future.\n\nHistory\nThe Meiji government created the first Ministry of Education in 1871. In January 2001, the former Ministry of Education, Science, Sports and Culture and the former Science and Technology Agency (\u79d1\u5b66\u6280\u8853\u5e81, Kagaku-gijutsu-ch\u014d) merged to become the present MEXT.\n\nOrganization\nThe Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology currently is led by the minister of education, culture, sports, science and technology. Under that position is two state ministers, two parliamentary vice-ministers, and administrative vice-minister, and two deputy ministers. Beyond that the organization is divided as follows.\n\nMinister's Secretariat\nThe Minister's Secretariat is the department that manages general policies that affect the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology as a whole. These functions include many administrative jobs such as auditing policies, community relations, and overall human resource management for domestic and international relations alike.\n\nDirector-General for International Affairs\nThe Director-General for International Affairs, according to Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology's site, is the main point of contact between Japan's National Commission and United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The collective goal of the two organizations is to create mutual, sustainable development through education, science, and culture.\n\nDepartment of Facilities Planning and Disaster Prevention\nThe Department of Facilities Planning and Disaster Prevention is in charge of focusing on the ability of school facilities to reduce damage caused by disasters such as earthquakes. On top of this, Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology's site, also describes part of their duties as promoting  universities' endeavors in educational and research activities.\n\nEducation departments\nThese are the segments of the ministry with focus on the education portions of organization.\n\nEducation Policy Bureau\nThe Education Policy Bureau as a department upholds the concept of lifelong learning, introduced in the Basic Act on Education. Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology describes this department's duties as designing educational policy based on comprehensive and objective evidence.\n\nElementary and Secondary Education Bureau\nThe Elementary and Secondary Education Bureau is in charge of enhancing the educational development of students progressing through preschool to upper secondary schools, or any equivalent.\n\nHigher Education Bureau\nThe Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology describes the Higher Education Bureau as a department that focuses on promoting the education of undergraduate and graduate schools.

The scope of the department includes students as well as established professionals.\n\nResearch Promotion Bureau\nThe Research Promotion Bureau is a department that focuses on development of scientific research, as well as research in fields including technology and physics.\n\nResearch and Development Bureau\nThe Research and Development Bureau is slightly different from the Research Promotion Bureau as this department focuses on social problems including energy and the environment. Consequentially, this department would focus on exploration in space and deep sea.\n\nActivities and funded research\nWhile the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology currently contains multiple agencies, primarily a congregation of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, it actually began as the Ministry of Education. Over the years, Japan separately created each of the agencies that would eventually combine to make the current organization. Nonetheless, each department of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology researches programs and institutions to fund.\n\nChildren's health in relation to home environment\nDuring this research, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology concluded there were many intertwined dependencies between family homes, their environment, and how it impacts a child's growth and maturity.\n\nDelta-sigma conversion for graphing\nThe Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology have also been responsible in directly, although not fully, funding research into delta-sigma modulation, which in summary describes the graphing of analog-digital information to aid in the conversion of the two means.\n\nEducational research\nThe Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, were able to get their funding increased successfully through the years. They did so with the aid of one of their subgroups, the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science. The additional funds were likely aided in approval due to their source coming from national bonds rather than taxes. The programs, funded by the increased budget, include projects in new materials, molecular-scale surface dynamics, next-generation process technology, computer science, synthesis-based chemical engineering science, micro-mechatronics (micromachinery), biotechnology, human genome research, cell signaling, bioinformatics, brain research, Structural biology, life sciences, developmental biology, and biomedical engineering.\n\nEducational programs\nMEXT is one of three ministries that run the JET Programme.

That night, Shigeo visits the boat, where Kichi shows him a treasure trove of crabs. Kichi initiates a cruel game of burning crabs in oil, causing one to escape into the back room. Peeking through a small window, Shigeo witnesses Shouko in an intimate embrace with a tattooed man. Feeling awkward, Shigeo leaves without speaking to Kichi and remains silent as he passes Ginako on his way out.\nThe next day, as the boat begins to move away from the shore, Shigeo notices and rushes out, calling Kichi's name.

However, the impulsive president quickly procured a 35mm film and enlisted Oguri to direct a film using it. This led to the idea of adapting the novel by Teru Miyamoto, a project the president had long been interested in pursuing.\nThe original story unfolds along the Tosabori River in the city of Osaka. Despite Oguri's inability to find a suitable filming location in Osaka, he scoured Hiroshima and Tokyo without success. Ultimately, the decision was made to shoot the film along the Nakagawa Canal in Nagoya.\nDue to Mariko Kaga's prior commitments, a boat was transported to Toho Studios, where all scenes involving her were shot within a six-hour timeframe.\nWhile the initial production costs were set at 35 million yen, the budget exceeded by an additional 10 million yen. To cover this shortfall, producer Motoyasu Kimura had to secure a loan.\n\nDistribution\nDistribution posed a challenge initially due to the film being in black and white. Oguri turned to Nobuhiko Obayashi, a close friend from his early filmmaking days, who introduced the film to the Sogetsu Hall. Shigeru Okada, President of Toei, was deeply moved upon viewing the preview, describing it as an excellent film. Subsequently, Toei Central Film, a subsidiary of Toei, acquired the rights for 60 million yen and released the film nationwide through the Toei Pallas System.\n\nAwards\nKinema Junpo Best Ten:\nFirst place\nJapanese Film Director Award\nBest Supporting Actress: Mariko Kaga\nJapan Movie Pen Club: First place\nMainichi Film Competition:\nBest Film\/Best Director\nBest Actor Award: Takahiro Tamura\nBlue Ribbon Award for Best Work\nJapanese Academy Award for Best Film and Best Director\nExcellent Film Award from the Agency for Cultural Affairs\nSilver Prize at the Moscow International Film Festival\nOscar nomination for Best Foreign Language Film\nNewcomer Encouragement Award from the Japan Film Directors Association\n\nSee also\nList of submissions to the 54th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film\nList of Japanese submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nMuddy River at IMDb","128":"My Man (\u79c1\u306e\u7537, Watashi no Otoko) is a 2014 Japanese romantic drama film directed by Kazuyoshi Kumakiri and based on Kazuki Sakuraba's Watashi no Otoko novel.

Jungo, a 26 year-old distant relative of Hana's father and an orphan himself, decides to adopt Hana as a favor to her parents despite the misgivings of village elder Oshio.\nSix years later, Jungo and Hana live in Monbetsu, Hokkaido where Hana is now a high school student, Jungo works as a cook for the local coast guard, and Oshio serves as a grandfatherly figure to them. Jungo's girlfriend Komachi feels emotionally neglected by him and observes that he is more affectionate towards his adopted daughter than her. Visibly jealous at Komachi, Hana challenges her if she is willing to die for Jungo. Disturbed by their conversation, Komachi breaks up with Jungo and departs for Tokyo.\nJungo and Hana are revealed to be in a forbidden sexual relationship, spurred by their mutual loneliness and longing for one another. Oshio discovers the two having sex at home, with Hana spotting him outside but remaining silent. Oshio later confronts Hana by the sea and tells her that her father is manipulating her, revealing that he had discovered that Jungo is Hana's biological father, born from an affair Jungo had with Hana's mother when they were younger. Hana reveals that she had already known about Jungo being her real father, willingly sleeping with him to help each other get over the loneliness of losing their loved ones. Hana causes the ice Oshio is standing on to crack and drift away, and she coldly refuses to save him to keep her secret safe as he freezes to death.\nFollowing Oshio's funeral, Jungo and Hana move to Tokyo where the two continue their affair. Jungo finds work as a taxi driver while Hana continues her studies. Monbetsu coast guard officer Taoka travels to Tokyo to confront Jungo with evidence of Hana's involvement in Oshio's death, but Jungo kills Taoka to cover up their secret.\nYears later, Hana has become more independent after graduating from college, found a job as a receptionist, and discontinued having sex with her father. Jungo spirals into alcoholism out of guilt for killing Taoka and due his daughter's distance. Hana begins dating her coworker Yoshiro. When Yoshiro brings a drunk Hana home, a jealous Jungo humiliates Yoshiro by ordering him to strip down. Yoshiro pushes him off and leaves.\nAfter some time, an unkempt Jungo goes to meet Hana and her new fianc\u00e9 Daisuke at a fancy restaurant.

Its awards, which are announced in early December, are considered an early harbinger of the film awards season that culminates in the Academy Awards.\n\nOrigins\nThe organization, which is now a private organization of film enthusiasts, has its roots in 1909 when Charles Sprague Smith and others formed the New York Board of Motion Picture Censorship to make recommendations to the Mayor's office concerning controversial films. It quickly became known as the National Board of Motion Picture Censorship. In an effort to avoid government censorship of films, the National Board became the unofficial clearinghouse for new movies. The Board's stated purpose was to endorse films of merit and champion the new \"art of the people\", which was transforming America's cultural life. In March 1916 the Board changed its name to the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures to avoid the controversial word \"censorship\". \nProducers submitted their films to the board before making release prints; they agreed to cut any footage that the board found objectionable, up to and including destroying the entire film. Thousands of films carried the legend \"Passed by the National Board of Review\" in their main titles from 1916 into the 1950s, when the board began to lose financial support, partly due to the NBR being overshadowed by the MPAA regarding film censorship.\n\nIn 1930, the NBR was the first group to choose the 10 best English-language movies of the year and the best foreign films, and is still the first critical body to announce its annual awards. In 1936 executive secretary Wilton A. Barrett explained the Board's workings:The National Board is opposed to legal censorship regarding all forms of the motion picture...It believes that far more constructive ...is the method of selecting the better pictures, publishing descriptive, classified lists of them and building up audiences and support for them through the work of community groups...\n\nPublications\nThe NBR has also gained international acclaim for its publications, which collectively constitute the oldest film review and commentary publication in the US. Many back issues can now be viewed at the Media History Digital Library.\n\nFilm Program (1917\u20131926)\nExceptional Photoplays (1920\u20131925)\nPhotoplay Guide to Better Movies (1924\u20131926)\nNational Board of Review Magazine (1926\u20131942)\nNew Movies (1942\u20131949)\nFilms in Review (print: 1950\u20131997; online: 1997\u2013present) ISSN 0015-1688\n\nAward categories\nSee also\nMotion Picture Production Code\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nFilms in Review","131":"My Neighbor Totoro (Japanese: \u3068\u306a\u308a\u306e\u30c8\u30c8\u30ed, Hepburn: Tonari no Totoro) is a 1988 Japanese animated fantasy film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki and animated by Studio Ghibli for Tokuma Shoten. It stars the voices of Noriko Hidaka, Chika Sakamoto and Hitoshi Takagi, and focuses on two young sisters and their interactions with friendly wood spirits in postwar rural Japan.\nIn 1989, Streamline Pictures produced an English-language dub for exclusive use on transpacific flights of Japan Airlines. Troma Films, under their 50th St. Films banner, distributed the dub of the film. This dub was released in 1993 to United States theaters, and the following year on VHS and LaserDisc in the US by Fox Video in 1994, and on DVD in 2002. The rights to this dub expired in 2004, so Walt Disney Home Entertainment re-released the film on March 7, 2006, with a new dub cast. This DVD release is the first version of the film in the US to include both Japanese and English language tracks.\nThe film explores themes such as animism, Shinto symbology, environmentalism and the joys of rural living. My Neighbor Totoro received worldwide critical acclaim, and has grossed over $41 million worldwide at the box office as of September 2019; the film also grossed significantly more from home video sales and merchandise.\nMy Neighbor Totoro received numerous awards, including the Animage Anime Grand Prix prize, the Mainichi Film Award, and Kinema Junpo Award for Best Film in 1988. It also received the Special Award at the Blue Ribbon Awards in the same year. The film is considered as one of the top animation films, ranking 41st in Empire magazine's \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\" in 2010 and the number-one animated film on the 2012 Sight & Sound critics' poll of all-time greatest films. The film and its titular character have become cultural icons, and made multiple cameo appearances in other films. Totoro also serves as the mascot for Studio Ghibli and is recognized as one of the most popular characters in Japanese animation.\n\nPlot\nIn 1950s Japan, university professor Tatsuo Kusakabe and his daughters Satsuki and Mei (approximately ten and four years old, respectively) move into an old house close to the hospital where the girls' mother, Yasuko, is recovering from a long-term illness. The house is inhabited by small, dark, dust-like house spirits called susuwatari, that can be seen when moving from bright places to dark ones. The susuwatari leave to find another empty house. Mei discovers two small spirits that lead her into the hollow of a large camphor tree. She befriends a larger spirit, which identifies itself using a series of roars that she interprets as \"Totoro\". Mei thinks Totoro is the troll from her illustrated book Three Billy Goats Gruff. She falls asleep atop Totoro but when Satsuki finds her, she is on the ground. Despite many attempts, Mei cannot show her family Totoro's tree. Tatsuo comforts her, saying Totoro will reveal himself when he wants to.\n\nThe girls wait for Tatsuo's bus, which is late. Mei falls asleep on Satsuki's back and Totoro appears beside them, allowing Satsuki to see him for the first time. Totoro has only a leaf on his head for protection against the rain, prompting Satsuki to offer her umbrella to him. Delighted, he gives her a bundle of nuts and seeds in return. A giant, bus-shaped cat arrives; Totoro boards it and leaves. A few days after planting the seeds, the girls awaken at midnight to find Totoro and his fellow spirits engaged in a ceremonial dance around the planted seeds. They join in, causing the seeds to grow into an enormous tree. Totoro takes the girls for a ride on a magical flying top. In the morning, the tree is gone but the seeds have sprouted.\nThe girls discover that a planned visit by their mother has been postponed because of a setback in her treatment. Mei is upset and argues with Satsuki. She leaves for the hospital to take fresh corn to their mother, but gets lost on the way. Mei's disappearance prompts Satsuki and the neighbors to search for her, thinking that Mei has died. In desperation, Satsuki pleads for Totoro's help. Totoro summons the Catbus, which carries Satsuki to Mei's location, and the sisters reunite. The bus then takes them to the hospital, where the girls learn that their mother has been kept in the hospital by a minor cold but is otherwise recovering well. The girls secretly leave the ear of corn on the windowsill, where their parents discover it.\nEventually, their mother returns home and the girls play with other children while Totoro and his friends watch from afar.\n\nThemes\nAnimism is a major theme in My Neighbor Totoro, according to Eriko Ogihara-Schuck. Totoro has animistic traits and has kami status because he lives in a camphor tree in a Shinto shrine surrounded by a Shinto rope, and he is referred to as mori no nushi (master of the forest). Ogihara-Schuck writes that when Mei returns from her encounter with Totoro, her father takes Mei and her sister to the shrine to greet and thank Totoro. This is a common practice in the Shinto tradition following an encounter with a kami. According to Phillip E. Wegner, the film is an example of alternative history, citing the utopian-like setting of the anime.\n\nVoice cast\nProduction\nDevelopment\nAfter working on 3000 Miles in Search of a Mother, Miyazaki wanted to make a \"delightful, wonderful film\" that would be set in Japan with the idea to \"entertain and touch its viewers, but stay with them long after they have left the theaters\". Initially, Miyazaki had the main characters Totoro, Mei, Tatsuo, and Kanta.:\u200a8\u200a The director based Mei on his niece, and Totoros as \"serene, carefree creatures\" that were \"supposedly the forest keeper, but that's only a half-baked idea, a rough approximation\".:\u200a5,\u200a103\u200a\nArt director Kazuo Oga was drawn to the film when Hayao Miyazaki showed him an original image of Totoro standing in a satoyama. Miyazaki challenged Oga to raise his standards, and Oga's experience with My Neighbor Totoro began Oga's career. Oga and Miyazaki debated the film's color palette; Oga wanted to paint black soil from Akita Prefecture and Miyazaki preferred the color of red soil from Kant\u014d region.:\u200a82\u200a The finished film was described by Studio Ghibli producer Toshio Suzuki; \"It was nature painted with translucent colors\".\nOga's conscientious approach to My Neighbor Totoro was a style the International Herald Tribune recognized as \"[updating] the traditional Japanese animist sense of a natural world that is fully, spiritually alive\". The newspaper said of the film:\n\nSet in a period that is both modern and nostalgic, the film creates a fantastic, yet strangely believable universe of supernatural creatures coexisting with modernity. A great part of this sense comes from Oga's evocative backgrounds, which give each tree, hedge and twist in the road an indefinable feeling of warmth that seems ready to spring into sentient life.\nOga's work on My Neighbor Totoro led to his continued involvement with Studio Ghibli, which assigned him jobs that would play to his strengths, and Oga's style became a trademark style of Studio Ghibli.\nOnly one young girl, rather than two sisters, is depicted in several of Miyazaki's initial conceptual watercolor paintings, as well as on the theatrical release poster and on later home-video releases. According to Miyazaki; \"If she was a little girl who plays around in the yard, she wouldn't be meeting her father at a bus stop, so we had to come up with two girls instead. And that was difficult.\":\u200a11\u200a Miyazaki said the film's opening sequence was not storyboarded; \"The sequence was determined through permutations and combinations determined by the time sheets. Each element was made individually and combined in the time sheets ...\":\u200a27\u200a The ending sequence depicts the mother's return home and the signs of her return to good health by playing with Satsuki and Mei outside.:\u200a149\u200a\nMiyazaki stated that the story was initially intended to be set in 1955, however, the team was not thorough in the research and instead worked on a setting \"in the recent past\".:\u200a33\u200a The film was originally set to be an hour long but during production it grew to respond to the social context, including the reason for the move and the father's occupation.:\u200a54\u200a Eight animators worked on the film, which was completed in eight months.\nTetsuya Endo noted numerous animation techniques were used in the film. For example, ripples were designed with \"two colors of high-lighting and shading\" and the rain for My Neighbor Totoro was \"scratched in the cels\" and superimposed for it to convey a soft feel.:\u200a156\u200a The animators stated one month was taken to create the tadpoles, which included four colors; the water for it was also blurred.:\u200a154\n\nMusic\nThe music for My Neighbor Totoro was composed by Joe Hisaishi, who previously collaborated with Miyazaki on the movies Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind and Castle in the Sky. Hisaishi was inspired by the contemporary composers Terry Riley, Philip Glass, Steve Reich, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and John Cage, and described Miyazaki's films as \"rich and personally compeling\". He hired an orchestra for the soundtrack and primarily used a Fairlight instrument.:\u200a169,\u200a170\u200a\n\nThe soundtrack for My Neighbor Totoro was first released in Japan on May 1, 1988, by Tokuma Shoten, and includes the musical score used in the film, except for five vocal pieces that were performed by Azumi Inoue, including \"Stroll\", \"A Lost Child\", and \"My Neighbor Totoro\". It had previously been released as an Image Song CD in 1987 that contains some songs that were not included in the film.\n\nRelease\nAfter writing and filming Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (1984) and Castle in the Sky (1986), Hayao Miyazaki began directing My Neighbor Totoro for Studio Ghibli. Miyazaki's production paralleled his colleague Isao Takahata's production of Grave of the Fireflies. Miyazaki's film was financed by executive producer Yasuyoshi Tokuma, and both My Neighbor Totoro and Grave of the Fireflies were released on the same bill in 1988. The dual billing was considered \"one of the most moving and remarkable double bills ever offered to a cinema audience\".\n\nBox office\nIn Japan, My Neighbor Totoro initially sold 801,680 tickets and earned a distribution rental income of \u00a5588 million in 1988. According to image researcher Seiji Kano, by 2005, the film's box-office gross receipts in Japan totalled \u00a51.17 billion ($10.6 million). In France, the film has sold 429,822 tickets since 1999. The film has been internationally released several times since 2002. The film has grossed $30,476,708 worldwide since 2002. A South China Morning Post article in 2021 reported that the film has grossed more than $41 million in total.\nThirty years after its original release in Japan, My Neighbor Totoro received a Chinese theatrical release in December 2018. The delay was due to long-standing political tensions between China and Japan but many Chinese people had become familiar with Miyazaki's films due to rampant video piracy. In its opening weekend, ending December 16, 2018, My Neighbor Totoro grossed $13 million, entering the box-office charts at number two behind Hollywood film Aquaman and ahead of Bollywood film Padman at number three. By its second weekend, My Neighbor Totoro had grossed $20 million in China. As of February 2019, it had grossed $25,798,550 in China.\n\nEnglish dubs\nIn 1989, US-based company Streamline Pictures produced an exclusive English language dub of My Neighbor Totoro for use as an in-flight movie on Japan Airlines flights. In April 1993, Troma Films, under its label 50th St. Films, distributed the dub of the film as a theatrical release. The songs for the Streamline version of My Neighbor Totoro were sung by Cassie Byram.\nIn 2004, Walt Disney Pictures produced a new English dub of My Neighbor Totoro to be released after the rights to the Streamline dub had expired. As is the case with Disney's other English dubs of Miyazaki films, the Disney version of My Neighbor Totoro has a star-heavy cast, including Dakota and Elle Fanning as Satsuki and Mei, Timothy Daly as Mr. Kusakabe, Pat Carroll as Granny, Lea Salonga as Mrs. Kusakabe, and Frank Welker as Totoro and Catbus. The songs for the new dub retain the translation as the earlier dub but are sung by Sonya Isaacs. The Disney dub was directed by Rick Dempsey, a Disney executive in charge of the company's dubbing services, and was written by Don and Cindy Hewitt, who had written other dubs for Studio Ghibli.\nDisney's English-language dub premiered on October 23, 2005; it was screened at the 2005 Hollywood Film Festival. The cable television network Turner Classic Movies (TCM) held the television premiere of Disney's new English dub in January 2006, as part of the network's tribute to Hayao Miyazaki. TCM aired the dub and the original Japanese film with English subtitles. The Disney version was released on DVD in the United States on March 7, 2006. In Australia, an English dub was also released by Madman Entertainment on March 15, 2006.\nIn 2023, the film was re-released in 970 United States locations as part of celebrations to mark the 35th anniversary of its first theatrical release, with showings in both Japanese with English subtitles and with the English dub.\n\nHome media\nTokuma Shoten released My Neighbor Totoro on VHS and LaserDisc in August 1988. Buena Vista Home Entertainment Japan (now Walt Disney Japan) reissued the VHS on June 27, 1997, as part of their series Ghibli ga Ippai. Disney released the film on Blu-ray in Japan on 2012.\nAfter the rights to the Streamline dub expired in 2004, Walt Disney Home Entertainment re-released the movie on DVD on March 7, 2006, with Disney's newly produced English dub and the original Japanese version. The company reissued My Neighbor Totoro, as well as Castle in the Sky, and Kiki's Delivery Service, with updated cover art highlighting its Studio Ghibli origins, on March 2, 2010, coinciding with the US DVD and Blu-ray debut of Ponyo. My Neighbor Totoro was re-released by Disney on Blu-Ray on May 21, 2013. GKIDS re-issued the film on Blu-ray and DVD on October 17, 2017.\nIn Japan, My Neighbor Totoro had sold 3.5 million VHS and DVD units as of April 2012, equivalent to approximately \u00a516,100 million ($202 million) at an average retail price of \u00a54,600 (\u00a54,700 on DVD and \u00a54,500 on VHS). In the United States, the film sold over 500,000 VHS units by 1996, with the later 2010 DVD release selling a further 3.8 million units and grossing $64.5 million in the United States as of October 2018.\nIn the UK, the film's Studio Ghibli anniversary release appeared on the annual lists of ten-best-selling foreign language films on home video for five consecutive years, ranking number seven in 2015, number six in 2016 and 2017, number one in 2018, and number two in 2019 below Spirited Away.\n\nReception\nMy Neighbor Totoro received widespread acclaim from film critics. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 93% of 59 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.4\/10. The website's consensus reads: \"My Neighbor Totoro is a heartwarming, sentimental masterpiece that captures the simple grace of childhood.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 86 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\nIn 2001, Japanese magazine Animage ranked My Neighbor Totoro 45th in its list of 100 Best Anime Productions of All Time. My Neighbor Totoro was voted the highest-ranking animated film on Sight & Sound's critics' poll of all-time greatest films, and joint 154th overall. In 2022, the magazine ranked the film as the joint-72nd-greatest film overall, being one of two animated films included in the list. My Neighbor Totoro was ranked third on the list of \"Greatest Japanese Animated Films of All Time\" by film magazine Kinema Junpo in 2009, 41st in Empire magazine's \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\" in 2010, second on a similar Empire list of best children's films, and number one in the greatest animated films in Time Out; a similar list by the editors ranked the film in third place.\n\nFilm critic Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times identified My Neighbor Totoro as one of his \"Great Movies\", calling it \"one of the lovingly hand-crafted works of Hayao Miyazaki\". In his review, Ebert said the film \"is based on experience, situation and exploration\u2014not on conflict and threat\", and added:\nit would never have won its worldwide audience just because of its warm heart. It is also rich with human comedy in the way it observes the two remarkably convincing, lifelike little girls ... It is a little sad, a little scary, a little surprising and a little informative, just like life itself. It depends on a situation instead of a plot, and suggests that the wonder of life and the resources of imagination supply all the adventure you need.\nSteve Rose from The Guardian gave the film five stars, praising Miyazaki's \"rich, bright, hand-drawn\" animation and describing it as \"full of benign spirituality, prelapsarian innocence and joyous discovery, all rooted in a carefully detailed reality\". Trevor Johnston from Time Out also awarded the film five stars, commenting on its \"delicate rendering of the atmosphere\" and its first half that \"delicately captures both mystery and quietness\". Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited My Neighbor Totoro as one of his favorite films. Writing for the London Evening Standard, Charlotte O'Sullivan praised the charm of the film but said it lacks complexity in comparison with Spirited Away. Jordan Cronk from Slant awarded the film three-and-a-half stars but said it is \"devoid of much of the fantasia of Miyazaki's more outwardly visionary work\". In the 1996 movie guide \"Seen That, Now What?\", My Neighbor Totoro was given the rating of \"A\". The guide stated that the film is an \"enchanting, lushly animated view of the natural world with child's sense of wonder\", and noting its suitability for young children while being \"a perennial favorite among [film buffs]\".\nThe 1993 translation was not as well-received as the 2006 translation; Leonard Klady of Variety wrote the 1993 translation demonstrates \"adequate television technical craft\" that is characterized by \"muted pastels, homogenized pictorial style and [a] vapid storyline\". Klady described the film's environment as \"obviously aimed at an international audience\" but \"evinces a disorienting combination of cultures that produces a nowhere land more confused than fascinating\". Stephen Holden of The New York Times described the 1993 translation as \"very visually handsome\", and said the film is \"very charming\" when \"dispensing enchantment\". Despite the highlights, Holden wrote \"too much of the film, however, is taken up with stiff, mechanical chitchat\".\nMatthew Leyland of Sight & Sound reviewed the DVD released in 2006, commenting; \"Miyazaki's family fable is remarkably light on tension, conflict and plot twists, yet it beguiles from beginning to end ... what sticks with the viewer is the every-kid credibility of the girls' actions as they work, play and settle into their new surroundings\". Leyland praised the DVD transfer of the film but noted the disc lacks a look at the film's production, instead being overabundant with storyboards. Writing in Joe Hisaishi's Soundtrack for My Neighbor Totoro, Kunio Hara praised the soundtrack, describing the song \"My Neighbor Totoro\" as a \"sonic icon\" of the film. Hara also commented the music \"arouse[s] a similar sentiment of yearning for the past\".\n\nAwards and nominations\nLegacy\nMy Neighbor Totoro was considered a milestone for writer-director Hayao Miyazaki. The popularity of the film's central character Totoro among Japanese children has been likened to that of Winnie-the-Pooh in Britain. The Independent said Totoro is one of the greatest cartoon characters, describing the creature; \"At once innocent and awe-inspiring, King Totoro captures the innocence and magic of childhood more than any of Miyazaki's other magical creations\". The Financial Times recognized the character's appeal, commenting Totoro \"is more genuinely loved than Mickey Mouse could hope to be in his wildest\u2014not nearly so beautifully illustrated\u2014fantasies\". Empire also commented on Totoro's appeal, ranking him at number 18 on a list of the greatest animated characters of all time.\nThe character of Totoro later became a mascot and official logo for Studio Ghibli.\nAccording to the environmental journal Ambio, My Neighbor Totoro \"has served as a powerful force to focus the positive feelings that the Japanese people have for satoyama and traditional village life\". The film's central character Totoro was used as a mascot by the Japanese campaign \"Totoro Hometown Fund Campaign\", which aimed to preserve areas of satoyama in Saitama Prefecture. The fund, started in 1990 after the film's release, held an auction in August 2008 at Pixar Animation Studios to sell over 210 original paintings, illustrations, and sculptures inspired by My Neighbor Totoro.\nMiyazaki additionally uses Totoro as a part of his logo for Studio Ghibli. Totoro also makes a cameo appearance in the Pixar film Toy Story 3 (2010) but was not included in Toy Story 4 due to licensing problems. Toy Story 3's art director Daisuke Tsutsumi is married to Miyazaki's niece, who inspired the character Mei in My Neighbor Totoro.\n\nA main-belt asteroid that was discovered on December 31, 1994, was named 10160 Totoro. In 2013, Eoperipatus totoro, a species of velvet worm that was discovered in Vietnam, was named after Totoro. Following the request of the paper's authors, the species was named for the character because he \"uses a many-legged animal as a vehicle, which according to the collectors resembles a velvet worm\".\n\nMedia\nBooks\nIn Japan in May 1988, Tokuma published a four-volume series of ani-manga books, which use color images and lines directly from My Neighbor Totoro. The series was licensed for English-language release in North America by Viz Media, which released the books from November 10, 2004, through February 15, 2005. A 111-page picture book based on the film and aimed at young children was released by Tokuma on June 28, 1988, and, in a 112-page English translation, by Viz on November 8, 2005. Tokuma later released another 176-page art book containing conceptual art from the film and interviews with production staff on July 15, 1988, and, in English translation, by Viz on November 8, 2005. In 2013, Viz released a hardcover light novel that was written by Tsugiko Kubo and illustrated by Hayao Miyazaki.\n\nSequel\nMei and the Kittenbus (\u3081\u3044\u3068\u3053\u306d\u3053\u30d0\u30b9, Mei to Konekobasu) is a thirteen-minute sequel to My Neighbor Totoro that was written and directed by Miyazaki. Chika Sakamoto, who voiced Mei in Totoro, returned to voice Mei in this short. Hayao Miyazaki voiced Granny Cat (Neko Baa-chan) and Totoro. The sequel focuses on the character Mei Kusakabe from the original film and her one-night adventures with Kittenbus, the offspring of Catbus, and other cat-oriented vehicles. The sequel was first released in Japan in 2003 and is regularly shown at Ghibli Museum but has not been released on home video.\n\nMerchandise\nLicensed My Neighbor Totoro merchandise of Totoro has been sold in Japan for decades after the film's release. Sales of the film's licensed merchandise in Japan grossed \u00a510.97 billion in 1999, \u00a556.08 billion during 2003\u20132007, at least \u00a54.1 billion in 2008, and \u00a519.96 billion during 2010\u20132012.\n\nStage adaptation\nIn May 2022, the Royal Shakespeare Company and composer Joe Hisaishi announced that a stage adaptation of the film titled My Neighbor Totoro would run from 8 October 2022 to 21 January 2023 at the Barbican Centre in London. It was adapted by British playwright Tom Morton-Smith and directed by Improbable's Phelim McDermott. Tickets went on sale on 19 May 2022, breaking the theater's box-office record for sales in one day which was previously held by the 2015 production of Hamlet starring Benedict Cumberbatch. The show won six Olivier Awards.\nOn 30 March 2023, it was announced that the production will return to the Barbican for another season, which began on 21 November 2023 and ran until 23 March 2024.\n\nSee also\nJapan, Our Homeland and Mai Mai Miracle (also depicting Japan in the 1950s)\nEnchanted forest\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial U.S. website\nMy Neighbor Totoro (film) at Anime News Network's encyclopedia\nMy Neighbor Totoro at IMDb\nMy Neighbor Totoro at Rotten Tomatoes\nMei and the Kitten Bus (2002) at IMDb\nEntry Archived April 18, 2012, at the Wayback Machine in The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction\nJoe Hisaishi's Soundtrack for My Neighbor Totoro Archived November 1, 2020, at the Wayback Machine, book by Kunio Hara, 33-1\/3 Japan Series Archived February 2, 2021, at the Wayback Machine, Bloomsbury, ISBN 9781501345128","132":"No Regrets for Our Youth (Japanese: \u308f\u304c\u9752\u6625\u306b\u6094\u306a\u3057, Hepburn: Waga Seishun ni Kuinashi) is a 1946 Japanese film written and directed by Akira Kurosawa. It is based on the 1933 Takigawa incident,  and is considered a quintessential \"democratization film\", taking up many themes associated with social policy under the early Occupation of Japan.\nThe film stars Setsuko Hara, Susumu Fujita, Takashi Shimura and Denjir\u014d \u014ck\u014dchi. Fujita's character was inspired by the real-life Hotsumi Ozaki, who assisted the famous Soviet spy Richard Sorge and became the only Japanese citizen to suffer the death penalty for treason during World War II. The film is in black-and-white and runs 110 minutes.\n\nPlot\nThe film begins in 1933. Students at Kyoto Imperial University protest the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. Prominent professor Yagihara (Denjiro Okochi) is relieved of his post because of his views against fascism. The professor's daughter Yukie (Setsuko Hara) is courted by two of her father's students: Ryukichi Noge (Susumu Fujita) and Itokawa (Akitake K\u00f4no). Itokawa is equable and moderate while Noge is fiery and a radical leftist. Although she fights with him vigorously, Yukie is eventually drawn toward Noge.\nNoge disappears following an anti-militarist student protest, the result of being arrested and spending four years in jail. By the time Itokawa, now a prosecutor for the government, tells Yukie of Noge's whereabouts, he has been out of jail for a year. He warns her that he is a changed man and no longer how Yukie remembered him.\nItokawa brings Noge over to the Yagihara residence. During dinner, Professor Yagihara mentions that Noge would not have been released unless the government was convinced that Noge had \"converted\" from his radical ways. Noge confirms this and says that Itokawa vouched for him and had even found him a job in the army.\nAfter realizing that Noge has changed from his days at university, Yukie excuses herself from the dinner table and locks herself in her room. Her mother eventually tells her that the young men are leaving. Yukie is reluctant to see them out, but once her mother tells her that Noge is leaving for China she decides to see Noge one last time to say goodbye.\nAfter Noge's departure, Yukie begins to pack for Tokyo and has a deep conversation with her father. For three years in Tokyo, Yukie works in menial jobs to get by. One day she runs into Itokawa and is told that Noge is in the city. She goes to Noge's offices, but is reluctant to reconnect. Yukie is shown outside of the offices several times until eventually Noge notices her. They spend several years together and get married.\nYukie discovers that Noge is involved in dangerous and illegal activities, but they agree that she should not know exactly what they are. Noge is arrested the night before his plans are to go into effect. Yukie is interrogated, but she proffers no information. She is treated badly during the interrogations but Itokawa is eventually able to free her.\nHer parents take the train into Tokyo where Yukie's father meets up with Itokawa, thanks him for what he has done and informs him that he intends to represent Noge in court. Itokawa mournfully responds that Noge died the night before. Yukie is crushed. She brings his ashes to his parents, farmers in the countryside, and tells them she is his wife. Noge's father rejects her, believing that she has come to mock them because their son was convicted of being a spy but Yukie stays and works the rice fields with them. They are scorned and harassed in their village, and Yukie tries to convince them of her sincerity and that their son was a good man. The work in the rice fields is hard on her, but she is determined to prove her mettle, even to the point of working through a severe fever.\nThe night that Yukie and her mother-in-law finally finish planting all of the fields, the neighbors sneak in and destroy their work. When Yukie mourns the vandalism, Noge's father finally accepts her and his son is redeemed in his eyes. At the end of the war, Professor Yagihara is reinstated and Noge is honored for his anti-war efforts. Yukie returns to Kyoto to visit her parents. Yukie's mother invites her to stay since it seems her daughter has achieved her goal: Noge's parents are no longer ashamed of their son. However, Yukie now feels more comfortable planting rice than playing the piano and sees the value in the social work that still must be done in the village (obliquely referencing occupation-era reforms like land reform and women's enfranchisement), so she returns to Noge's parents.\n\nCast\nBackground\nAfter the surrender of Japan, the newly established Civil Information and Education Division set guidelines for the making of \"democratization films\", encouraging topics including the emancipation of women, civil rights, and the condemnation of militarists and war profiteers. Producer and co-writer Keiji Matsuzaki had been a student of Professor Takigawa at Kyoto University and wanted to produce a film based on the Takigawa incident. Matsuzaki worked on the storyline with Eijiro Hisaita and Akira Kurosawa, then travelled to Kyoto in December 1945 to interview the people involved in the incident. The opening titles of the film, giving the background of the incident, originally mentioned the responsibility of Ichir\u014d Hatoyama, former Minister of Education. Kurosawa later explained \"the Toho company told me to delete [Hatoyama\u2019s name] because it would have been upsetting\".\nThe completed film was markedly different from the Hisaita's original script, which Kurosawa considered superior. The production administration committee of the Toho labor union considered the script too similar to a script by newcomer Kiyoshi Kusuda, also based on the case of Hotsumi Ozaki. Kurosawa was forced to rewrite to latter half of the film, and was indignant when the committee recanted after the film was finished. The film was released on October 29, 1946, when the labor union was on strike, and management made the decision to release the film in Nikkatsu theatres, over the protests of the filmmakers.\n\nReception\nNo Regrets for Our Youth was received enthusiastically by post-war audiences and was ranked as the second best film of 1946 by Kinema Jumpo. David Conde of the Civil Information and Education Section considered the film the best among those he had been involved in.  However, many critics considered the character of Yukie to be too eccentric, exaggerated and inhuman.\nIn The Films of Akira Kurosawa, Donald Richie lists No Regrets for Our Youth as the first of Kurosawa's films that he considers \"perfect\", and argues that Japanese critics resented the film's uncompromising individualist message. In addition, Richie argues that the depiction of both the military and peasants as antagonists as evidence for Kurosawa's \"political uninvolvement\" with both the right-wing and left-wing. Mitsuhiro Yoshimoto rejects Richie's characterization of the film as apolitical in light of the involvement of the Civil Information and Education Section in film production, Hisaita and Matsuzaki's prewar involvement in the proletarian art movement, and Matsuzaki's personal interest in the Takigawa incident. \nNagisa \u014cshima was profoundly affected by No Regrets for Our Youth as a teenager, but later criticized the film for transforming the historical figures of Ozaki, a communist, and Takigawa, who opposed post-war student movements, into staunch defenders of liberalism, and for its false depiction of united resistance during the Kyoto University incident, which in reality was \"a history of schisms, submissions, and conversions after conversions\". \u014cshima argues that the film ultimately absolves the Japanese people of their responsibility for wartime militarism.\n\nReissues\nThe Criterion Collection has released No Regrets for Our Youth on DVD in North America as part of two Kurosawa-centered box sets; 2008's Postwar Kurosawa, the seventh entry in their Eclipse series, and 2009's AK 100: 25 Films by Akira Kurosawa.\n\nSee also\nJapanese resistance during the Sh\u014dwa period\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nYoshimoto, Mitsuhiro (2000).

It was released for PlayStation 4 in February 2017, and was published by Sony Interactive Entertainment internationally, and by Koei Tecmo in Japan. An edition for PlayStation 4 and Windows, containing the game's downloadable content, was released on November 7, 2017 by Koei Tecmo. A remastered version was released for PlayStation 5 on February 5, 2021.\nSet during a fictionalized version of the year 1600, the plot follows the journeys of William Adams, an Irish sailor named after and inspired by the historic William Adams, an Englishman who became a samurai. Adams pursues the sorcerer Edward Kelley into the final battles of the Sengoku period during Tokugawa Ieyasu's efforts to unify Japan, an effort complicated by the emergence of y\u014dkai that are flourishing in the chaos of war. Gameplay revolves around navigating levels and defeating monsters that have infested an area; combat revolves around stamina or \"Ki\" management and different sword stances that are strong or weak against different enemies.\nNioh began development in 2004 for PlayStation 3 as part of a multimedia project based on an unfinished Akira Kurosawa script. The project went through a turbulent and prolonged pre-production period, going through multiple revisions until its final version began development in 2014 for PlayStation 4. The story was based on the life of Western samurai William Adams, though it was embellished with supernatural elements. Development information was sporadic until 2015, when it was reintroduced to the public.\nAlpha and beta demos were released during 2016, to both gauge public reaction to the title and make adjustments based on feedback. Initially scheduled for a 2016 release, the adjustments pushed the release into the following year. Upon release, Nioh received positive reviews, with praise going to the gameplay and graphics while the story was criticized as lacking or confusing. It reached high positions in sales charts, going on to ship over 3 million copies worldwide. A follow-up, Nioh 2, was released in 2020.\n\nGameplay\nNioh is an action role-playing game set in Japan during the year 1600, with players taking the role of an Irish samurai named William. The player guides William on missions through enclosed environments fighting both human enemies and supernatural beings called yokai: missions are self-contained, hold alternate routes William can navigate, and selected from a menu rather than reached by navigating an open world. While navigating environments, William can find various collectables both in crates scattered through the environment and in other places within the environments such as fallen soldiers. These collectibles include Amrita, the game's experience points (EXP); gold, the in-game currency; weapons and armor, and consumable items such as bombs. Weapons and armor found in the environment can be taken to a blacksmith, who are able to buy it from William or can break it down into base material. Shrines scattered through levels act as checkpoints, allowing players to save progress, replenish health and raise William's experience level through accrued EXP: doing this respawns all normal enemies within an area. Skill points acquired in combat are assigned at shrines.\nFighting is fast-paced hack and slash combat (similar to previous Team Ninja works), with William being able to attack enemies and block their attacks in turn. William can run, dodge, and sprint with these and combat actions draining his Ki stamina bar. When his Ki has been depleted, William is left vulnerable to attack. If timed right, William is able to replenish lost Ki with an action called \"Ki pulse\". The Ki pulse grants status buffs onto William, and dispels patches of miasma generated by yokai and other supernatural enemies which rapidly saps Ki. Defeated enemies drop loot, which includes money and weapons. The speed at which William can move through levels depends on the weight of his equipped armor; the heavier it is, the faster his Ki will drain. If William dies, all the EXP acquired up to that point is left where he fell, and he must travel back to retrieve it, but if he dies again and therefore failing to reach it, the amount of EXP dropped is lost and the spirit animal is automatically recovered.\nWilliam has access to multiple types of melee weapons: these include single and dual swords, axes, polearms and kusarigama. In addition to melee weapons, William has access to ranged weapons such as a bow, a rifle, and a hand cannon. The more each weapon is used, the stronger and more effective it becomes. In combat, William can change between three Stances with melee weapons, with each stance having different effects; High Stance causes higher damage while lowering defense, Low Stance allows for quick attacks and better defense, while Middle Stance balances elements of the other two Stances. These Stances consume different amounts of Ki depending on their attack strength. William can summon Guardian Spirits, animals that combine his health and Ki into a single meter with added stat boosts such as increasing attack power or defense. Each Guardian Spirit boosts different stats, and can only be switched out at shrines. Guardian Spirits are lost when William dies, but they can be summoned to him at a shrine at the cost of his lost EXP. In addition to normal enemies, William can summon Revenants, hostile ghosts based on other fallen players, to battle and gain experience, money and items. A cooperative multiplayer allows for other players to be summoned to help in battles.\nWilliam's character growth is governed by EXP. Some statistical points can be assigned to William's character following the game's opening mission, and during the main game, stat points can be assigned to William's attributes, which range from increased physical strength to heightened speed. Stat points are split between three skill trees: \"Samurai\" for weapon skill trees for standard melee combat, \"Ninja\" for distance weapons such as shurikens and poisons, and \"Onmyo\" which link to the creation of talismans, consumable items that grant temporary stat boosts. If William finds and guides Kodama to the Shrines within each mission, he can purchase otherwise inaccessible bonus material such as items and weapons. Offerings of items can be made at the shrine in exchange for EXP. Additional buffs can be granted using Prestige Points, which are acquired by fulfilling certain tasks within levels such as dealing a certain amount of damage or killing a number of enemies with one weapon type.\n\nSynopsis\nSetting and characters\nNioh is set in 1600 within a fictionalized dark fantasy version of the late Sengoku period, a time when the clans of Japan were at war prior to the unification under the Tokugawa shogunate and the beginning of the Edo period. Amidst the fighting and high death toll, y\u014dkai have appeared and begun wreaking havoc across the land: major y\u014dkai threats that appear in the game include Hinoenma, Jor\u014dgumo, and a Yuki-onna born from the spirit of the wife of Oda Nobunaga following the Honn\u014d-ji incident.\nThe game's main protagonist is William Adams (Ben Peel), a blond-haired Irishman who arrives in Japan in pursuit of an enemy. He crosses paths with Tokugawa Ieyasu (Masachika Ichimura) and his ninja servant Hattori Hanz\u014d (Toshiyuki Morikawa), forming an alliance against both William's enemy and the y\u014dkai infesting Japan. William is trained in combat by Yagy\u016b Munetoshi, H\u014dz\u014din In'ei and Marume Nagayoshi. The main antagonist is Edward Kelley (Hiroyuki Kinoshita\/Nicholas Boulton), a Westerner driving the conflict using his dark alchemical abilities under the order of John Dee (Timothy Watson), chief advisor to Queen Elizabeth I.\nWilliam crosses paths with numerous historical figures from the period: these include Ieyasu's allies Ii Naomasa (Jun Fukuyama) and Honda Tadakatsu (Tessh\u014d Genda); daimyo Kuroda Yoshitaka (Y\u014dhei Tadano) and his son Kuroda Nagamasa (Hiroshi Tsuchida); Ieyasu's main rival Ishida Mitsunari (Takahiro Sakurai) and his allies Shima Sakon (Keiji Fujiwara) and \u014ctani Yoshitsugu (Kenyuu Horiuchi); Tachibana Ginchiyo (Shizuka It\u014d), head of the Tachibana clan, and her husband Muneshige (Eiji Hanawa); hostile mercenary Suzuki Magoichi (Yasuyuki Kase); Yasuke (Richie Campbell), a former favored vassal of Nobunaga; the Date clan including Date Masamune, Date Shigezane and Katakura Shigenaga; Sanada Yukimura, Sarutobi Sasuke and the Sanada Ten Braves; and Tenkai (Takayuki Sug\u014d), a monk of the Tendai Buddhist sect and master manipulator of yin and yang magic. Original characters include Okatsu (Emi Takei), a female ninja in Hanz\u014d's clan who holds a dislike and curiosity for William; and Fuku (Risa Shimizu), Tenkai's disciple.\n\nPlot\nThe game opens with a narration by William describing Amrita, a mystical golden stone found in abundance in Japan that is sought by the government of Queen Elizabeth I to secure victory over Spain in the Anglo-Spanish War. William was one of those contracted by the queen to obtain Amrita, but afterward was imprisoned to keep the Amrita a secret. Held in the Tower of London in 1598, William breaks out with the help of his Spirit Guardian Saoirse, a water spirit born from the prayers of his village who saved him from death when he was a boy and prevents him from dying. William is confronted by Edward Kelley, who seeks Japan's Amrita. After trying to kill William, Kelley uses his Ouroboros spirit to steal Saoirse and transports himself to Japan with William in pursuit. Landing in Japan in 1600, he fights Oni that are ravaging the area, receiving aid from Hanzo Hattori to help find Kelley in exchange for fighting Oni. On one of his first missions, William is joined by a Nekomata, who tells him that the delicate balance between good and evil spirits has been disrupted by the past century of war in Japan. Possession by Nekomata allows him to understand Japanese.\nWilliam's work against the y\u014dkai and saving key figures earns him Ieyasu's favour, while Mitsunari and his supporters align themselves with Kelley, in hopes that Mitsunari can create a land not wholly ruled by the strong. William, however, soon learns from Okatsu that Ieyasu sacrificed many of his family in a ruthless bid for power, with Okatsu being one of Ieyasu's illegitimate daughters who escaped by becoming a kunoichi. Kelley continues to plague William, including impersonating Tachibana Muneshige in an attempt to undermine Muneshige's wife Ginchiyo and resurrecting Oda Nobunaga's wife Princess N\u014d, as a yukionna. Kelley later drains an Amrita seal keeping evil spirits from ravaging Kyoto, with William barely stopping the spirits with help from Tenkai, his apprentice Fuku and the Nekomata, who sacrifices itself to give the others time to restore the seal. A later encounter sees William saving Okatsu from Kelley's control, then escaping with her when Ieyasu arrives and Kelley attacks, though William is initially disturbed that Ieyasu is willing to let Okatsu die. But upon realizing that Ieyasu is secretly pained by his ruthless decisions and sacrifices, William ultimately chooses to continue aiding him.\nEvents come to a head during the Battle of Sekigahara, where William faces off against first \u014ctani Yoshitsugu\u2014who uses Kelley's alchemy to empower his weakened body\u2014and Shima Sakon. With Sakon defeated and Mitsunari's army routed by Ieyasu's forces, Kelley convinces Mitsunari to allow a ritual to offer the lives of his 300 men to animate a Gashadokuro that William defeats with help from Hattori and Tenkai. Ieyasu has William pursue Mitsunari, fighting him when Kelley transforms him into a y\u014dkai-hybrid before returning him to human form, resulting in his capture by Ieyasu's forces and Tenkai being revealed as Akechi Mitsuhide. William pursues Kelley to a hideout where he disrupts his attempts to resurrect Nobunaga, Kelley flees while Nobunaga's close friend, Yasuke, duels William who defeats him. William heads to confront Kelley in Nobunaga's reconstructed castle, being subdued by Nobunaga's resurrected form before Nobunaga rebels against Kelley's control. Cornered and defeated, Kelley uses Ouroboros and Saoirse's energy to resurrect Yamata no Orochi. William defeats it, then learns from the dying Kelley that he was gathering Amrita to be sent back to England for his master John Dee. Having reclaimed Saoirse, William decides to disappear, allowing Hattori to avoid killing him on Ieyasu's orders and report him dead. This saddens Okatsu, who had begun to care for him and thought him different from other samurai. Following Mitsunari's execution, Ieyasu establishes his family's rule, setting the Edo period in motion as an era ruled by humans and hiding the truth of the y\u014dkai and William's involvement. Hanzo lies to Ieyasu that William is dead, but as he and Okatsu leaves, Ieyasu is revealed to not only be aware of William's survival, but also secretly pleased with the outcome.\nThree years later, William returns to England to confront Dee, also discovering that Edward Kelley was just one of several similar homunculi created by the latter. When William refuses Dee's offer of a partnership to guide England towards world conquest following the death of Elizabeth I, the chief advisor activates an elevator around his chamber, bringing William and himself into a secret tower where massive stores of Amrita are seen, Dee then absorbs energy from the crystals and transforms into a monstrous apparition known as Hundred Eyes. William defeats Dee, blinding him and thus neutering his magical abilities. Before leaving, William notices one of Hundred Eyes' magical orbs, and after receiving a vision of Hattori's death at the Siege of Osaka, decides to return to Japan.\nThe story is continued through downloadable content (DLC)\n\nDragon Of The North\nThe first DLC sees William returning to Japan where he is reunited with the resurrected Nekomata and learns from Ieyasu that Hanzo has gone missing while investigating warlord Date Masamune, who is secretly plotting a rebellion against the Tokugawa shogunate using an army of y\u014dkai. William eventually rescues Hanzo from the Date forces while convincing Masamune to give up his plot, learning that Masamune was supplied Amrita by a Spanish spy named Maria, who escapes and offers her services to Toyotomi Hideyori, as a means to create more chaos in Japan to capture and use the Amrita to help the Spanish Empire regain its status as a world power after its crippling naval defeat to England.\n\nDefiant Honor\/Bloodshed's End\nThe second and third DLCs focus on William's hunt for Maria while helping the Tokugawa army deal with Sanada Yukimura during the Siege of Osaka. Defiant Honor takes place during the Winter campaign of the Siege, with William joining the battle alongside Masamune's forces and manages to infiltrate the Sanada-maru, eventually clashing blades with Yukimura himself. The battle ended, however, when Lady Chacha signals for a truce, having been convinced by Maria to use the Amrita after she failed to do the same with Yukimura. Bloodshed's End takes place during the Summer campaign, where William once again penetrates the Sanada-maru and defeats Hideyori, revealed to be a golem created from Amrita. Joined by Yukimura, who had his ninja vassal Sarutobi Sasuke assume his identity to fake his death during the Battle of Tenn\u014dji, William confronts Maria, who escapes, and Chacha as she transforms into a Nine-Tailed Fox demon in an attempt to kill them. Defeated and fatally wounded, Chacha regains her senses and apologizes to Yukimura, who remains by her side as Osaka Castle is consumed in flames as the Genna Era begins. As Maria remains a threat, William and Hanzo continue their hunt for her.\n\nDevelopment\nNioh was developed by Team Ninja, a division of the game's publisher Koei Tecmo who had previously developed the Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive series. It is co-directed by Fumihiko Yasuda and Yosuke Hayashi, and co-produced by Kou Shibusawa and Hisashi Koinuma. The opening movie was directed by Shinji Higuchi, whose work included Shin Godzilla. The cinematic director for the game in general was Makoto Kamiya, who had previously supervised special effects for Death Note: Light Up the New World and the film version of I Am a Hero. The music was composed by Yugo Kanno, whose previous work included the Bayside Shakedown television film series and Japan Studio's Rain. The concept for the game was created by Shibusawa, who throughout development held a passionate vision for the project, which was in turn affecting its development.\n\nPre-production\nThe original version of Nioh was based on Oni, an unfinished script by Japanese film director Akira Kurosawa. According to Yasuda, this initial version \"just crashed\", and the team had to start all over again. The only elements to survive into the final version were the setting, the protagonist being a blond-haired foreigner, and the basic scenario concept: the narrative was otherwise changed into an original story based around the life of William Adams, an Englishman who became a samurai serving Ieyasu, and the events of the Sengoku period. While the original Kurosawa script was dropped in favor of an original story, artistic elements and battle movements were inspired by other Kurosawa pictures such as Yojimbo and Seven Samurai. The earliest draft of the new original story, created by the scenario writers of the Kessen series, gave the main character a leading yet unrecorded role in the events of the Sengoku period. This version was almost entirely scrapped.\nDevelopment on the title first began in 2004, when it was designed as a traditional Japanese role-playing game. It was being developed internally by Koei, four years prior to its 2008 merger with Tecmo. Development of this initial version ran from 2004 to 2008, lasting approximately four years before all work up to that point was scrapped. The role-playing version was scrapped by Shibusawa as it did not have enough fun elements within it. Production was rebooted and transferred to Omega Force, a division of Koei Tecmo, and shifted in genre to a fast-paced action game similar to their Dynasty Warriors series. This version was also scrapped, again due to Shibusawa being dissatisfied with the project's direction.\nTeam Ninja were first brought on in 2010 to help develop the action gameplay. It was at this stage that the title began evolving into an action role-playing game. When first presented with the project by the Koei staff, Team Ninja were skeptical about the project, unsure of its Western protagonist and setting, wondering if it was intended to be another Dynasty Warriors-styled game.  Development was fully transferred to Team Ninja in 2012, with subsequent production lasting around four years. Up to this stage, only the basic concepts had been finalized, but when Team Ninja began full development the project solidified into being a full action title. Team Ninja's staff handled the gameplay aspects, while earlier staff from the original Koei team handled the scenario.\nThe alpha version was completed in August 2012. The team originally used the Ninja Gaiden engine, and Shibusawa was again concerned as he felt the game was turning into a Ninja Gaiden clone; a cited example was a scene where William was swinging an enemy with his bare hands. Yasuda was brought on board around this time. Hayashi struggled to make the gameplay work for a samurai character, and after half a year halted development again. When Koei Tecmo began producing games for the PlayStation 4, Shibusawa and Koei Tecmo CEO Hisashi Suganuma asked Hayashi to develop Nioh for that platform. Once details had been confirmed, this version took three years to develop. In total, the project was in development for between twelve and thirteen years. Shibusawa said fan expectations of the game in Japan were the only reason the game was not cancelled.\n\nScenario\nOnce production of the game was confirmed in 2014, Shibusawa said the team needed to reexamine the planned narrative. During early talks, Yasuda and Hayashi disagreed about what type of narrative they wanted, as Yasuda wanted to make something closer to Ninja Gaiden and Hayashi wanted a sombre experience based around war and death. The focus on death was drawn both from the setting and lore surrounding the Bushido samurai code. The game's opening in the Tower of London, which had a sinister reputation and folklore surrounding it, played into that theme. The overall theme of the game was the cycle of life and death, which was represented by both William and the enemy yokai. Yasuda was responsible for the yokai hunting aspects of the narrative, something Hayashi strongly opposed.\nWhile a Western main character was settled upon for the final game, the initial concept had a native Samurai as the main protagonist in an original story. As the Koei staff had a history of developing historical titles such as Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Nobunaga's Ambition, they decided to base it on historical events. The Sengoku period was chosen as the game's setting due to it being a fertile period in Japanese history for an action title. Shibusawa was also fascinated by Adams' exploits, and the story came to be based on the major events in his life and iterations within Japan, then an isolated nation. They also added fantastic elements such as yokai.\nA major influence on the story was James Clavell's 1975 novel Sh\u014dgun, which focused on a fictional English samurai based on the real-life Adams. The character of William was initially conceived as a Western pirate who became a samurai, then shifted into his current form. His general design changed little during production, but minor details were altered over the years. The game's singular focus on death contrasted sharply with Team Ninja's earlier works, which had also incorporated mild erotic elements. At the management's insistence, brighter or comedic elements such as the kodama were added.\nA notable element of the story was the casting of high-profile actors in the lead roles, with many providing both voices and motion capture. The team wanted to bring the characters to life and fully express the historical aspects of the narrative. While the Koei staff had a strong background in games using historical figures, they had focused more on stylish presentation than subtle expressions during story sections. While the majority of the cast spoke Japanese, William spoke English. Initially this was to have been reversed, but the team thought it unrealistic even within the team's fantastical take on the setting, so they adjusted it. It also represented how William could communicate well with others despite a language barrier.\n\nGame design\nWhen Team Ninja were first involved with the project, they performed much trial and error testing to find a gameplay style best suited to the game's tone. When the project was given to Team Ninja, Shibusawa told them \"to complete the mission of creating Nioh\". The decision to give the project to Team Ninja was heavily influenced by the success of Dark Souls and other similar titles, dubbed by some as \"Masocore\" due to their difficult, yet rewarding action gameplay. Many at Team Ninja were fans of the Dark Souls series, and credited their surge in popularity with saving Nioh from possible cancellation and allowing progress for development of the game. Other influences included Bloodborne, Ninja Gaiden, Onimusha and Diablo. The main aim for the developers was to emulate the tough gameplay of both the Souls series and their earlier work on Ninja Gaiden while also making it accessible, fair and rewarding for players. Rather than outsourcing an engine or carrying an engine over from one of their other properties, the game engine for Nioh was built from scratch.\nWhile the combat was extensively influenced by Souls games, Team Ninja's use of loot was more heavily influenced by the Diablo series, as they wanted combat to revolve around player skill rather than gear acquired through combat. The gameplay incorporated elements of samurai combat from popular culture. Historical accuracy when it came to weapons, armor and fighting styles dominated the gameplay design, which resulted in shields not being added as they were not used in combat by samurai. Each boss, from yokai to human enemies, had their own appearances and tactics. The yokai were all drawn from Japanese folklore, although their designs underwent slight alterations from their original forms. A recurring element for the yokai bosses was how they were designed: first they decided the initial form and impression, then the developers added an element which would catch players off guard: for instance, if a yokai appeared beautiful, they would become ugly at some point during the battle.\n\nRelease\nNioh was first announced by original developer Koei in 2004 under its working title \"Oni\". In addition to the game, which was slated for a 2006 release, a feature film directed by Kurosawa's son Hisao Kurosawa would be produced alongside and inspire the game: the entire project's budget was estimated as being three billion yen. The movie tie-in was eventually cancelled in 2005 due to unspecified production problems, with the game becoming a standalone project. Nioh was first shown off in a trailer at the 2005 Electronic Entertainment Expo, where it was announced as a PlayStation 3 exclusive. At the time, the title was romanized as \"Ni-Oh\". Initially slated for a 2006 release, Nioh missed its announced release date, and no update on the game was issued until 2009, when Koei Tecmo stated that the title was still in development. Similar updates would be issued over the following six years. The game, now retitled slightly as Nioh, was reintroduced at the 2015 Tokyo Game Show as a PlayStation 4 exclusive, with a scheduled launch in Japan in 2016. It was later announced for an international release at the PlayStation Experience event in December of that year, also in 2016. A manga based on the character and setting, called Nioh: The Golden Samurai (\u4ec1\u738b\uff5e\u91d1\u8272\u306e\u4f8d\uff5e, Ni\u014d: Kin'iro no Samurai), was written by Yosuke Katayama and began serialization in Weekly Sh\u014dnen Magazine starting in May 2016.\nInitially planned for October 2016, the game was delayed to make final adjustments based on player feedback from demos. The localization was a high priority for Koei Tecmo due to the worldwide release date. The game was announced for a worldwide release in February 2017. While Koei Tecmo published the game in Japan, Sony Interactive Entertainment handled publishing duties in mainland Asia, North America and Europe. This was to distribute the game to as wide an audience as possible. It was released in North America on 7 February, in Europe 8 February, and in Japan on 9 February. Two editions were created: the standard edition featuring the full game, and a Digital Deluxe Edition featuring an additional weapon pack, PS4 theme and season pass. Pre-order bonuses were additional costumes, based respectively on Japanese temple guardian statues and the samurai Sanada Yukimura. The game was also among those that supported the PlayStation 4 Pro model, with graphical enhancements enabling a smooth framerate.\n\nMerchandise\nA manga based on the character and setting, called Nioh: The Golden Samurai (\u4ec1\u738b\uff5e\u91d1\u8272\u306e\u4f8d\uff5e, Ni\u014d: Kin'iro no Samurai), was written by Yosuke Katayama and began serialization in Weekly Sh\u014dnen Magazine starting in May 2016. The manga ran for twelve issues until May 2017. It was collected into three tank\u014dbon released between February and May 2017 by Kodansha. An official soundtrack, featuring all 45 pieces of music from the game, was released in Japan on February 15.\n\nDemos\nA demo version of the game, dubbed the \"alpha demo\", was released on PlayStation Network (PSN) on 26 April 2016. The demo was available until 5 May. Completing the demo unlocked access to a free downloadable content (DLC) pack dubbed \"Mark of the Conqueror\". This demo was released so Team Ninja could receive feedback from a future online survey to improve the game's mechanics. The demo was downloaded by 850,000 people worldwide, and feedback was positive overall aside from recurring complaints about its lack of tutorials, high difficulty and awkward control scheme. Based on this, the team made a number of changes and tweaks to the gameplay. A second \"beta\" demo released from 23 August to 6 September. It featured new stages, additional weapons and revamped gameplay based on the feedback from the alpha demo. Like the alpha demo, downloading the beta demo gave free access to DLC content, this time a pack dubbed \"Mark of the Warrior\" alongside the original \"Mark of the Conqueror\" pack. They again undertook a survey of players, and made numerous adjustments and additions to the game based on this feedback. The game's delay from 2016 to 2017 was caused by these adjustments. A third demo, called \"Last Chance Trial\", was made available from 20 to 23 January in North America and Europe. It gave access to both prior DLC and a final reward for the full game.\nProducer Fumihiko Yasuda, at a presentation at Tokyo Game Show 2018, later attributed Nioh's success to the \"demo strategy\", saying that aside from getting feedback from users, the demos also had the aim of showing players they were being listened to, \"which they hoped would result in players being more supporting of the game\".\n\nReception\nNioh received \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator website Metacritic. Most critics praised the combat, difficulty, setting, use of Japanese folklore, and aesthetics as high points, as well as giving players the option to choose different graphical modes for the PS4 version; while the game's story and inventory management were met with some criticism. Eurogamer ranked the game 35th on their list of the \"Top 50 Games of 2017\", while Polygon ranked it 42nd on their list of the 50 best games of 2017. The game was nominated for \"Best PS4 Game\" in Destructoid's Game of the Year Awards 2017, and for \"Best PlayStation 4 Game\" and \"Best RPG\" in IGN's Best of 2017 Awards. Nioh was later one of three games invited to the Global Game Business Summit at Tokyo Game Show 2018 as an example of a game that succeeded globally.\nIn a review of Nioh in Black Gate, Matt Drought said \"I found Nioh to be a deeply engaging game that kept me coming back for the fun combat mechanics and to see the incredible enemies that inhabited this world.\"\n\nSales\nNioh opened at number 2 in the UK sales charts. Retailers Amazon and Walmart sold all their stock of Nioh within the first week of release. It sold 75,477 copies in its first week in Japan, entering the charts at number 2. On February 24, 2017 Koei Tecmo and Team Ninja announced that Nioh had shipped over one million units worldwide within its first two weeks of sale. The numbers included retail shipments and digital sales. By February 2020, the game had shipped over three million copies worldwide. In October 2022, the sales of both Nioh and Nioh 2 had exceeded seven million units worldwide.\n\nAccolades\nSequel\nOn June 11, 2018, at the 2018 Sony E3 conference, Nioh 2 was announced. It is a prequel to Nioh and was released for PlayStation 4 in March 2020.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website","134":"Nobuo Kaneko (\u91d1\u5b50\u4fe1\u96c4, Kaneko Nobuo, 27 March 1923 \u2013 20 January 1995) was a Japanese actor.

The film is written, produced, directed and edited by Hirokazu Kore-eda, and it stars Yuya Yagira, Ayu Kitaura, and Hiei Kimura.\nNobody Knows tells the story of four children: Akira, Ky\u014dko, Shigeru, and Yuki, who are aged between five and twelve years old. They are half-siblings, with each of them having different fathers. Because the three youngest children are in the apartment illegally without the landlord's knowledge or permission, they cannot go outside or be seen in the apartment, and they do not attend school. Their mother leaves them alone for weeks, and finally does not return. Forced over time to survive on their own, they can only rely on each other to face the multiple challenges in front of them.\nNobody Knows was first shown at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival on 12 May 2004. It was subsequently released in Japanese cinemas on 7 August 2004. The film received widespread critical acclaim, and it grossed over US$11 million worldwide. It won several awards, most notably Best Actor at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival as well as Best Film and Best Director awards at the 47th Blue Ribbon Awards. At the time Yuya Yagira became the youngest Best Actor winner in the history of the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nPlot\nA young mother and her four children move into a small apartment in Tokyo. Only the eldest, Akira, is known to the landlord; he and his mother Keiko smuggle the youngest boy and girl, Shigeru and Yuki, into the apartment inside suitcases. The elder sister, Ky\u014dko, comes separately by train. Each of the children has different fathers. Their mother does not allow them to go to school or be seen by others, and only Akira is allowed to go outside.\nAfter a few months, Keiko tells Akira that she has a new boyfriend, and that after she gets married, the children can lead normal lives, but Akira seems doubtful. Without warning, Keiko leaves home and is away for months, leaving only a small amount of money for the children. Akira is forced to take charge of paying the rent and other expenses and caring for his younger siblings. When they run out of money, Akira goes to see several men who may be Yuki's biological father and asks them for money. \nAt length, Keiko returns, bringing all the children gifts, but soon leaves again. Though she promises she will be back in time for Christmas, she breaks this promise, and the season changes to the New Year and then to spring without her returning, forcing Akira and Ky\u014dko into the roles of surrogate parents. Akira soon finds evidence that she has already married and left them forever, though he does not tell his siblings. Again running out of money, they are unable to pay their rent any longer and subsist on inexpensive food from the convenience store. On Yuki's birthday, she asks to go outside to wait for their mother at the train station. The siblings enjoy a day out together, and though their mother does not return, Akira promises Yuki that one day he will take her on the Tokyo Monorail to see the airplanes take off at Haneda Airport.\nAkira befriends two boys his own age at a game arcade who start frequenting the family's apartment, playing games and roughhousing, and he begins to neglect his siblings. The apartment is falling into disrepair with no one cleaning or keeping up with other chores. When Akira and the two boys go to the convenience store one day, they dare him to shoplift. Akira refuses, and the two boys leave him. Several months later, when the two have entered junior high school, Akira comes by their school and invites them over to play, but they refuse, and Akira overhears them saying that his house smells like garbage. In an apologetic gesture, Akira takes his siblings to a nearby park to play and buys them candy and toys at the convenience store. They start a garden on the veranda of the apartment, planting seeds from wildflowers inside instant noodle cups.\nEventually the electricity, gas, and water in the apartment are all turned off. The children start using the public park's toilet to wash themselves and the tap there for their water. On one of these visits, Shigeru starts a conversation with Saki, a high school student who is cutting class, which blossoms into a friendship between her and the siblings, and she begins to visit them and help Akira and Kyoko care for the family. However, when she tries to help Akira out of financial difficulties by offering him money obtained through enjo k\u014dsai, Akira rejects it and runs away.\nWith summer approaching, the children have little money and are growing weary. Akira goes out one day to watch a junior high school's baseball match. The team's coach spots him and, short a player, asks him to sub in. Akira joins the game and enjoys playing baseball. While he is away, Yuki falls from a stool while trying to reach for something and dies. Akira goes to find Saki again, finally accepting her offer of financial support, and they buy as many boxes as they can find of Yuki's favorite chocolate candies, which they place with Yuki's dead body in a suitcase. With Saki's help, Akira takes the suitcase to a field near Haneda Airport's runway. They sit and watch planes come in, and then he and Saki dig a grave and bury the suitcase. They then return to the apartment, and the film ends with Akira, Ky\u014dko, Shigeru, and Saki still together, walking home. Saki now has her hair in pigtails, almost like the longer pigtails Yuki used to wear.\n\nCast\nYuya Yagira as Akira Fukushima (\u798f\u5cf6\u660e), the eldest son, age twelve. According to his mother, his father worked at Haneda Airport. After their mother disappears, he becomes the surrogate head of the family and takes care of his siblings.\nAyu Kitaura as Ky\u014dko Fukushima (\u798f\u5cf6\u4eac\u5b50), the oldest daughter and the second-eldest child, eleven years old.

She takes charge of the laundry and other household chores.\nHiei Kimura as Shigeru Fukushima (\u798f\u5cf6\u8302), the younger son.

He also spent a very long time getting to know his subjects, and wanted the young cast members to interact, grow, and express their personalities freely, with as little adult dictation as possible. He did not use the usual structuring and cueing methods, but instead uses a discreet camera to show how children really live when no one is looking. Also, when the director discovered the actress Momoko Shimizu who played Yuki liked Apollo Choco more than Strawberry Pocky as was in the script, he changed his script to suit that and made her smile brighter. He chose not to make it a \"feel-good\" movie even though similar Japanese dramas often are. He avoided sentiment, aiming for a more stoic picture. This is because he wanted the audience to \"take away something\" from the film.\n\nPre-production\nThe director Hirokazu Kore-eda held extensive auditions to cast the four children, and the actors were all nonprofessionals. Also, during the casting, a little girl came in with noisy sandals. The director liked it so much that he brought it over to Yuki's character when searching for her mother. He also did not give the children detailed explanations of their roles, because he wanted them to be natural.\n\nFilming\nThe filming took over a year, lasting from autumn 2002 to summer 2003. The reel was filmed chronologically and 70% of the story was set in a cramped Tokyo apartment (with every room built specifically for the film). The apartment was specially rented for a year for the filming of this film, and the filming assistants lived in the apartment when it was not used for filming. Director Hirokazu Kore-eda said that during the long filming period, he tried to build a relationship of trust between himself and the children, and also amongst the children themselves. During the children's filming breaks, the children were asked to write in their own journal entries about what they were thinking, ranging from the film to their own everyday concerns.\n\nPost-production\nNobody Knows held its first public screening at the Le Theatre in Ginza, Tokyo on June 30, 2004 after the film debuted at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nMusic\nThe soundtrack for the movie was written by the Japanese guitar duo Gontiti.\nThe ending song, \"H\u014dseki\", was sung by Takako Tate, who also appears in the film.\n\nRelease\nFilm festivals\nNobody Knows competed for the Palme d'Or at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival on 12 May 2004.\n\nHome media\nA DVD of Nobody Knows was released in Japan on 11 March 2005. It was released in DVD (region 2) format, and it has both English and Japanese subtitles. Separately, the Making of Nobody Knows DVD, which contains 41 minutes' worth of film taken during the filming of Nobody Knows, was released on 23 December 2004.\n\nReception\nCritical reception\nNobody Knows has received widespread acclaim from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 93% based on 94 reviews, with an average ratings of 8\/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Tragic and haunting, a beautifully heart-wrenching portrait of child abandonment.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 88 out of 100, with all 31 critics giving positive reviews.\nThe Japan Times gave the film a rating of four out of five. The reviewer Mark Schilling describes the film's young actors as \"superb\", and said that the film \"faithfully reflects the fabric of the children's lives over the course of a year\". The New York Times says that the film is \"too naturalistic, and too disturbing, to be a movie for children, but it nonetheless engages the audience's wondering, childlike imagination as well as its worrying adult conscience\". It further adds that \"It is also strangely thrilling, not only because of the quiet assurance of Mr. Kore-eda's direction, but also because of his alert, humane sense of sympathy\".\nIn a 2013 review of a later film by Kore-eda, Andrew Schenker of Slant Magazine referred to Nobody Knows as the director's best film.\n\nAccolades\nY\u016bya Yagira won the award for Best Actor at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. He was the first Japanese actor to win this category at the Cannes. The film had also won the \"Best One\" award for Japanese film at the 78th Kinema Junpo Ten Best awards. At the same award ceremony, You won the best supporting actress and Y\u016bya Yagira won the best new actor award.\nAt the 47th Blue Ribbon Awards, Nobody Knows won the best film award. Director Hirokazu Kore-eda also won the \"Best Director\" award.\nThe film received the Grand Prix for Best Film at Film Fest Gent in 2004.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website (in Japanese)\nInterview of Hirokazu Kore-Eda about the film\nReview of Nobody Knows at Postscript Magazine\nJapanese Movie Database (in Japanese)\nMartonova, A.

He is known for his films Shirley Adams (2009), Beauty (2011), The Endless River (2015), Moffie (2019), and Living (2022). Beauty won the Queer Palm Award at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nEarly life and career\nHermanus was born in Cape Town and moved to Plettenberg Bay when he was three. He grew up in a house his father built in the hills, as his 'coloured' family was not permitted to live in the town centre under Apartheid. His parents were ANC activists. His family buried banned books in the garden, ignored segregated beaches, and homeschooled his older siblings. They commuted to school nearby in the Eastern Cape.\nHermanus graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Film, Media, and Visual Studies from the University of Cape Town. He initially worked as a press photographer for the Cape Argus newspaper. While working for \"The Argus\", a mutual friend introduced Hermanus to award-winning German director Roland Emmerich who played a crucial role in Hermanus's career by giving him a private scholarship to attend the London Film School, where he earned his master's degree in film. Emmerich helped Hermanus make his first feature film, \"Shirley Adams\".\n\nFilms\nShirley Adams\nShirley Adams, Hermanus's first film, released in 2009, relates the story of a single mother raising her paraplegic son, who was injured during a gang fight. Hermanus has stated that he got the idea for the film from his sister, an occupational therapist, who told him the story of a teenage boy paralysed in a shooting incident.\nShirley Adams premiered at the Durban International Film Festival in 2009 where the film received awards for Best South African Film, Best First Film, and Best Actress for Denise Newman. The film was shown in competition at the Locarno Film Festival and was also shown at the Toronto International Film Festival. The film also won awards for Best Film and Best Director at the 2009 South African Film and Television Awards.\n\nBeauty\nBeauty (known as Skoonheid in Afrikaans) was the fifth South African movie to be selected for competition at the Cannes Film Festival and the first in Afrikaans. The film won the 2011 Queer Palm Award for best picture, and Hermanus won the 2012 South African Film and Television Award (SAFTA) for Best Director. Lead actor Deon Lotz won the 2012 SAFTA for Best Actor in a Feature Film for his role in Beauty, as well as Best Actor at the Zurich Film Festival. Beauty was also part of the Official Selection 2011 for the Prize Un Certain Regard at the Cannes Film Festival.\nBeauty relates the story of Fran\u00e7ois, a married, closeted, middle-aged Afrikaner, who becomes obsessed with a handsome young lawyer, Christian (played by Charlie Keegan), the son of one of his friends. Beauty was critically praised for being an \"unvarnished study of the turbulence of the middle-aged male psyche, but it also addresses the current Afrikaner condition\". Another critic noted that the film's original title, Skoonheid, \". . . means 'beauty' in Afrikaans but literally translates as 'cleanliness' . . . is a story about the ugly truth of confronting parts of yourself that you hate and try to suppress\".\nSome reviewers and critics noted that the film's subject matter and visuals could be \"off-putting\" and \"graphic\". Hermanus stated that he was grateful that the film stirred debate. \"The debates on the gay issues are amazing, but I'm still yearning for the debate to start on other issues like repression and racial tensions in the movie\".\nHermanus was guest of honour at \"Side by Side,\" an international festival of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender film held in Moscow in April 2011. The filmmaker presented Beauty at the festival.\n\nThe Endless River\nIn 2015, Hermanus wrote and directed his third film, The Endless River. This film became the first South African film to compete for the Golden Lion award at the Venice Film Festival. Lead actress Crystal Donna Roberts also competed for the Best Actress award at the festival.\nThe film is set in the small town of Riviersonderend in the Overberg region of South Africa and relates the story of a French expatriate and a small-town waitress who form a bond after the brutal murder of his family on a farm. In describing Endless River, Hermanus explained, \"I wanted to combine in my film a place I'm familiar with the story of violence happening in South Africa\".\n\nMoffie\nMoffie had its world premiere at the Venice International Film Festival on 4 September 2019. The film is based on an autobiographical novel by South African writer Andr\u00e9 Carl van der Merwe, relating the author's experiences serving in the South African military during the Apartheid-era war in Angola. The lead character, Nicholas van der Swart (played by Kai Luke Br\u00fcmmer), and fellow recruit Stassen (Ryan de Villiers), share a mutual attraction but must make their sexuality invisible to avoid being viciously humiliated and brutalised.\nMoffie was one of three Southern African films submitted for consideration in the 2021 Golden Globe Awards Best Foreign Language Film category. Sidney was nominated for a 2021 British Academy Film Award (BAFTA) for Outstanding Debut; the film also received a BFI nomination for Best Film and won the Jury Prize at the 2020 Dublin International Film Festival. Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 90%, based on 94 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5\/10.\n\nLiving\nIn October 2020, it was announced that Hermanus would direct Living, his first non-South African film, starring Bill Nighy and Aimee Lou Wood. The film's screenplay was written by the Japanese\u2013British author Kazuo Ishiguro and is an adaptation of the 1952 Japanese film Ikiru. Living premiered at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival. and screened 2022 Venice Film Festival. The film received a number of accolades, including British Independent Film Award and British Academy Film Award nominations, as well as multiple acting nominations for Nighy. Nighy and Ishiguro then received Academy Award nominations in the acting and adapted screenplay categories respectively, making Living Hermanus' first film to receive Academy Award nominations.\n\nThe History of Sound\nAt the end of October 2021, it was announced Hermanus would adapt Ben Shattuck's short story starring Josh O'Connor and Paul Mescal. Hermanus had developed the script for The History of Sound with Shattuck himself during COVID-19 lockdown.\n\nTelevision\nFor his first television project, Hermanus is attached to direct and executive produce Mary & George, a miniseries starring Julianne Moore as Mary Villiers, Countess of Buckingham for Sky Studios in the UK and AMC in the US.\n\nFilmography\nPersonal life\nHermanus is gay.

It was made during the allied occupation of Japan and shows some of the challenges of life in early post-war Tokyo. The film is notable in the Kurosawa canon as the director's only shomin-geki, and because of a fourth wall-breaking scene at the climax. It is in black-and-white and runs 108 minutes.\n\nPlot\nYuzo and his fianc\u00e9e, Masako, meet in Tokyo on a Sunday for their weekly date. They are determined to have a nice day even though they only have thirty-five yen between them, but this is easier said than done: they hear about an apartment they hope to rent so they can live together, but find it is too expensive. Yuzo plays baseball with a group of children but accidentally damages a manj\u016b shop. They visit a club owned by someone Yuzo knew in the army, but cannot get in because the manager refuses to believe that someone dressed as shabbily as Yuzo could really know the owner. They go to the zoo, but it starts to rain and they have no umbrella, so they try to see a performance of Schubert's Unfinished Symphony only to find that ticket scalpers have already bought up all the cheap tickets to sell at a markup.\nThe unlucky lovers go back to the apartment Yuzo is sharing with a friend (who will be away until the evening), but Masako leaves after Yuzo angrily tries to force himself on her; forgetting her purse, they reconcile when she comes back for it. The rain stops, and they go to a caf\u00e9, where they are charged for two caf\u00e9 au lait, which are twice as expensive as the coffee they thought they had ordered. Yuzo gives his coat to the restaurant as collateral, promising to pay back the rest of the bill when he can afford it. Yuzo's spirits begin to lift as he and Masako talk about their dream of opening a \"caf\u00e9 for the masses\" with good food and drinks at reasonable prices; they even act out running their shop in an empty lot they pass by. Yuzo then takes Masako to an empty outdoor amphitheater, where he pantomimes conducting a performance of the Unfinished Symphony they were not able to see earlier in the day. After this, they part ways until the following Sunday.\n\nCast\nChieko Nakakita as Masako\nIsao Numasaki as Yuzo\nAtsushi Watanabe as Yamamoto\nZeko Nakamura as the dessert shop owner\nIchiro Sugai as Yamiya, the black-marketeer\nMasao Shimizu as the dance hall manager\nMidori Ariyama as Sono, Yamiya's mistress\nSachio Sakai as the ticket seller\n\nProduction\nOne Wonderful Sunday is seen as a variation on the shomin-geki genre. On the film's climatic fourth wall-breaking scene, where the character Masako turns to the camera with moist eyes and earnestly asks the audience to applaud so that Yuzo and her can hear the music they are imagining, Akira Kurosawa said he wanted to \"transform the audience into actual participants in the plot\". Although Japanese audiences sat motionless during the scene, creating an \"awkward empty space\" where Kurosawa intended engagement, the director later happily remarked that audiences in Paris applauded with enthusiasm.\n\nReissues\nThe Criterion Collection has released One Wonderful Sunday on DVD in North America as part of two Kurosawa-centered box sets; 2008's Postwar Kurosawa, the seventh entry in their Eclipse series, and 2009's AK 100: 25 Films by Akira Kurosawa.\n\nReception\nRita Kempley of The Washington Post called One Wonderful Sunday \"stylistically excessive, [and] wildly experimental\", but wrote it does presage the genius of Kurosawa's later works, \"with low tracking shots, characteristically close crops and obstructive scenery making their debut. It's like looking for footprints, tracking the master this apprentice was to become.\" David A. Conrad found One Wonderful Sunday to be one of many occupation-era Japanese films that parallel the more famous Italian neorealism movement, emphasizing poverty, hunger, weakening social mores, and urban dilapidation in the years after World War II.\n\nAwards\nMainichi Film Concours \u2013 \"Best Director\" and \"Best Screenplay\", 1948.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOne Wonderful Sunday at IMDb\nOne Wonderful Sunday at Allmovie\nOne Wonderful Sunday at Rotten Tomatoes\nOne Wonderful Sunday (in Japanese) at the Japanese Movie Database","141":"Our Homeland (\u304b\u305e\u304f\u306e\u304f\u306b, Kazoku no kuni) is a 2012 Japanese drama film about a Korean man's visit to his family in Japan after a long exile in North Korea.

The occupation, led by the American military with support from the British Commonwealth and under the supervision of the Far Eastern Commission, involved a total of nearly one million Allied soldiers. The occupation was overseen by the US General Douglas MacArthur, who was appointed Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers by the US President Harry S. Truman; MacArthur was succeeded as supreme commander by General Matthew Ridgway in 1951. Unlike in the occupations of Germany and Austria, the Soviet Union had little to no influence in Japan, declining to participate because it did not want to place Soviet troops under MacArthur's direct command.\nThis foreign presence marks the only time in the history of Japan that it has been occupied by a foreign power. However, unlike in Germany, the Allies never assumed direct control over Japan's civil administration. In the immediate aftermath of Japan's military surrender, the country's government continued to formally operate under the provisions of the Meiji Constitution. Furthermore, at General MacArthur's insistence, Emperor Hirohito remained on the imperial throne and was effectively granted full immunity from prosecution for war crimes after he agreed to replace the wartime cabinet with a ministry acceptable to the Allies and committed to implementing the terms of the Potsdam Declaration, which among other things called for the country to become a parliamentary democracy. Under MacArthur's guidance, the Japanese government introduced sweeping social reforms and implemented economic reforms that recalled American \"New Deal\" priorities of the 1930s under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1947, a sweeping amendment to the Meiji Constitution was passed that effectively repealed it in its entirety and replaced it with a new, American-written constitution, and the Emperor's theoretically vast powers, which for many centuries had been constrained only by conventions that had evolved over time, became strictly limited by law as a constitutional monarchy.\nWhile Article 9 of the constitution explicitly forbade Japan from maintaining a military or pursuing war as a means to settle international disputes, this policy soon became problematic especially as neighboring China fell under the control of the Chinese Communist Party and the Korean War broke out. As a result, the National Police Reserve (NPR) was founded in 1950. The NPR was reorganized into the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) in 1954, effectively completing the de facto remilitarization of Japan.\nThe occupation officially ended with the coming into force of the Treaty of San Francisco, signed on September 8, 1951, and effective from April 28, 1952, after which the US military ceased any direct involvement in the country's civil administration thus effectively restoring full sovereignty to Japan with the exception of the Ryukyu Islands (Okinawa Prefecture). The simultaneous implementation of the US-Japan Security Treaty (replaced by the revised treaty in 1960) allowed tens of thousands of American soldiers to remain based in Japan indefinitely, albeit at the invitation of the Japanese government and not as an occupation force.\nThe occupation of Japan can be usefully divided into three phases: the initial effort to punish and reform Japan; the so-called \"Reverse Course\" in which the focus shifted to suppressing dissent and reviving the Japanese economy to support the US in the Cold War as a country of the Western Bloc; and the final establishment of a formal peace treaty with the 48 Allies of the Second World War and an enduring military alliance with the United States.\n\nBackground\nInitial planning\nAmerican planning for a post-war occupation of Japan began as early as February 1942, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt established an Advisory Committee on Postwar Foreign Policy to advise him on the postwar reconstruction of Germany, Italy, and Japan (Axis powers). On matters related to Japan, this committee was later succeeded by the smaller Inter-Departmental Area Committee on the Far East (IDAFE), which met 234 times between the autumn of 1942 and the summer of 1945 and had frequent discussions with two US presidents, Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman.\nDuring the war, the Allied Powers had planned to divide Japan amongst themselves for the purposes of occupation, as was done for the Allied-occupied Germany. Under the final plan, however, Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP) was to be given direct control over the main islands of Japan (Honshu, Hokkaido, Shikoku, and Kyushu) and the immediately surrounding islands, while outlying possessions were divided between the Allied Powers as follows:\n\nSoviet Union: Northern Korea, South Sakhalin, and the Kuril Islands\nUnited States: Southern Korea, Okinawa Islands, the Amami Islands, the Ogasawara Islands and Japanese possessions in Micronesia\nChina: Taiwan and Penghu\nIn early August 1945, with Japan's surrender seeming probable, the US Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended to President Harry S. Truman that Pacific Theatre Commander General Douglas MacArthur be named Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP) to oversee the surrender and occupation of Japan. Truman agreed, and MacArthur asked his staff in Manila to begin making concrete preparations for the occupation of Japan.\nAs the Soviets moved in to occupy their allotted territories, some Japanese forces continued to resist even after the Japanese surrender. Such operations included final battles on the Kuril Islands and South Sakhalin well past the end of August in 1945. In the end, despite its initial hopes, the Soviet Union did not manage to occupy any part of the Japanese home islands, largely due to significant U.S. opposition that was backed by the leverage gained by its then newly realized status as the world's only nuclear-armed state.\nIn any case, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was not inclined to press the Americans very far following Japan's surrender. He was not willing to place Soviet troops under MacArthur's direct command. Furthermore, in terms of both strategic interests and prestige the Soviets had achieved most of their war aims in the Far East. Moreover, whereas China, Korea and Japan were all a considerable distance from the USSR's European heartland, Stalin regarded establishing a powerful buffer against further military threats from the west to be vital to the Soviet Union's future existence. He therefore placed a far greater priority on establishing Soviet communist influence in Europe rather than in Asia.\n\nJapanese surrender and initial landings\nFollowing the dropping of atomic bombs and the entry of the Soviet Union into the war against Japan, on the night of 9\u201310 August 1945, Emperor Hirohito announced his decision that the Japanese government should accept the terms demanded by the Allies in the Potsdam Declaration to Prime Minister Kantar\u014d Suzuki and his administration. On August 15, 1945, Emperor Hirohito announced Japan's surrender to the Japanese people in a nationwide radio broadcast. Two days after Japanese Emperor's first radio broadcast informing the surrender of Japan, Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni (a member of Japanese imperial family and father-in-law of Hirohito's eldest daughter, Shigeko Higashikuni) became first post-war Prime Minister on August 17, 1945.\nJapanese officials left for Manila on August 19 to meet MacArthur and to discuss surrender terms. On August 28, 1945, a week before the official surrender ceremony, 150 US personnel flew to Atsugi, Kanagawa Prefecture. They were followed by the USS Missouri, whose accompanying vessels landed the 4th Marine Regiment on the southern coast of Kanagawa. The 11th Airborne Division was airlifted from Okinawa to Atsugi Airdrome, 50 kilometres (30 mi) from Tokyo. Other Allied personnel followed.\nMacArthur arrived in Tokyo on August 30 and immediately decreed several laws. No Allied personnel were to assault Japanese people or eat the scarce Japanese food. Flying the Hinomaru (sun disc), national flag of Japan was initially severely restricted (although individuals and prefectural offices could apply for permission to fly it); this restriction was partially lifted in 1948 and completely lifted the following year.\nOn September 2, 1945, Japan formally surrendered with the signing of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender. On September 6, U.S. President Truman approved a document titled \"U.S. Initial Post-Surrender Policy for Japan\". The document set two main objectives for the occupation: eliminating Japan's war potential and turning Japan into a democratic nation with pro-United Nations orientation.\n\nSize and scope\nBy the end of 1945, around 430,000 American soldiers were stationed throughout Japan. Of the main Japanese islands, Kyushu was occupied by the 24th Infantry Division, with some responsibility for Shikoku. Honshu was occupied by the First Cavalry Division and Sixth Army. Hokkaido was occupied by the 77th Infantry and 11th Airborne Divisions. By the beginning of 1946, replacement troops began to arrive in the country in large numbers and were assigned to MacArthur's Eighth Army, headquartered in Tokyo's Dai-Ichi building. In total, including rotations of replacement troops throughout the seven years, nearly 1 million American soldiers would serve in the Occupation, in addition to thousands of civilian contractors and tens of thousands of dependents.\nThe American forces were supplemented by around 40,000 troops from the British Commonwealth. The official British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF), composed of Australian, British, Indian and New Zealand personnel, did not begin deployment to Japan until February 21, 1946. While U.S. forces were responsible for the overall occupation, BCOF was responsible for supervising demilitarization and the disposal of Japan's war industries. BCOF was also responsible for occupation of several western prefectures and had its headquarters at Kure. At its peak, the force numbered about 40,000 personnel. During 1947, BCOF began to decrease its activities in Japan, and officially wound up in 1951.\nThe Far Eastern Commission and Allied Council for Japan were also established to supervise the occupation of Japan. The establishment of a multilateral Allied council for Japan was proposed by the Soviet government as early as September 1945, and was supported partially by the British, French and Chinese governments.\n\nInitial phase\nThe initial phase of the Occupation focused on punishing Japan for having made war on the Allies, and undertook a thorough reformation of Japanese society to ensure that Japan would never again be a threat to world peace. Reforms targeted all major sectors of Japanese society, government, and economy. Historians have emphasized similarities to the American New Deal programs of the 1930s. Moore and Robinson note that, \"New Deal liberalism seemed natural, even to conservative Republicans such as MacArthur and Whitney.\"\n\nFeeding the starving populace\nBefore reforms could be undertaken, MacArthur's first priority was to set up a food distribution network. Following the collapse of the ruling government and the wholesale destruction of most major cities, virtually the entire Japanese populace was starving. The air raids on Japan's urban centers left millions displaced, and food shortages (created by bad harvests and the demands of the war) worsened when the seizure of foodstuffs from Korea, Taiwan, and China ceased. Repatriation of Japanese people living in other parts of Asia and hundreds of thousands of demobilized prisoners of war only aggravated the hunger problem in Japan, as these people put more strain on already scarce resources. Around 5.1 million Japanese returned to Japan in the fifteen months following October 1, 1945, and another million returned in 1947. As expressed by Kazuo Kawai, \"Democracy cannot be taught to a starving people\". Initially, the U.S. government provided emergency food relief through Government Aid and Relief in Occupied Areas (GARIOA) funds. In fiscal year 1946, this aid amounted to US$92 million in loans. From April 1946, under the guise of Licensed Agencies for Relief in Asia, private relief organizations were also permitted to provide relief. Even with these measures, millions of people were still on the brink of starvation for several years after the surrender.\n\nPreserving the Emperor\nOnce the food network was in place, MacArthur set out to win the support of Hirohito. The two men met for the first time on September 27, 1945; the photograph of the two together is one of the most famous in Japanese history. Some were shocked that MacArthur wore his standard duty uniform with no tie, instead of his dress uniform, when meeting the Emperor Hirohito. The difference in height between the towering MacArthur and the diminutive Hirohito also impressed upon Japanese citizens who was in charge now. With the cooperation of Japan's reigning monarch, MacArthur had the political ammunition he needed to begin the real work of the occupation. While other Allied political and military leaders pushed for Hirohito to be tried as a war criminal, MacArthur resisted such calls, arguing that any such prosecution would be overwhelmingly unpopular with the Japanese people. He also rejected calls for abdication, promoted by some members of the imperial family such as Takahito, Prince Mikasa (younger brother of Hirohito) and former prime minister Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni (Hirohito's eldest daughter, Princess Shigeko's father-in-law) and demands of intellectuals like Tatsuji Miyoshi.\n\nDisarmament and demobilization\nJapanese soldiers were rapidly disarmed and demobilized en masse. On September 15, 1945, the Japanese Imperial Headquarters was dissolved. By December, all Japanese military forces in the Japanese home islands were fully disbanded. Occupation forces also exploded or dumped into the sea over 2 million tons of unused munitions and other war materiel.\n\nRelease of political prisoners\nThe issuing of the Removal of Restrictions on Political, Civil, and Religious Liberties directive by SCAP on October 4, 1945, led to the abolition of the Peace Preservation Law and the release of all political prisoners. Japanese communists were released from jail, and the Japan Communist Party was granted legal status.\n\nDisestablishment of State Shinto\nOn December 15, 1945, the Shinto Directive was issued, abolishing Shinto as a state religion and prohibiting some of its teachings and rites that were deemed to be militaristic or ultra-nationalistic.\n\nTrade Union Act\nOn December 22, 1945, at SCAP's direction, the Diet passed Japan's first ever trade union law protecting the rights of workers to form or join a union, to organize, and take industrial action. There had been pre-war attempts to do so, but none that were successfully passed until the Allied occupation. A new Trade Union Law was passed on June 1, 1949, which remains in place to the present day. According to Article 1 of the Act, the purpose of the act is to \"elevate the status of workers by promoting their being on equal standing with the employer\".\n\nPurge of wartime public officials\nIn January 1946, SCAP issued directives calling for the purge of wartime officials from public offices. Individuals targeted in the purge included accused war criminals, military officers, leaders of ultranationalist societies, leaders in the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, business leaders involved in Japanese overseas economic expansion, governors of former Japanese colonies, and national leaders involved in the decisions leading Japan into war. Ultimately, SCAP screened a total of 717,415 possible purgees, and wound up excluding 201,815 of them from holding public office. However, as part of the \"Reverse Course\" in Occupation policy, most of the purgees would be de-purged and allowed to return to public life by 1951.\n\nEnfranchisement of women\nAfter Japan's surrender, women's leaders in Japan began calling for women's enfranchisement. In August 1945, Ichikawa Fusae (a leader of the pre-war women's suffrage movement) organized the Women's Committee to Cope with Postwar Conditions, a group of 70 Japanese women whose top priorities included women's enfranchisement. Swayed by the urges of female leaders, Home Minister Horiuchi Zenjiro advocated for granting women enfranchisement in a meeting of the Japanese male leaders of the Shidehara Cabinet on October 9, 1945. Convinced, the cabinet voted unanimously to grant women the right to vote. Two days later, before any action was taken to enact the cabinet's decision, General MacArthur issued his five-point reform directive, one of the points being an order to liberate Japanese women through enfranchisement. After MacArthur issued his directive, the Japanese government officially lowered the voting age and extended the voting franchise to women in future elections. On April 10, 1946, first post-war Japanese general election with 78.52% voter turnout among men and 66.97% among women was held, giving Japan its first prime minister partially elected by men and women, Shigeru Yoshida succeeded Kij\u016br\u014d Shidehara as prime minister, took office on May 22, 1946.\n\nHirohito renounces his divinity\nAt SCAP's insistence, as part of a New Year's Day message, Emperor Hirohito publicly renounced his own divinity, declaring:\n\nThe ties between Us and Our people have always stood upon mutual trust and affection. They do not depend upon mere legends and myths. They are not predicated on the false conception that the Emperor is divine, and that the Japanese people are superior to other races and fated to rule the world.\n\nConstitutional amendment\nIn 1947, the Diet ratified a new Constitution of Japan through amendment of Meiji Constitution that followed closely a \"model copy\" drafted by American civilian officials within SCAP, and was promulgated to replace the old Prussian-style Meiji Constitution that had granted the Emperor theoretically unlimited powers. The new constitution drew inspiration from the U.S. Bill of Rights, New Deal social legislation, the liberal constitutions of several European states and even the Soviet Union, and transferred sovereignty from the Emperor to the people in an attempt to depoliticize the Throne and reduce it to the status of a state symbol. Included in the revised charter was the famous Article Nine, whereby Japan forever renounced war as an instrument of state policy and became forbidden to maintain a standing army. The 1947 Constitution also officially enfranchised women, guaranteed fundamental human rights, strengthened the powers of Parliament and the Cabinet, and decentralized the police and local government.\n\nZaibatsu dissolution\nTo further remove Japan as a potential future threat to the United States, the Far Eastern Commission decided that Japan was to be partly de-industrialized.  In the end, SCAP adopted a program of de-industrialization and de-concentration in Japan that was implemented to a lesser degree than the similar U.S. \"industrial disarmament\" program in Germany. To this end, the prewar zaibatsu industrial conglomerates were pressured into undergoing \"voluntary\" dissolution into smaller independent companies. Although SCAP originally planned to break up 325 Japanese companies, as a result of changes in priorities in connection with the \"Reverse Course,\" in the end only the 11 largest companies were dissolved.\n\nLabor Standards Act\nThe Labor Standards Act was enacted on April 7, 1947, to govern working conditions in Japan. According to Article 1 of the Act, its goal was to ensure that \"Working conditions shall be those which should meet the needs of workers who live lives worthy of human beings.\" Support stemming from the Allied occupation has introduced better working conditions and pay for numerous employees in Japanese business. This allowed for more sanitary and hygienic working environments along with welfare and government assistance for health insurance, pensions plans and work involving other trained specialists. While it was created while Japan was under occupation, the origins of the Act have nothing to do with the occupation forces. It appears to have been the brainchild of Kosaku Teramoto, a former member of the Thought Police, who had become the head of the Labor Standards section of the Welfare Ministry.\n\nEducation reform\nBefore and during the war, Japanese education was based on the German system, with \"Gymnasien\" (selective grammar schools) and universities to train students after primary school. During the occupation, Japan's secondary education system was changed to incorporate three-year junior high schools and senior high schools similar to those in the United States: Junior high school became compulsory, but senior high school remained optional. The Imperial Rescript on Education was repealed, and the Imperial University system reorganized. The longstanding issue of Japanese script reform, which had been planned for decades but continuously opposed by more conservative elements, was also resolved during this time. The Japanese writing system was drastically reorganized with the T\u014dy\u014d kanji-list in 1946, predecessor of today's J\u014dy\u014d kanji, and orthography was greatly altered to reflect spoken usage.\n\nLand reform\nA sweeping land reform was also conducted, led by Wolf Ladejinsky from SCAP.  However, Ladejinsky would claim that the real architect of the reform was Hiroo Wada, former Japanese Minister of Agriculture and Forestry. Between 1947 and 1949, approximately 5,800,000 acres (23,000 km2) of land (approximately 38% of Japan's cultivated land) were purchased from the landlords under the government's reform program and resold at extremely low prices (after inflation) to the farmers who worked them. MacArthur's land reform redistribution resulted in only 10% of the land being worked by non-owners. By 1950, three million peasants had acquired land, dismantling a power structure that the landlords had long dominated.\n\nPunishing war criminals\nWhile these other reforms were taking place, various military tribunals, most notably the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in Ichigaya, were trying Japan's war criminals and sentencing many to death and imprisonment. However, many suspects such as Masanobu Tsuji, Nobusuke Kishi, Yoshio Kodama and Ry\u014dichi Sasakawa were never judged, while the Emperor Hirohito, all members of the imperial family implicated in the war such as Yasuhito, Prince Chichibu (younger brother of Hirohito), Prince Yasuhiko Asaka, Prince Fushimi Hiroyasu, former prime minister Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni (Princess Shigeko, Hirohito's eldest daughter's father-in-law) and Prince Tsuneyoshi Takeda, and all members of Unit 731\u2014including its director Dr. Shir\u014d Ishii\u2014were granted immunity from criminal prosecution by General MacArthur.\nBefore the war crimes trials actually convened, the SCAP, its International Prosecution Section (IPS) and Sh\u014dwa officials worked behind the scenes not only to prevent the imperial family from being indicted, but also to slant the testimony of the defendants to ensure that no one implicated the Emperor. High officials in court circles and the Sh\u014dwa government collaborated with Allied GHQ in compiling lists of prospective war criminals, while the individuals arrested as Class A suspects and incarcerated in Sugamo prison solemnly vowed to protect their sovereign against any possible taint of war responsibility. Thus, months before the Tokyo tribunal commenced, MacArthur's highest subordinates were working to attribute ultimate responsibility for attack on Pearl Harbor to former prime minister Hideki Tojo by allowing \"the major criminal suspects to coordinate their stories so that the Emperor would be spared from indictment.\" According to historian John W. Dower, \"With the full support of MacArthur's headquarters, the prosecution functioned, in effect, as a defense team for the emperor.\"\n\nIn Dower's view, Even Japanese peace activists who endorse the ideals of the Nuremberg and Tokyo charters, and who have labored to document and publicize Japanese atrocities, cannot defend the American decision to exonerate the emperor of war responsibility and then, in the chill of Cold War, release and soon afterwards openly embrace accused right-wing war criminals like the later prime minister Kishi Nobusuke.\n\nThe \"Reverse Course\"\nThe Reverse Course (\u9006\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9, gyaku k\u014dsu) is the name commonly given to a major shift in the Occupation policies that began in 1947 in response to the emerging global Cold War. In particular, U.S. priorities shifted from punishing and reforming Japan to ensuring internal political stability, rebuilding the shattered economy, and remilitarizing Japan to the extent possible under Article 9, in support of U.S. Cold War objectives in East Asia. This involved relaxing and in some cases even partially undoing earlier reforms the Occupation had enacted in 1945 and 1946. As a U.S. Department of State official history puts it, \"this 'Reverse Course'...focused on strengthening, not punishing, what would become a key Cold War ally.\"\nAn early sign of the shift in SCAP's thinking came in January 1947 when MacArthur announced that he would not permit a massive, nationwide general strike that labor unions had scheduled for February 1. Thereafter, the broader shift in Occupation policies became more and more apparent. Thousands of conservative and nationalist wartime leaders were de-purged and allowed to reenter politics and government ministries. In the industrial sector, plans for further anti-trust actions against the remains of the old zaibatsu industrial conglomerates were scrapped, and some earlier anti-trust policies were partially undone. The incomplete suppression of the zaibatsu allowed them to partially reform as \"informal associations\" known as keiretsu. SCAP also attempted to weaken the labor unions they had recently empowered, most notably issuing an edict stripping public-sector workers of their right to go on strike.\n\nIn order to stabilize the Japanese economy as soon as possible, American banker Joseph Dodge was brought in as an economic consultant. Dodge implemented the \"Dodge Line\" in 1949, a set of draconian contractionary fiscal and monetary policies that caused much hardship for the Japanese populace but succeeded in getting rampant inflation under control. Dodge also fixed the exchange rate at 360 yen to the dollar, a favorable rate that would help boost Japanese exports in the years to come and power the Japanese economic miracle.\nAs part of the Reverse Course, the United States also began pressuring Japan to remilitarize. In 1950, SCAP established the National Police Reserve (NPR), which would later become the basis of the present-day Japan Self Defense Forces (JSDF), founded in 1954.\nThe climax of the Reverse course came in the so-called \"Red Purge\" (reddo p\u0101ji) of 1950. The \"fall\" of China to the communists in 1949 and the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 had heightened conservative fears that communism was on the march in East Asia. Against this backdrop, the Japanese government and business leaders, with the connivance and encouragement of SCAP, purged tens of thousands of communists, alleged communists, and other leftists from government posts, private sector jobs, and teaching positions at schools and universities.\nThe Reverse Course significantly weakened left-wing forces and strengthened conservatives, laying the foundations for decades of conservative rule. At the same time, it did not completely destroy leftist forces that had been deliberately unleashed in the Occupation's early stages, setting the stage for extremely contentious political struggles and labor strife in the 1950s, culminating in the massive Anpo protests and Miike Coal Mine Strike, both in 1960.\n\nEnding the occupation\nIn 1949, MacArthur made a sweeping change in the SCAP power structure that greatly increased the power of Japan's native rulers, and the Occupation began to draw to a close. The Treaty of San Francisco, which was to end the occupation, was signed on September 8, 1951. It came into effect on April 28, 1952, formally ending all occupation powers of the Allied forces and restoring full sovereignty to Japan, except for the island chains of Iwo Jima and Okinawa, which the United States continued to hold. American occupation forces remained in Japan in a diminished capacity, until the dissolution of the Far East Command on July 1, 1957. Iwo Jima was returned to Japan in 1968, and most of Okinawa was returned in 1972.\nAs a condition of securing the end of the Occupation and the restoration of Japanese sovereignty, Japan was compelled by the United States to agree to the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, which has allowed US troops to remain based on Japanese soil on an indefinite basis. Even after the Occupation officially ended in 1952, a\ntotal of 260,000 American soldiers remained based on mainland Japan (exclusive of U.S.-controlled Okinawa, which based tens of thousands more). Even today, some 31,000 US military personnel remain based in Japan, including at major bases near Tokyo, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Aomori, Sapporo, and Ishikari.\nPopular anger at the continuing presence of these U.S. military bases in Japan even after the official end of the Occupation continued to grow over the course of the 1950s, leading to a nationwide anti-base movement and a number of spectacular protests, including Bloody May Day in 1952, the Sunagawa Struggle from 1955 to 1957, and the Girard Incident protests in 1957. Partially in response to these protests, the original 1951 Security Treaty was revised into a somewhat less one-sided pact in 1960, resulting in the current U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, which has had the effect of establishing a military alliance between the United States and Japan. However, even the revised treaty was opposed by many in Japan, leading to the massive 1960 Anpo protests, which were the largest protests in Japan's modern history.\nSince the end of the Occupation, the United States has continuously pressured Japan to revise its American-imposed constitution to remove Article 9 and fully remilitarize. As a result, in 1954 the National Police Reserve was reorganized into the Japan Self-Defense Forces, a de facto military force, with U.S. assistance. However, thus far Japan has resisted U.S. pressures to fully rearm and remilitarize. Under the Yoshida Doctrine, Japan continued to prioritize economic growth over defense spending, relying on American military protection to ensure it could focus mainly on economic recovery. Through \"guided capitalism,\" Japan was able to use its resources to economically recover from the war and revive industry, eventually sparking a lengthy period of unprecedented economic growth remembered as the Japanese economic miracle occurred from the 1960s to the Lost Decades of the 1990s.\n\nImpact\nProstitution\nWith the acceptance of the Allied occupation authorities, the Japanese organized a brothel system (the euphemistically named \"Recreation and Amusement Association,\" or RAA) for the benefit of the more than 300,000 occupation troops. Many Japanese civilians and government officials feared that the Allied occupation troops were likely to rape Japanese women. \"The strategy was, through the special work of experienced women, to create a breakwater to protect regular women and girls.\" A large contributor to this system being hastily implemented was the experience of the prior comfort women system.\nIn December 1945, a senior officer with the Public Health and Welfare Division of the occupation's General Headquarters wrote regarding the typical prostitute: \"The girl is impressed into contracting by the desperate financial straits of her parents and their urging, occasionally supplemented by her willingness to make such a sacrifice to help her family\", he wrote. \"It is the belief of our informants, however, that in urban districts the practice of enslaving girls, while much less prevalent than in the past, still exists. The worst victims ... were the women who, with no previous experience, answered the ads calling for 'Women of the New Japan.'\"\nMacArthur issued an order, SCAPIN 642 (SCAP Instruction), on January 21 ending licensed brothels for being \"in contravention of the ideals of democracy\". Although SCAPIN 642 ended the RAA's operations, it did not affect \"voluntary prostitution\" by individuals. Ultimately, SCAP responded by making all brothels and other facilities offering prostitution off-limits to Allied personnel on March 25, 1946. By November, the Japanese government had introduced the new akasen (\u8d64\u7dda, \"red-line\") system in which prostitution was permissible only in certain designated areas.\n\nRape\nAccording to Toshiyuki Tanaka, 76 cases of rape or rape-murder were reported during the first five years of the American occupation of Okinawa. However, he asserts this is probably not the true figure, as most cases were unreported. Some historians have estimated that U.S. troops committed thousands of rapes among the population of the Ryukyu Islands during the Okinawa Campaign and the beginning of the American occupation in 1945. One Okinawan historian estimated as many as 10,000 Okinawan women may have been raped in total.\nAs described above, Japanese authorities had set up a large system of prostitution facilities in order to protect the population from sexual assault. According to John W. Dower, precisely as the Japanese government had hoped when it created the prostitution facilities, while the RAA was in place \"the incidence of rape remained relatively low given the huge size of the occupation force.\" However, there was a resulting large rise in venereal disease among the soldiers, which led MacArthur to close down the prostitution in early 1946. The incidence of rape increased after the closure of the brothels, possibly eight-fold; Dower states that \"According to one calculation the number of rapes and assaults on Japanese women amounted to around 40 daily while the RAA was in operation, and then rose to an average of 330 a day after it was terminated in early 1946.\" Brian Walsh disputes Dower's numbers and states that rape was uncommon throughout the Occupation, with the number of daily rapes being much lower. According to Walsh, the increase in rapes during the termination of the RAA was brief in duration, and the numbers quickly declined thereafter.  Michael S. Molasky states that while rape and other violent crime were widespread in naval ports like Yokosuka and Yokohama during the first few weeks of occupation, according to Japanese police reports and journalistic studies, the number of incidents declined shortly after and they were not common on mainland Japan throughout the rest of occupation.\n\nCensorship\nAfter the surrender of Japan in 1945, SCAP abolished all forms of Japanese censorship and controls on freedom of speech, which would later be enshrined in Article 21 of the 1947 Constitution of Japan. However, two weeks into the Occupation, SCAP began censoring all media; on September 10, 1945, SCAP \"issued press and pre-censorship codes outlawing the publication of all reports and statistics 'inimical to the objectives of the Occupation'.\" This included any mention of rape or other sensitive social issues.\nAccording to David M. Rosenfeld:\n\n Not only did Occupation censorship forbid criticism of the United States or other Allied nations, but the mention of censorship itself was forbidden. This means, as Donald Keene observes, that for some producers of texts \"the Occupation censorship was even more exasperating than Japanese military censorship had been because it insisted that all traces of censorship be concealed. This meant that articles had to be rewritten in full, rather than merely submitting XXs for the offending phrases.\"\n\nJapanese women\nIt has been argued that the granting of rights to women played an important role in the radical shift Japan underwent from a war nation to a democratized and demilitarized country. In the first postwar general election of 1946, for which Japanese women had suffrage for the first time, over a third of the votes were cast by women. This unexpectedly high female voter turnout led to the election of 39 female candidates, and the increasing presence of women in politics was perceived by Americans as evidence of an improvement of Japanese women's condition.\nAmerican feminists saw Japanese women as victims of feudalistic and chauvinistic traditions that had to be broken by the Occupation. American women assumed a central role in the reforms that affected the lives of Japanese women: they educated Japanese about Western ideals of democracy, and it was an American woman, Beate Sirota, who wrote the articles guaranteeing equality between men and women for the new constitution. General Douglas MacArthur did not mean for Japanese women to give up their central role in the home as wives and mothers, but rather that they could now assume other roles simultaneously, such as that of worker.\nIn 1953, journalist Ichir\u014d Narumigi commented that Japan had received \"liberation of sex\" along with the \"four presents\" that it had been granted by the occupation (respect for human rights, gender equality, freedom of speech, and women's enfranchisement). Indeed, the occupation also had a great impact on relationships between men and women in Japan. The \"modern girl\" phenomenon of the 1920s and early 1930s had been characterized by greater sexual freedom, but, despite this, sex was usually not perceived as a source of pleasure (for women) in Japan. Westerners, as a result, were thought to be promiscuous and sexually deviant. The sexual liberation of European and North American women during World War II was unthinkable in Japan, especially during wartime where rejection of Western ways of life was encouraged.\nThe Japanese public was thus astounded by the sight of some 45,000 so-called \"pan pan girls\" (prostitutes) fraternizing with American soldiers during the occupation. In 1946, the 200 wives of U.S. officers landing in Japan to visit their husbands also had a similar impact when many of these reunited couples were seen walking hand-in-hand and kissing in public. Both prostitution and marks of affection had been hidden from the public until then, and this \"democratization of eroticism\" was a source of surprise, curiosity, and even envy. The occupation set new models for relationships between Japanese men and women: The Western practice of \"dating\" spread, and activities such as dancing, movies and coffee were not limited to \"pan pan girls\" and American troops anymore, and became popular among young Japanese couples.\n\nPolitics\nUnlike Allied-occupied Germany, the government of Japan continued to exist during the occupation. Although MacArthur's official staff history of the occupation referred to \"the Eighth Army Military Government System\", it explained that while \"In Germany, with the collapse of the Nazi regime, all government agencies disintegrated, or had to be purged\", the Japanese retained an \"integrated, responsible government and it continued to function almost intact\":\n\nIn effect, there was no \"military government\" in Japan in the literal sense of the word. It was simply a SCAP superstructure over already existing government machinery, designed to observe and assist the Japanese along the new democratic channels of administration.\nGeneral Horace Robertson of Australia, head of BCOF, wrote:\n\nMacArthur at no time established in Japan what could be correctly described as Military government. He continued to use the Japanese government to control the country, but teams of military personnel, afterward replaced to quite a considerable extent by civilians, were placed throughout the Japanese prefectures as a check on the extent to which the prefectures were carrying out the directives issued by MacArthur\u2019s headquarters or the orders from the central government.\nThe really important duty of the so called Military government teams was, however, the supervision of the issue throughout Japan of the large quantities of food stuffs and medical stores being poured into the country from American sources. The teams also contained so-called experts on health, education, sanitation, agriculture and the like, to help the Japanese in adopting more up to date methods sponsored by SCAP\u2019s headquarters. The normal duties of a military government organisation, the most important of which are law and order and a legal system, were never needed in Japan since the Japanese government\u2019s normal legal system still functioned with regard to all Japanese nationals ... The so-called military government in Japan was therefore neither military nor government.\nThe Japanese government's de facto authority was strictly limited at first, however, and senior figures in the government such as the Prime Minister effectively served at the pleasure of the occupation authorities before the first post-war elections were held. Political parties had begun to revive almost immediately after the occupation began. Left-wing organizations, such as the Japan Socialist Party and the Japan Communist Party, quickly reestablished themselves, as did various conservative parties. The old Seiyukai and Rikken Minseito came back as, respectively, the Liberal Party (Nihon Jiyuto) and the Japan Progressive Party (Nihon Shimpoto). The first postwar elections were held in 1946 (women were given the franchise for the first time), and the Liberal Party's vice president, Shigeru Yoshida (1878\u20131967), became prime minister. For the 1947 elections, anti-Yoshida forces left the Liberal Party and joined forces with the Progressive Party to establish the new Japan Democratic Party (Minshuto). This divisiveness in conservative ranks gave a plurality to the Japan Socialist Party, which was allowed to form a cabinet, which lasted less than a year. Thereafter, the socialist party steadily declined in its electoral successes. After a short period of Democratic Party administration, Yoshida returned in late 1948 and continued to serve as prime minister until 1954.\n\nJapanese American contribution\nJapan accepted the terms of the Potsdam Declaration on August 15, and officially surrendered on September 2, 1945. Over 5,000 Japanese Americans served in the occupation of Japan. Dozens of Japanese Americans served as translators, interpreters, and investigators in the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. Thomas Sakamoto served as press escort during the occupation of Japan. He escorted American correspondents to Hiroshima, and the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay. Sakamoto was one of three Japanese Americans to be on board the USS Missouri when the Japanese formally surrendered. Arthur S. Komori served as personal interpreter for Brig. Gen. Elliot R. Thorpe. Kay Kitagawa served as personal interpreter of Fleet Admiral William Halsey Jr. Kan Tagami served as personal interpreter-aide for General Douglas MacArthur. Journalist Don Caswell was accompanied by a Japanese American interpreter to Fuch\u016b Prison, where the Japanese government imprisoned communists Tokuda Kyuichi, Yoshio Shiga, and Shiro Mitamura.\n\nCriticism\nOn the day the occupation of Japan was over, the Asahi Shimbun published a very critical essay on the occupation, calling it \"almost akin to colonialism\" and claiming it turned the Japanese population \"irresponsible, obsequious and listless... unable to perceive issues in a forthright manner, which led to distorted perspectives\".\n\nSee also\nBeate Sirota Gordon\nValery Burati\nCold War\n1945 in Japan\nPostwar Japan\nJapanese economic miracle\nSecurity Treaty Between the United States and Japan\n1971 Okinawa Reversion Agreement\nShipping Control Authority for the Japanese Merchant Marine\n\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\nWorks cited\nBooks\nAsahi Shimbun Staff, The Pacific Rivals: A Japanese View of Japanese-American Relations, New York: Weatherhill, 1972.

The United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health maintains the database as part of the Entrez system of information retrieval.\nFrom 1971 to 1997, online access to the MEDLINE database had been primarily through institutional facilities, such as university libraries. PubMed, first released in January 1996, ushered in the era of private, free, home- and office-based MEDLINE searching. The PubMed system was offered free to the public starting in June 1997.\n\nContent\nIn addition to MEDLINE, PubMed provides access to:\n\nolder references from the print version of Index Medicus, back to 1951 and earlier\nreferences to some journals before they were indexed in Index Medicus and MEDLINE, for instance Science, BMJ, and Annals of Surgery\nvery recent entries to records for an article before it is indexed with Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and added to MEDLINE\na collection of books available full-text and other subsets of NLM records\nPMC citations\nNCBI Bookshelf\nMany PubMed records contain links to full text articles, some of which are freely available, often in PubMed Central and local mirrors, such as Europe PubMed Central.\nInformation about the journals indexed in MEDLINE, and available through PubMed, is found in the NLM Catalog.\nAs of 23 May 2023, PubMed has more than 35 million citations and abstracts dating back to 1966, selectively to the year 1865, and very selectively to 1809. As of the same date, 24.6 million of PubMed's records are listed with their abstracts, and 26.8 million records have links to full-text versions (of which 10.9 million articles are available, full-text for free). Over the last 10 years (ending 31 December 2019), an average of nearly one million new records were added each year. \nIn 2016, NLM changed the indexing system so that publishers are able to directly correct typos and errors in PubMed indexed articles.\nPubMed has been reported to include some articles published in predatory journals. MEDLINE and PubMed policies for the selection of journals for database inclusion are slightly different. Weaknesses in the criteria and procedures for indexing journals in PubMed Central may allow publications from predatory journals to leak into PubMed.\n\nCharacteristics\nWebsite design\nA new PubMed interface was launched in October 2009 and encouraged the use of such quick, Google-like search formulations; they have also been described as 'telegram' searches. By default the results are sorted by Most Recent, but this can be changed to Best Match, Publication Date, First Author, Last Author, Journal, or Title.\nThe PubMed website design and domain was updated in January 2020 and became default on 15 May 2020, with the updated and new features. There was a critical reaction from many researchers who frequently use the site.\n\nPubMed for handhelds\/mobiles\nPubMed\/MEDLINE can be accessed via handheld devices, using for instance the \"PICO\" option (for focused clinical questions) created by the NLM. A \"PubMed Mobile\" option, providing access to a mobile friendly, simplified PubMed version, is also available.\n\nSearch\nStandard search\nSimple searches on PubMed can be carried out by entering key aspects of a subject into PubMed's search window.\nPubMed translates this initial search formulation and automatically adds field names, relevant MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms, synonyms, Boolean operators, and 'nests' the resulting terms appropriately, enhancing the search formulation significantly, in particular by routinely combining (using the OR operator) textwords and MeSH terms.\nThe examples given in a PubMed tutorial demonstrate how this automatic process works:\n\nCauses Sleep Walking is translated as (\"etiology\"[Subheading] OR \"etiology\"[All Fields] OR \"causes\"[All Fields] OR \"causality\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"causality\"[All Fields]) AND (\"somnambulism\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"somnambulism\"[All Fields] OR (\"sleep\"[All Fields] AND \"walking\"[All Fields]) OR \"sleep walking\"[All Fields])\nLikewise,\n\nsoft\n Attack Aspirin Prevention is translated as (\"myocardial infarction\"[MeSH Terms] OR (\"myocardial\"[All Fields] AND \"infarction\"[All Fields]) OR \"myocardial infarction\"[All Fields] OR (\"heart\"[All Fields] AND \"attack\"[All Fields]) OR \"heart attack\"[All Fields]) AND (\"aspirin\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"aspirin\"[All Fields]) AND (\"prevention and control\"[Subheading] OR (\"prevention\"[All Fields] AND \"control\"[All Fields]) OR \"prevention and control\"[All Fields] OR \"prevention\"[All Fields])\n\nComprehensive search\nFor optimal searches in PubMed, it is necessary to understand its core component, MEDLINE, and especially of the MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) controlled vocabulary used to index MEDLINE articles. They may also require complex search strategies, use of field names (tags), proper use of limits and other features; reference librarians and search specialists offer search services.\nThe search into PubMed's search window is only recommended for the search of unequivocal topics or new interventions that do not yet have a MeSH heading created, as well as for the search for commercial brands of medicines and proper nouns. It is also useful when there is no suitable heading or the descriptor represents a partial aspect. The search using the thesaurus MeSH is more accurate and will give fewer irrelevant results. In addition, it saves the disadvantage of the free text search in which the spelling, singular\/plural or abbreviated differences have to be taken into consideration. On the other side, articles more recently incorporated into the database to which descriptors have not yet been assigned will not be found. Therefore, to guarantee an exhaustive search, a combination of controlled language headings and free text terms must be used.\n\nJournal article parameters\nWhen a journal article is indexed, numerous article parameters are extracted and stored as structured information. Such parameters are: Article Type (MeSH terms, e.g., \"Clinical Trial\"), Secondary identifiers, (MeSH terms), Language, Country of the Journal or publication history (e-publication date, print journal publication date).\n\nPublication Type: Clinical queries\/systematic reviews\nPublication type parameter allows searching by the type of publication, including reports of various kinds of clinical research.\n\nSecondary ID\nSince July 2005, the MEDLINE article indexing process extracts identifiers from the article abstract and puts those in a field called Secondary Identifier (SI). The secondary identifier field is to store accession numbers to various databases of molecular sequence data, gene expression or chemical compounds and clinical trial IDs. For clinical trials, PubMed extracts trial IDs for the two largest trial registries: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT identifier) and the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Register (IRCTN identifier).\n\nSee also\nA reference which is judged particularly relevant can be marked and \"related articles\" can be identified. If relevant, several studies can be selected and related articles to all of them can be generated (on PubMed or any of the other NCBI Entrez databases) using the 'Find related data' option. The related articles are then listed in order of \"relatedness\". To create these lists of related articles, PubMed compares words from the title and abstract of each citation, as well as the MeSH headings assigned, using a powerful word-weighted algorithm. The 'related articles' function has been judged to be so precise that the authors of a paper suggested it can be used instead of a full search.\n\nMapping to MeSH\nPubMed automatically links to MeSH terms and subheadings. Examples would be: \"bad breath\" links to (and includes in the search) \"halitosis\", \"heart attack\" to \"myocardial infarction\", \"breast cancer\" to \"breast neoplasms\". Where appropriate, these MeSH terms are automatically \"expanded\", that is, include more specific terms. Terms like \"nursing\" are automatically linked to \"Nursing [MeSH]\" or \"Nursing [Subheading]\". This feature is called Auto Term Mapping and is enacted, by default, in free text searching but not exact phrase searching (i.e. enclosing the search query with double quotes). This feature makes PubMed searches more sensitive and avoids false-negative (missed) hits by compensating for the diversity of medical terminology.\nPubMed does not apply automatic mapping of the term in the following circumstances: by writing the quoted phrase (e.g., \"kidney allograft\"), when truncated on the asterisk (e.g., kidney allograft*), and when looking with field labels (e.g., Cancer [ti]).\n\nMy NCBI\nThe PubMed optional facility \"My NCBI\" (with free registration) provides tools for\n\nsaving searches\nfiltering search results\nsetting up automatic updates sent by e-mail\nsaving sets of references retrieved as part of a PubMed search\nconfiguring display formats or highlighting search terms\nand a wide range of other options. The \"My NCBI\" area can be accessed from any computer with web-access.\nAn earlier version of \"My NCBI\" was called \"PubMed Cubby\".\n\nLinkOut\nLinkOut is an NLM facility to link and make available full-text local journal holdings. Some 3,200 sites (mainly academic institutions) participate in this NLM facility (as of March 2010), from Aalborg University in Denmark to ZymoGenetics in Seattle. Users at these institutions see their institution's logo within the PubMed search result (if the journal is held at that institution) and can access the full-text. Link out is being consolidated with Outside Tool as of the major platform update coming in the Summer of 2019.\n\nPubMed Commons\nIn 2016, PubMed allows authors of articles to comment on articles indexed by PubMed. This feature was initially tested in a pilot mode (since 2013) and was made permanent in 2016. In February 2018, PubMed Commons was discontinued due to the fact that \"usage has remained minimal\".\n\naskMEDLINE\naskMEDLINE, a free-text, natural language query tool for MEDLINE\/PubMed, developed by the NLM, also suitable for handhelds.\n\nPubMed identifier\nA PMID (PubMed identifier or PubMed unique identifier) is a unique integer value, starting at 1, assigned to each PubMed record. A PMID is not the same as a PMCID (PubMed Central identifier) which is the identifier for all works published in the free-to-access PubMed Central.\nThe assignment of a PMID or PMCID to a publication tells the reader nothing about the type or quality of the content. PMIDs are assigned to letters to the editor, editorial opinions, op-ed columns, and any other piece that the editor chooses to include in the journal, as well as peer-reviewed papers. The existence of the identification number is also not proof that the papers have not been retracted for fraud, incompetence, or misconduct. The announcement about any corrections to original papers may be assigned a PMID.\nEach number that is entered in the PubMed search window is treated by default as if it were a PMID. Therefore, any reference in PubMed can be located using the PMID.\n\nAlternative interfaces\nThe National Library of Medicine leases the MEDLINE information to a number of private vendors such as Embase, Ovid, Dialog, EBSCO, Knowledge Finder and many other commercial, non-commercial, and academic providers. As of October 2008, more than 500 licenses had been issued, more than 200 of them to providers outside the United States. As licenses to use MEDLINE data are available for free, the NLM in effect provides a free testing ground for a wide range of alternative interfaces and 3rd party additions to PubMed, one of a very few large, professionally curated databases which offers this option.\nLu identifies a sample of 28 current and free Web-based PubMed versions, requiring no installation or registration, which are grouped into four categories:\n\nRanking search results, for instance: eTBLAST; MedlineRanker; MiSearch;\nClustering results by topics, authors, journals etc., for instance: Anne O'Tate; ClusterMed;\nEnhancing semantics and visualization, for instance: EBIMed; MedEvi.\nImproved search interface and retrieval experience, for instance, askMEDLINE BabelMeSH; and PubCrawler.\nAs most of these and other alternatives rely essentially on PubMed\/MEDLINE data leased under license from the NLM\/PubMed, the term \"PubMed derivatives\" has been suggested. Without the need to store about 90 GB of original PubMed Datasets, anybody can write PubMed applications using the eutils-application program interface as described in \"The E-utilities In-Depth: Parameters, Syntax and More\", by Eric Sayers, PhD. Various citation format generators, taking PMID numbers as input, are examples of web applications making use of the eutils-application program interface. Sample web pages include Citation Generator \u2013 Mick Schroeder, Pubmed Citation Generator \u2013 Ultrasound of the Week, PMID2cite, and Cite this for me.\n\nData mining of PubMed\nAlternative methods to mine the data in PubMed use programming environments such as Matlab, Python or R. In these cases, queries of PubMed are written as lines of code and passed to PubMed and the response is then processed directly in the programming environment.  Code can be automated to systematically query with different keywords such as disease, year, organs, etc. \nIn addition to its traditional role as a biomedical database, PubMed has become common resource for training biomedical language models. Recent advancements in this field include the development of models like PubMedGPT, a 2.7B parameter model trained on PubMed data by Stanford CRFM, and Microsoft's BiomedCLIP-PubMedBERT, which utilizes figure-caption pairs from PubMed Central for vision-language processing. These models demonstrate the significant potential of PubMed data in enhancing the capabilities of AI in medical research and healthcare applications. Such advancements underline the growing intersection between large-scale data mining and AI development in the biomedical field.\nThe data accessible by PubMed can be mirrored locally using an unofficial tool such as MEDOC.\nMillions of PubMed records augment various open data datasets about open access, like Unpaywall. Data analysis tools like Unpaywall Journals are used by libraries to assist with big deal cancellations: libraries can avoid subscriptions for materials already served by instant open access via open archives like PubMed Central.\n\nSee also\nEurope PubMed Central\nJournalReview.org\nList of academic databases and search engines\nPubMed Central\nPubMed Central Canada\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nPubMed search tags & field qualifiers","144":"Siddharth Pico Raghavan Iyer (born 11 February 1957), known as Pico Iyer, is a British-born essayist and novelist known chiefly for his [writing on explorations both inner and outer ]. He is the author of numerous books on crossing cultures including Video Night in Kathmandu, The Lady and the Monk and The Global Soul. He has been a constant  contributor to Time, Harper's, The New York Review of Books, and The New York Times, among a huge selection of other periodicals\n\nEarly life\nIyer was born Siddharth Pico Raghavan Iyer in Oxford, England, the son of Indian parents.  His father was Raghavan N. Iyer, a philosopher and political theorist then enrolled in doctoral studies at the University of Oxford. His mother was the religious scholar and teacher Nandini Nanak Mehta. He is the great-great-grandson of Indian Gujarati writer Mahipatram Nilkanth. Both of his parents grew up in India then went to England for tertiary education at Oxford, his father as India\u2019s lone Rhodes Scholar in 1950. His name is a combination of the Buddha's name, Siddhartha and that of the Italian Renaissance philosopher Pico della Mirandola, author of On The Dignity of Man.\nWhen Iyer was seven, in 1964, his family moved to California, when his father started working with the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions, a California-based think tank, and started teaching at University of California, Santa Barbara. For over a decade, Iyer moved between schools and college in England and his parents' home in California.\nHe was a King's Scholar at Eton College, and won a Demyship  Magdalen College, Oxford]] and was awarded a congratulatory double first in English literature in 1978, with the highest marks of any student of English Literature. He then received an A.M. in literature from Harvard University in 1980, to go with the [Oxford MA] he was awarded in 1982.\nIn 2017 he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Humane Letters by Chapman University, and in 2024 granted the same honor by Lewis & Clark College.\n\nCareer\nIyer taught writing and literature at Harvard before joining Time in 1982 as a writer on world affairs. Since then, he has travelled widely, from North Korea to Easter Island, and from Paraguay to Ethiopia, while writing works of non-fiction and two novels, including Video Night in Kathmandu (1988), The Lady and the Monk (1991), The Global Soul (2000) and The Man Within My Head (2012). He is also a frequent speaker at literary festivals and universities around the world. He delivered popular TED talks in 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2019 [see ted.com] and has twice been a Fellow at the World Economic Forum in Davos.\nIn 2019, he served as Ferris Professor of Journalism at Princeton University, Guest Director of the Telluride Film Festival. He was also the first writer-in-residence at Raffles Hotel Singapore, where he released his book, This Could be Home (2019), which explores Singapore's heritage through its landmarks.\nHis 2023 book, The Half Known Life, was a national best-seller, like his earlier works The Open Road  and The Art of Stillness. It was also named one of the best books of the year by The New York Times, The New Yorker, Time, NPR and many other news-sources. In addition, it won a Lowell Thomas Gold Medal as Best Travel Book of the Year.\n\nWriting themes\nIyer\u2019s writings began by observing the accelerating criss-crossing of cultures in Asia and across the world, and then, in his 2000 book, The Global Soul, he took that examination within, to explore the quickly increasing number of people world-wide who have many homes and a far wider, and sometimes less visible, sense of belonging than in times past. In a sequel to The Global Soul, The Open Road, he wrote about the XIVth Dalai Lama as an arresting example of one who had found home everywhere in a constantly moving world and reminded all of us that where you stand is more important than where you live.\nHis subsequent books have been more and more about the inner landscape\u2014how to find faith in a world that often mocks it\u2014and, as he writes in The Half Known Life, how to blend the realism we all need with the hope we can\u2019t live without. Writing often on Leonard Cohen, Thomas Merton, Emily Dickinson and Graham Greene, he has moved beyond the surface, external descriptions of our shifting global world to a deeper enquiry into how we can live.\nHe has written numerous pieces on world affairs for Time, including cover stories, and the \"Woman of the Year\" story on Corazon Aquino in 1986. He has written on literature for The New York Review of Books; on globalism for Harper's; on travel for the Financial Times; and on many other themes for The New York Times, National Geographic, The Times Literary Supplement, contributing up to a hundred articles a year to various publications. He has contributed liner-notes for four Leonard Cohen albums. His books have appeared in 23 languages so far, including Turkish, Russian, and Indonesian. He has also written introductions to more than 70 books, including works by R. K. Narayan, Somerset Maugham, Graham Greene, Michael Ondaatje, Peter Matthiessen, and Isamu Noguchi.\nHe has appeared seven times in the annual Best Spiritual Writing anthology, and three times in the annual Best American Travel Writing anthology, and has served as guest editor for both. He has also appeared in the Best American Essays anthology.\nThe Utne Reader named him in 1995 as one of 100 Visionaries worldwide who could change your life, while the New Yorker observed that \"As a guide to far-flung places, Pico Iyer can hardly be surpassed.\"\n\nPersonal life\nIyer has been based since 1992 in Nara, Japan, where he lives with his Japanese wife, Hiroko Takeuchi, and her two children from an earlier marriage. His book, The Lady and the Monk (1991), was a memoir and a reflection of his first year staying in Japan and his first meetings, in 1987, with Takeuchi. His family home in Santa Barbara, California burned down due to a wildfire in 1990. Reflecting on this event, in his words, \"For more and more of us, home has really less to do with a piece of soil, than you could say, with a piece of soul.\" He splits his time between Japan and California. Asked if he feels rooted and accepted as a foreigner (regarding his current life in Japan) Iyer notes:\"Japan is therefore an ideal place because I never will be a true citizen here, and will always be an outsider, however long I live here and however well I speak the language. And the society around me is as comfortable with that as I am... I am not rooted in a place, I think, so much as in certain values and affiliations and friendships that I carry everywhere I go; my home is both invisible and portable. But I would gladly stay in this physical location for the rest of my life, and there is nothing in life that I want that it doesn't have.\"\n\nIyer has known the 14th Dalai Lama since he was in his late teens, when he accompanied his father to Dharamshala, India, in 1974. In discussions about his spirituality, Iyer has mentioned not having a formal meditation practice, but practicing regular solitude, visiting a remote hermitage near Big Sur one hundred times since 1991\n\nBibliography\nBooks\nIyer, Pico (1984).

On leaving the theater, they happen to chance on a girl, Harue (Nobuko Fushimi), who is destitute with no place to go. Jiro is reluctant to help her out but Kihachi takes a fancy on the pretty girl and decides to give her a place to stay at the house of a restaurant owner friend, Otome (Chouko Iida).  She helps out at the place and Otome soon takes a liking for her.\nKihachi, an illiterate widower, becomes enamored of the girl and begins grooming himself so that she will take notice of him.  Jiro, who is younger and in his thirties, thinks of Harue as nothing but trouble and treats her rudely.  Kihachi has a young son Tomio (Tokkan Kozo) who is a fine student at an elementary school.  Harue confides in Kihachi that she thinks him nothing more than a kind uncle.  Meanwhile, Otome goes to Kihachi and asks him to talk Jiro into marrying Harue.  Kihachi is upset that no one thinks Harue a suitable match for himself, but he speaks to Jiro nonetheless, but Jiro gruffly rejects Kihachi.\nKihachi gives Tomio 50 sen to treat himself, and he ends up stuffing himself with so much sweets that he becomes sick with acute enteritis.  Kihachi and Otome fear for his life while his teacher and a classmate visit him to urge him to get well.\nKihachi cannot afford the doctor's bill.  Harue offers to raise the money but is stopped privately by Jiro, who instead goes to his barber friend for a loan.  To repay the loan, Jiro decides to go to Hokkaido to work as a laborer.  He promises Harue to return.  Just at this point, Kihachi appears and to stop Jiro from going, knocks him unconscious so that he will miss his ship which departs later that day.  Kihachi decides to work in Hokkaido instead, despite the attempted dissuasions of Otome and the barber.

It was Shind\u014d's last film before his death in 2012 at age 100. The film is set during and after the Pacific War and deals with the effect of the death of soldiers on their families. It is loosely based on Shind\u014d's wartime experiences.\n\nPlot\nNear the end of the Pacific War, Sadazo Morikawa is one of a group of 100 overaged conscripts for the Japanese navy assigned to cleaning duty. Once the cleaning duty has finished, the members are chosen by lottery for various duties. Sadazo is assigned to serve in the Philippines. He thinks he will not survive, and asks a comrade, Matsuyama, to return a postcard to his wife, Tomoko, and tell her that he received it before he died.\nEarlier, Sadazo is conscripted, and he says goodbye to his parents Yukichi and Chiyo and wife Tomoko. Later, a military official reports Sadazo's death. Sadazo's parents plead with Tomoko not to leave, and to marry their younger son Sanpei. Tomoko agrees to marry Sanpei. Sanpei is conscripted. He considers running away but his parents tell him it is useless. Sanpei dies in the war. Later, during farm work, Yukichi dies from a heart condition. Chiyo gives Tomoko some money and then hangs herself.\nThe war ends and Matsuyama returns to Japan. His wife has run away after an affair with his father, and is now working as a bar hostess in Osaka. They meet and argue, and she tells him she wishes he had died in the war. Matsuyama makes his way to Tomoko's house to deliver the postcard. He talks about Sadazo and tells her he plans to go to Brazil. He has 200,000 yen from the sale of his fishing boat, and he tries to give her half. She refuses. He has a fight with Kichigoro, another suitor of Tomoko. After Tomoko and Matsuyama quarrel, they agree to go to Brazil together. They burn Sadazo and Sanpei's ashes. Tomoko gets drunk and sets fire to the house.

The film stars the voices of Y\u014dji Matsuda, Yuriko Ishida, Y\u016bko Tanaka, Kaoru Kobayashi, Masahiko Nishimura, Tsunehiko Kamijo, Akihiro Miwa, Mitsuko Mori, and Hisaya Morishige. \nSet in the late Muromachi period of Japan (approximately 1336 to 1573 AD) and including fantasy elements, the story follows a young Emishi prince named Ashitaka, and his involvement in a struggle between the gods (kami) and spirits (y\u014dkai) of a forest against the humans who consume its resources. The film deals with a recurrent theme in Studio Ghibli work environmentalism as a reaction against over-industrialization within the context of Shintoism, animism, and folklore.\nPrincess Mononoke was released in Japan on July 12, 1997, by Toho, and in the United States on October 29, 1999. A critical and commercial success, the film became the highest-grossing film in Japan of 1997, and also held Japan's box office record for domestic films until 2001's Spirited Away, another Miyazaki film. It was dubbed into English with a script by Neil Gaiman and initially distributed in North America by Miramax, where it sold well on home media despite not performing strongly at the box office. The film greatly increased Ghibli's popularity and influence outside Japan.\n\nPlot\nIn Muromachi Japan, an Emishi village is attacked by a hideous demon. The last Emishi prince, Ashitaka, kills it before it reaches the village, but it grasps his arm and curses him before its death. The curse grants him superhuman strength, but it also causes him pain and it will eventually kill him. The villagers discover that the demon was a boar god, corrupted by an iron ball lodged in his body. The village's wise woman, H\u012b-sama, tells Ashitaka that he may find a cure in the western lands that the demon came from, and that he cannot return to his homeland.\nHeading west, Ashitaka meets Jigo, an opportunistic monk who tells Ashitaka he may find help from the Great Forest Spirit, a  deer-like animal god by day and a giant Nightwalker by night. Nearby, men on a cliffside herd oxen to their home of Iron Town, led by Lady Eboshi, and repel an attack by a wolf pack led by the wolf goddess Moro, whom Eboshi wounds with a gun shot. Riding one of the wolves is San, a human girl. Down below, Ashitaka encounters San and the wolves, who rebuff his greeting. He then rescues two of the men fallen from the cliff and transports them back through the forest, where he briefly glimpses the Great Forest Spirit.\nAshitaka and the survivors arrive at Iron Town, where he is greeted with fascination. Iron Town is a refuge for outcasts and lepers employed to process iron and create firearms, such as hand cannons and matchlock muskets. Ashitaka learns that the town was built by clearcutting forests to mine the iron, leading to conflicts with Asano, a daimy\u014d (kanrei), and a giant boar god named Nago. Eboshi admits that she shot Nago, incidentally turning him into the demon that attacked Ashitaka's village. She also reveals that San \u2014 dubbed Princess Mononoke, a supernatural spirit of retribution \u2014 was raised by the wolves and hates humankind.\nSan infiltrates Iron Town and fights Eboshi, but Ashitaka intervenes and subdues them both. Amidst the hysteria, a villager with a firearm shoots him, but the curse gives him strength to carry San out of the village. San wakes and tries killing the weakened Ashitaka, but hesitates when he compliments her beauty. She decides to trust him after the Forest Spirit heals his bullet wound that night. The next day, a boar clan led by the blind god Okkoto plans to attack Iron Town to save the forest. Eboshi sets out to kill the Forest Spirit with Jigo. Eboshi intends to give the god's head to the Emperor (who believes it will grant him immortality) in return for protection from Asano, while Jigo desires the large reward being offered.\nAshitaka recovers and finds Iron Town besieged by Asano's samurai and jizamurai. The boar clan has been annihilated in battle, and Okkoto is badly wounded. Jigo's men trick Okkoto into leading them to the Forest Spirit. San tries stopping Okkoto but is swept up as his pain corrupts him into a demon. As everyone clashes at the pool of the Forest Spirit, Ashitaka rescues San while the Forest Spirit euthanizes Moro and Okkoto. As it begins to transform into the Nightwalker Eboshi decapitates it. Jigo steals the head, while the Forest Spirit's body bleeds ooze that spreads over the land and kills anything it touches. The forest and its spirits begin to die. Moro's head briefly comes alive and bites off Eboshi's right arm, but she survives. An enraged San tries killing Eboshi, but is stopped by Ashitaka, who consoles her and encourages her not to give up.\nAfter Iron Town is evacuated, Ashitaka and San pursue Jigo and retrieve the head, returning it to the Forest Spirit. The Spirit dies but its form washes over the land, healing it and lifting Ashitaka's curse. Ashitaka stays to help rebuild Iron Town, but promises San he will visit her in the forest. Eboshi vows to build a better town and the forest begins to regrow.\n\nVoice cast\nProduction\nDevelopment\nMiyazaki composed the preliminary ideas for what would become Princess Mononoke shortly after the release of his first film The Castle of Cagliostro (1979), drawing sketches of a princess living in the woods with a beast. After unsuccessfully proposing the project to several production companies, Miyazaki published his concepts in a 1983 book, republished in 2014 as Princess Mononoke: The First Story. While being set in Japan, the concept had strong similarities to the fairy tale \"Beauty and the Beast\" (1740). According to film scholar Rayna Denison, the differences that can be discerned between the original idea and the final film demonstrate the radical change of Miyazaki's filmmaking philosophies. Upon the completion of his manga series Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (1994), Miyazaki began work on the project proposal for the film in April 1994. However, encountering writer's block in December of that year, he decided to take a break from the production and direct the short film On Your Mark (1995) as a side project. Miyazaki returned to the film and began working on the storyboards in April 1995.\nTo achieve the environmental depiction that he was seeking to portray, Miyazaki and four art directors visited the island of Yakushima in May 1995. Additionally, art director Kazuo Oga went to the Shirakami-Sanchi mountains, which had already inspired some environments in Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind.\nMiyazaki did not want to create an accurate history of Medieval Japan, and wanted to \"portray the very beginnings of the seemingly insoluble conflict between the natural world and modern industrial civilization.\" Despite being set during the Muromachi period, the actual time period of Princess Mononoke depicts a \"symbolic neverwhen clash of three proto-Japanese races (the Jomon, Yamato and Emishi).\"\nTwo titles were originally considered for the film. One, ultimately chosen, has been translated into English as Princess Mononoke. The other title can be translated into English as The Legend of Ashitaka (\u30a2\u30b7\u30bf\u30ab\ud85b\uded9\u8a18, Ashitaka Sekki), and it contains an uncommon kanji \ud85b\uded9 that represents \"a legend passed down from ear to ear without being recorded in official history\", according to Miyazaki. In a Tokyo Broadcasting System program, televised on November 26, 2013, Toshio Suzuki mentioned that Miyazaki had preferred The Legend of Ashitaka as the title while Suzuki himself favored Princess Mononoke, though the former title was eventually reused for the first song on the soundtrack.\n\nAnimation\nPrincess Mononoke was produced with a budget of \u00a52.35 billion (US$19.6 million; US$36.6 million in 2023), making it the most expensive Japanese animation at the time. The film used 144,000 cels, 80,000 of them being key animation frames, more than any other Studio Ghibli film. Miyazaki is estimated to have drawn or retouched nearly 80,000 cels himself. The animation production commenced in July 1995. The final storyboards were finished in June 1997.\n\nComputer graphics\nThe decision to use computer graphics was made early in the production at Miyazaki's request, starting with the opening sequence of the demon god. A variety of techniques were eventually used in the animation process: digital ink and paint, used to color the frames; 3D rendering and digital compositing, which put the hand-drawn images in a three-dimensional environment to create more visual depth; and morphing and particle effects, which create additional detail and smoother transitions. Approximately five minutes of the film were animated entirely using digital processes. A further ten minutes use digital ink and paint, a technique used in all subsequent Studio Ghibli films.\n\nThemes\nEnvironmentalism is a central theme of Princess Mononoke. Film scholars Colin Odell and Michelle Le Blanc wrote that the film simultaneously mounts a criticism of humanity's mistreatment of the natural world and \"grudgingly admits\" that some disputes are inevitable to facilitate technological process. The film presents several themes similarly to the manga Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind, which Miyazaki had completed in 1994, namely the \"environmental catastrophe, the role of technology and warfare, and human interactions with nonhuman species\", according to Napier. In a 1998 interview at the Berlin International Film Festival, Miyazaki stated \"I meant to state my objection to the way environmental issues are treated.\"\nMichelle J. Smith and Elizabeth Parsons said that the film \"makes heroes of outsiders in all identity politics categories and blurs the stereotypes that usually define such characters\". In the case of the deer god's destruction of the forest and Tataraba, Smith and Parsons said that the \"supernatural forces of destruction are unleashed by humans greedily consuming natural resources\". Deidre M. Pike writes that San is simultaneously part of nature and part of the problem. She represents the connection between the environment and humans, but also demonstrates that there is an imbalance in power between the two.\nAccording to the Chicago Sun-Times's Roger Ebert, \"It is not a simplistic tale of good and evil, but the story of how humans, forest animals and nature gods all fight for their share of the new emerging order.\" Anime historian Susan J. Napier said there is no clear good vs. evil conflict in Princess Mononoke, unlike other films popular with children. Based on the multiple points of view the film adopts, San and Lady Eboshi can simultaneously be viewed as heroic or villainous. San defends the forest and viewers empathize with her. But she also attacks innocent people, complicating how we evaluate her. Opposed to San, Eboshi tries to destroy the forest and could be considered a villain. But everything she does is out of a desire to protect her village and see it prosper. San and Lady Eboshi survive until film's end, defying the usual convention of good triumphing over evil with the antagonist defeated. Napier concluded that the resolution of the conflict is left ambiguous, implying that Lady Eboshi and San will be able to come to some sort of compromise. The ambiguity suggests that there are no true villains or heroes.\nAccording to media arts scholar Benjamin Thevenin, duality is central to Eboshi's characterization. She holds no inherent malicious intent toward nature and its spirits, as evidenced by the garden she keeps in Irontown, until they begin attacking her people. Irontown itself is a haven for downtrodden members of society, who Eboshi treats equally. In a speech in 2016, Miyazaki explained that he was inspired to portray people living with leprosy, \"said to be an incurable disease caused by bad karma\", after visiting the Tama Zenshoen Sanatorium near his home in Tokyo. According to media and literature scholars Sierra et al., Eboshi is driven by her compassion for the disabled, and believes that blood from the Great Forest Spirit could allow her to \"cure [her] poor lepers\".\nDan Jolin of Empire said that a potential theme could be that of lost innocence. Miyazaki attributes this to his experience of making his previous film, Porco Rosso, and the wars in the former Yugoslavia, which he cites as an example of mankind never learning, making it difficult for him to go back to making a film such as Kiki's Delivery Service, where he has been quoted as saying \"It felt like children were being born to this world without being blessed. How could we pretend to them that we're happy?\"\n\nStyle\nPrincess Mononoke marked the first time Miyazaki explored a jidaigeki style \u2013 a period drama focusing on the lives of historic Japanese peoples. According to Napier, the film presents a much \"grimmer\" tone than his previous works, inspired by Japanese literary classic H\u014dj\u014dki (1212). The film also subverts many traditional elements of the jidaigeki genre, such as the portrayals of the Emperor and the samurai as sacred and noble. Additionally, Miyazaki chooses not to follow typical depictions of the Muromachi period such as the development of high culture or Zen aesthetics in Kyoto, opting to focus on the beauty and danger of the natural landscape. However, according to animation scholar Helen McCarthy, Miyazaki was drawn to the period as the Japanese people \"began to feel they could control nature, rather than placate or worship it\".\n\nMusic\nAs with many of Miyazaki's previous films, the film's score was composed by Joe Hisaishi. According to McCarthy, the development of the score involved a much closer collaboration between the two than on previous works. Hisaishi first composed an image album \u2013 a collection of demos and musical sketches that serve as a precursor to the finished score \u2013 which was then reworked into the final score, performed by the Tokyo City Philharmonic. Tokuma Shoten released the image album in July 1996 and the soundtrack album in July 1997. A third version of the soundtrack, arranged for symphony orchestra and performed by the Czech Philharmonic, was released in 1998.\n\nRelease\nPrincess Mononoke was released theatrically in Japan on July 12, 1997.\nSince Walt Disney Studios had made a distribution deal with Tokuma Shoten for Studio Ghibli's films in 1996, it was the first film from Studio Ghibli along with Castle in the Sky (1986) and Kiki's Delivery Service (1989) to have been dubbed into English by Disney.\nThe film was aired on Nippon TV in Japan on January 22, 1999. It reached a 35.1% audience share, making it the broadcaster's second-most-viewed film at the time behind Spirited Away (2001).\nOn April 29, 2000, the English version of Princess Mononoke was released theatrically in Japan along with the documentary Mononoke hime in U.S. The film had a limited theatrical re-release in the United States during July 2018, and again during April 2022 for the 25th anniversary of its original Japanese release.\n\nBox office\nPrincess Mononoke was the highest-grossing Japanese film of 1997, earning \u00a511.3 billion in distribution rental earnings. It became the highest-grossing film in Japan, beating the record set by E.T. in 1982, but was surpassed several months later by Titanic. The film earned total domestic gross receipts of \u00a520.18 billion. The film remained in the top 5 films at the box office for 22 weeks.\nIt was the highest-grossing anime film in the United States in January 2001, but because its US release was only in select theaters, the film did not fare as well financially in the country when released in October 1999. It grossed US$2.2 million in its first eight weeks. The film earned a total of US$11 million outside Japan, bringing its worldwide total to US$159 million at the time. On December 6, 2016, GKIDS announced that it would screen the film in US cinemas on January 5 and January 9, 2017 to celebrate its 20th anniversary, bundled with the On Your Mark short. The film's limited US re-release in 2018 grossed US$1.4 million over five days, bringing its US total to US$3.7 million and worldwide total to US$160 million. As of 2020, the film has grossed US$194.3 million.\nFor its 25th anniversary, the film was screened at New York City's Japan Society on July 22, 2022.\n\nHome media\nIn Japan, the film was released on VHS by Buena Vista Home Entertainment in 1997, as well as by Tokuma Shoten in 1998. By 2007, Princess Mononoke sold 4.4 million DVD units in Japan.\nThe DVD release of Princess Mononoke in North America was not initially to include the Japanese audio track. Multiple online petitions were opened to retain it, and the original August 2000 release was delayed as a result. Miramax Home Entertainment released the DVD on December 19, 2000, with the original Japanese audio, the English dubbed audio and extras including a trailer and a documentary with interviews from the English dub voice actors. It would then have its sell-through VHS release on March 13, 2001.\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released Princess Mononoke on Blu-ray on November 18, 2014. In its first week, it sold 21,860 units; by November 23, 2014, it had grossed US$502,332. It was later included in Disney's \"The Collected Works of Hayao Miyazaki\" Blu-ray set, released on November 17, 2015. GKIDS re-issued the film on Blu-ray and DVD on October 17, 2017. As of October 2020, the film has grossed US$9.2 million from Blu-ray sales in the United States.\nIn the United Kingdom, the film's Studio Ghibli anniversary release appeared several times on the annual lists of bestselling foreign language film on home video, ranking number three in 2019, below Spirited Away (2001) and My Neighbor Totoro (1988).\n\nEnglish dub\nIn response to demands from Miramax chairman Harvey Weinstein to edit the film, producer Toshio Suzuki presented Weinstein a prop sword with the verbal message \"Mononoke Hime, no cut!\". Promotion manager Steve Alpert revealed that Weinstein had wanted to trim the film down from 135 minutes to 90 minutes \"despite having promised not to do so\". Weinstein hired Neil Gaiman to write the English script. Despite Gaiman's independent fame as an author, his role as scriptwriter for the dub was not heavily promoted; Studio Ghibli requested that Miramax remove some executives' names from the poster for the film.\n\nReception\nCritical response\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 93% of 117 critic reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.1\/10. The website's consensus reads, \"With its epic story and breathtaking visuals, Princess Mononoke is a landmark in the world of animation.\" On Metacritic, it has an average score of 76 out of 100 based on 29 reviews, indictating \"generally favorable reviews\".\nThe Daily Yomiuri's Aaron Gerow called the film a \"powerful compilation of Miyazaki's world, a cumulative statement of his moral and filmic concerns.\" Leonard Klady of Variety said that Princess Mononoke \"is not only more sharply drawn, it has an extremely complex and adult script\" and the film \"has the soul of a romantic epic, and its lush tones, elegant score by Joe Hisaishi and full-blooded characterizations give it the sweep of cinema's most grand canvases\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times called Princess Mononoke \"a great achievement and a wonderful experience, and one of the best films of the year.\" Ty Burr of Entertainment Weekly called the film \"a windswept pinnacle of its art\" and that it \"has the effect of making the average Disney film look like just another toy story\". Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said that the film \"brings a very different sensibility to animation, a medium [Miyazaki] views as completely suitable for straight dramatic narrative and serious themes.\" In his review, Dave Smith from Gamers' Republic called it \"one of the greatest animated films ever created, and easily one of the best films of 1999\".\nIn 2001, Animage ranked Princess Mononoke 47th in their list of the 100 best anime. It ranked 488th on Empire's list of the 500 greatest films. Time Out ranked the film 26th on 50 greatest animated films. It also ranked 26 on Total Film's list of 50 greatest animated films.\n\nAccolades\nPrincess Mononoke is the first animated feature film to win the Japan Academy Prize for Best Picture. For the 70th Academy Awards ceremony, Princess Mononoke was the Japanese submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but was not successfully nominated. Hayao Miyazaki was also nominated for an Annie Award for his work on the film.\n\nLegacy\nAccording to Napier, Princess Mononoke is \"considered by many to be Miyazaki's most important work\". The film's release was a \"cultural phenomenon\" in Japan, breaking box office records previously held only by Hollywood films, which Denison feels was \"reflective of a general trend towards the globalization of anime\".\nJames Cameron cited Princess Mononoke as an influence on his 2009 film Avatar. He acknowledged that it shares themes with Princess Mononoke, including its clash between cultures and civilizations, and cited Princess Mononoke as an influence on the ecosystem of Pandora.\n\nStage adaptation\nIn 2012, it was announced that Studio Ghibli and British theater company Whole Hog Theatre would be bringing Princess Mononoke to the stage. It is the first stage adaptation of a Studio Ghibli work. The contact between Whole Hog Theatre and Studio Ghibli was facilitated by Nick Park of Aardman Animations after he sent footage of Whole Hog performances to Studio Ghibli's Toshio Suzuki. The play features large puppets made out of recycled and reclaimed materials.\nThe first performances were scheduled for London's New Diorama Theatre and sold out in 72 hours, a year in advance. In March 2013, it was announced that the show would transfer to Japan after its first run of shows in London. A second series of performances followed in London after the return from Tokyo. The second run of London performances sold out in four and half hours. The play received positive reviews and was one of Lyn Gardner's theater picks in The Guardian.\n\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\nBook and journal sources\nOnline and other sources\nFurther reading\nCheng, Catherine (June 2019). \"Nature and the Smiths in Hayao Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke\" (PDF).

The plot derives from William Shakespeare's King Lear and includes segments based on legends of the daimy\u014d M\u014dri Motonari. The film stars Tatsuya Nakadai as Hidetora Ichimonji, an aging Sengoku-period warlord who decides to abdicate as ruler in favor of his three sons.\nLike most of Kurosawa's work in the 1970s and 80s, Ran is an international production, in this case a Japanese-French venture produced by Herald Ace, Nippon Herald Films, and Greenwich Film Productions. Production planning went through a long period of preparation. Kurosawa conceived the idea of Ran in the mid-1970s, when he read about Motonari, who was famous for having three highly loyal sons. Kurosawa devised a plot in which the sons become antagonists of their father. Although the film became heavily inspired by Shakespeare's play King Lear, Kurosawa began using it only after he had started preparations for Ran. Following these preparations, Kurosawa filmed Dersu Uzala in 1975, followed by Kagemusha in the early 1980s, before securing financial backing to film Ran.\nRan was Kurosawa's third encounter with Shakespeare during his career. In 1957, Kurosawa directed Throne of Blood, based on Shakespeare's Macbeth. In 1960, he directed the film The Bad Sleep Well, based on Hamlet. Despite the changes in setting and language, all three films have received critical acclaim.\nAs Kurosawa's last epic, Ran has often been cited as among his finest achievements and is widely regarded as one of the greatest films ever made. With a budget of $11\u201312 million, it was the most expensive film in the history of Japanese cinema upon its release. Ran was previewed on  May 31, 1985, at the Tokyo International Film Festival before its release on June 1, 1985, in Japan. The film was hailed for its powerful images and use of color;  costume designer Emi Wada won an Academy Award for Best Costume Design for her work on Ran, and Kurosawa received his only career nomination for Best Director. The distinctive film score, inspired by Gustav Mahler, was composed by Toru Takemitsu.\n\nPlot\nHidetora Ichimonji, a powerful but elderly warlord, decides to divide his kingdom among his three sons: Taro, Jiro, and Saburo. Taro, the eldest, will receive the prestigious First Castle and become leader of the Ichimonji clan, while Jiro and Saburo will be given the Second and Third Castles. Hidetora is to retain the title of Great Lord and Jiro and Saburo are to support Taro. However, Saburo is exiled after criticizing his father's lecture about unity. Hidetora's servant Tango is also exiled for defending Saburo.\nFollowing the division of Hidetora's lands between his remaining two sons, Taro's wife, Lady Kaede, still bitter about Hidetora killing her family and taking their land, successfully urges him to usurp control of the entire Ichimonji clan. When Taro demands Hidetora renounce his title, Hidetora leaves and travels to Jiro's castle, only to discover that Jiro is only interested in using Hidetora as a titular pawn. As Hidetora and his retinue wander, Tango warns Hidetora of Taro's new decree: death to whoever aids his father. Hidetora plans to take refuge in the Third Castle, which was abandoned by Saburo's forces (who followed him into exile) and taken over by Taro's general Ogura. Hidetora feels they can take Ogura easily, whereas Kyoami, the court fool, jokes about Hidetora's predicament, and is yelled at by Hidetora to stay behind if he's afraid. Kyoami and Tango stay outside while Hidetora and the rest of his retinue take refuge in the Third Castle, which they find unoccupied.\nLater, Hidetora and his retinue are attacked by Taro and Jiro's combined forces - Taro's men had \"abandoned\" the castle to lure Hidetora into a false sense of security and ambush him. Taro is killed by a bullet fired by Jiro's general, Kurogane. All of Hidetora's retinue are either killed or commit ritual suicide. Hidetora is allowed to survive and succumbs to madness as he wanders away from the destroyed castle. Kyoami and Tango, still loyal to Hidetora, find him and stay to assist. Hidetora is haunted by visions of the people he killed in the past. They take refuge in a peasant's home only to discover that the occupant is Tsurumaru, the brother of Lady Sue, Jiro's wife. Tsurumaru's eyes were gouged out by Hidetora's forces and he was left impoverished due to Hidetora's siege. With Taro dead, Jiro becomes the Great Lord of the Ichimonji clan, and moves into the First Castle. Lady Kaede manipulates Jiro into having an affair with her, and demands that he kill Lady Sue, and marry her instead. Jiro orders Kurogane to do the deed, but he refuses, seeing through Kaede's perfidy. Kurogane then warns Sue and Tsurumaru to flee. Tango encounters former spies and before killing them, he is informed that Jiro is considering sending assassins after Hidetora. Tango rides off to alert Saburo. As his madness grows, Hidetora runs off into a volcanic plain.\nAfter Saburo's army enters Jiro's territory to find Hidetora, Jiro hastily mobilizes his army. After a truce, Saburo learns from Kyoami of Hidetora's potential location. After Saburo leaves, Jiro attacks Saburo's smaller forces, suffering losses, and orders his remaining forces to retreat after learning of another army marching on the First Castle. Saburo finds Hidetora, who partially recovers his sanity, and reconciles with Saburo. However, Saburo is killed by one of Jiro's snipers. Hidetora dies from grief. Tsurumaru and Sue arrive at the ruins of a castle, but inadvertently leave behind the flute that Sue gave him when he was banished. She gives him a picture of Amida Buddha for protection while she attempts to retrieve the flute. However, she never returns.\nAs the First Castle is besieged, Kurogane learns of Sue's death, and confronts Kaede. After she confesses her plot was revenge against the Ichimonji clan, she is killed by Kurogane. Jiro, Kurogane, and all Jiro's men subsequently die in battle. A funeral procession is held for Saburo and Hidetora. Meanwhile, left alone in the castle ruins, Tsurumaru trips, dropping the Amida Buddha image Sue had given to him. The film ends with a distant shot of Tsurumaru silhouetted against the castle's landscape atop the ruins.\n\nCast\nProduction\nRan was Kurosawa's last epic film and by far his most expensive. At the time, its budget of $11\u201312 million made it the most expensive Japanese film in history, leading to its distribution in 1985 exceeding the budget of $7.5 million for his previous film Kagemusha. It is a Japanese-French venture produced by Herald Ace, Nippon Herald Films, and Greenwich Film Productions. Filming started in 1983. The 1,400 uniforms and suits of armor used for the extras were designed by costume designer Emi Wada and Kurosawa, and were handmade by master tailors over more than two years. The film also used 200 horses. Kurosawa loved filming in lush and expansive locations, and most of Ran was shot amidst the mountains and plains of Mount Aso, Japan's largest active volcano. Kurosawa was granted permission to shoot at two of the country's most famous landmarks, the ancient castles at Kumamoto and Himeji. For the castle of Lady Sue's family, he used the ruins of the custom-constructed Azusa castle, made by Kurosawa's production crew near Mount Fuji. Hidetora's third castle, which was burned to the ground, was a real building which Kurosawa built on the slopes of Mount Fuji. No miniatures were used for that segment, and Tatsuya Nakadai had to do the scene where Hidetora flees the castle in one take.  Kurosawa also filmed a scene that required an entire field to be sprayed gold, but cut it out of the final film during editing. The documentary A.K. shows the filming of the scene.\nKurosawa often shot scenes with three cameras simultaneously, each using different lenses and angles. Many long-shots were employed and very few close-ups. On several occasions, Kurosawa used static cameras and suddenly brought the action into frame, rather than using the camera to track the action. He also used jump cuts to progress certain scenes, changing the pace of the action for filmic effect.\nAkira Kurosawa's wife of 39 years, Y\u014dko Yaguchi, died during the production of the film. He halted filming for one day to mourn before resuming work. His regular recording engineer Fumio Yanoguchi also died late in production in January 1985.\n\nCrew\nPersonnel taken from The Criterion Collection.\n\nDevelopment\nKurosawa conceived of the idea that became Ran in the mid-1970s, when he read a parable about the Sengoku-period warlord M\u014dri Motonari. Motonari was famous for having three sons, all incredibly loyal and talented. Kurosawa began imagining what would have happened had they been bad. Although the film eventually became heavily inspired by Shakespeare's play King Lear, Kurosawa became aware of the play only after he had started pre-planning. According to him, the stories of M\u014dri Motonari and Lear merged in a way he was never fully able to explain. He wrote the script shortly after filming Dersu Uzala in 1975, and then \"let it sleep\" for seven years. During this time, he painted storyboards of every shot in the film (later included with the screenplay and available on the Criterion Collection DVD release) and then continued searching for funding. Following his success with 1980's Kagemusha, which he later considered a \"dress rehearsal\" or \"dry run\" for Ran, Kurosawa was finally able to secure backing from French producer Serge Silberman.\nKurosawa once said \"Hidetora is me\", and there is evidence in the film that Hidetora serves as a stand-in for Kurosawa. Roger Ebert agrees, arguing that Ran \"may be as much about Kurosawa's life as Shakespeare's play\". Ran was the final film of Kurosawa's \"third period\" (1965\u20131985), a time where he had difficulty securing support for his pictures, and was frequently forced to seek foreign financial backing. While he had directed over twenty films in the first two decades of his career, he directed just four in these two decades. After directing Red Beard (1965), Kurosawa discovered that he was considered old-fashioned and did not work again for almost five years. He also found himself competing against television, which had reduced Japanese film audiences from a high of 1.1 billion in 1958 to under 200 million by 1975. In 1968, he was fired from the 20th Century Fox epic Tora! Tora! Tora! over what he described as creative differences, but others said was a perfectionism that bordered on insanity. Kurosawa tried to start an independent production group with three other directors, but his 1970 film Dodes'ka-den was a box-office flop and bankrupted the company.  Many of his younger rivals boasted that he was finished. A year later, unable to secure any domestic funding and plagued by ill health, Kurosawa attempted suicide by slashing his wrists. Though he survived, his misfortune continued to plague him until the late 1980s. According to Stephen Prince, medical treatment and Mosfilm's offer to make a film in Russia (Dersu Uzala) helped Kurosawa's eventual \"spiritual recovery.\" \nKurosawa was influenced by the William Shakespeare play King Lear and borrowed elements from it. Both depict an aging warlord who decides to divide up his kingdom among his children. Hidetora has three sons \u2013 Taro, Jiro, and Saburo \u2013 who correspond to Lear's daughters Goneril, Regan, and Cordelia. In both, the warlord foolishly banishes anyone who disagrees with him as a matter of pride \u2013 in Lear it is the Earl of Kent and Cordelia; in Ran it is Tango and Saburo. The conflict in both is that two of the lord's children ultimately turn against him, while the third supports him, though Hidetora's sons are far more ruthless than Goneril and Regan. Both King Lear and Ran end with the death of the entire family, including the lord.\nThere are some crucial differences between the two stories. King Lear is a play about undeserved suffering, and Lear himself is at worst a fool. Hidetora, by contrast, has been a cruel warrior for most of his life: a man who ruthlessly murdered men, women, and children to achieve his goals.  In Ran, Lady Kaede, Lady Sue, and Tsurumaru were all victims of Hidetora. Whereas in King Lear the character of Gloucester had his eyes gouged out by Lear's enemies, in Ran it was Hidetora himself who gave the order to blind Tsurumaru. The role of the Fool has been expanded into a major character (Kyoami). Kurosawa was concerned that Shakespeare gave his characters no past, and he wanted to give his version of King Lear a history.\nThe complex and variant etymology for the word Ran used as the title has been variously translated as \"chaos\", \"rebellion\", or \"revolt\"; or to mean \"disturbed\" or \"confused\".\n\nFilming\nThe filming of Ran began in 1983. The development and conception of the filming of the war scenes in the film were influenced by Kurosawa's opinions on nuclear warfare. According to Michael Wilmington, Kurosawa told him that much of the film was a metaphor for nuclear warfare and the anxiety of the post-Hiroshima age. He believed that, despite all of the technological progress of the 20th century, all people had learned was how to kill each other more efficiently.  In Ran, the vehicle for apocalyptic destruction is the arquebus, an early firearm that was introduced to Japan in the 16th century. Arquebuses revolutionized samurai warfare. Kurosawa had already dealt with this theme in his previous film Kagemusha, in which the Takeda cavalry is destroyed by the arquebuses of the Oda and Tokugawa clans.\nIn Ran, the battle of Hachiman Field is an illustration of this new kind of warfare. Saburo's arquebusiers annihilate Jiro's cavalry and drive off his infantry by engaging them from the woods, where the cavalry are unable to venture. Similarly, Taro and Saburo's assassination by a sniper also shows how individual heroes can be easily disposed of on a modern battlefield. Kurosawa also illustrates this new warfare with his camera. Instead of focusing on the warring armies, he frequently sets the focal plane beyond the action, so that in the film they appear as abstract entities.\n\nCasting\nThe description of Hidetora in the first script was originally based on Toshiro Mifune. However, the role was cast to Tatsuya Nakadai, an actor who had played several supporting and major characters in previous Kurosawa films, such as Shingen and his double in Kagemusha. Other Kurosawa veterans in Ran were Masayuki Yui (Tango), Jinpachi Nezu (Jiro) and Daisuke Ryu (Saburo), all of whom were in Kagemusha. For Akira Terao (Taro) and Mieko Harada (Lady Kaede), Ran was their first Kurosawa film, but they would go on to work with him again in Dreams. Hisashi Igawa (Kurogane), who had previously been in Kurosawa's Dodes'ka-den, would reappear in both Dreams and Rhapsody in August. Kurosawa also hired two popular entertainers for supporting roles: singer-dancer Shinnosuke \"Peter\" Ikehata as Hidetora's loyal fool Kyoami and comedian-musician Hitoshi Ueki as rival warlord Nobuhiro Fujimaki. About 1,400 extras were employed.\n\nActing style\nWhile most of the characters in Ran are portrayed by conventional acting techniques, two performances are reminiscent of Japanese Noh theatre. Noh is a form of Japanese traditional theatre requiring highly-trained actors and musicians where emotions are primarily conveyed by stylized conventional gestures. The heavy, ghost-like make-up worn by Tatsuya Nakadai's character, Hidetora, resembles the emotive masks worn by traditional Noh performers. The body language exhibited by the same character is also typical of Noh theatre: long periods of static motion and silence, followed by an abrupt, sometimes violent, change in stance. The character of Lady Kaede is also Noh-influenced. The Noh treatment emphasizes the ruthless, passionate, and single-minded natures of these two characters.\n\nMusic\nCraig Lysy, writing for Movie Music UK, commented on the strengths of the film soundtrack's composer for Kurosawa's purposes: \"T\u014dru Takemitsu was Japan's preeminent film score composer and Kurosawa secured his involvement in 1976, during the project's early stages. Their initial conception of the score was to use tategoe, a \"shrill-voice\" chant style without instrumentation. Over the intervening years, Kurosawa's conception of the score changed dramatically. As they began production his desire had changed 180 degrees, now insisting on a powerful Mahleresque orchestral score. Takemitsu responded with what many describe as his most romantic effort, one that achieved a perfect blending of Oriental and Occidental sensibilities.\"\nTakemitsu has stated that he was significantly influenced by the Japanese karmic concept of ma, interpreted as a surplus of energy surrounding an abundant void. As Lysy stated: \"Takemitsu was guided in his efforts best summed up in the Japanese word ma, which suggests the incongruity of a void abounding with energy. He related: 'My music is like a garden, and I am the gardener. Listening to my music can be compared with walking through a garden and experiencing the changes in light, pattern and texture.'\"\nThe project was the second of two which allowed Kurosawa and Takemitsu to collaborate, the first being Dodes'ka-den in 1970. Lysy summarized the second project stating: \"the collaboration between Kurosawa and the temperamental Takemitsu was rocky. Kurosawa constantly sent Takemitsu notes, which only served to infuriate him, so he frequently visited the set to gain a direct sensual experience. Takemitsu actually resigned... Fortunately, producer Masato Hara intervened, made peace, and Takemitsu returned to the film. Years later, Takemitsu would relate: \"Overall, I still have this feeling of ... 'Oh, if only he'd left more up to me' ... But seeing it now ... I guess it's fine the way it is.'\"\nKurosawa originally had wanted the London Symphony Orchestra to perform the score for Ran, but upon meeting conductor Hiroyuki Iwaki of the Sapporo Symphony Orchestra, he engaged Iwaki and the orchestra to record it. Kurosawa had the orchestra play up to 40 takes of the music. The running time of the soundtrack is just over an hour and was re-released in 2016 after its original release in 1985 by Silva Screen Productions. It was produced by Reynold da Silva and David Stoner.\n\nReception\nBox office\nReleased on June 1, 1985, it was modestly successful financially in Japan. It earned \u00a52.51 billion ($12 million) in Japan, just enough to break even. In France, where it released on 18 September 1985, the film sold 813,081 tickets, grossing an estimated 24,392,430 F ($2,439,243).\nIn the United States, where it released in December 1985, the film grossed $3,763,760 in its first four weeks of release. Later re-releases between 2000 and 2016 grossed $528,357 in the United States and Canada, bringing its total North American gross to $4,292,117.\nIn Germany, where it released in 1986, the film sold 222,862 tickets, grossing an estimated \u20ac735,440 ($714,912). The film also grossed $18,692 in the United Kingdom, and $16,215 in Portugal, bringing the film's total estimated gross to approximately $19,481,179 (equivalent to $55,000,000 in 2023) worldwide.\n\nCritical reviews\nRan was critically acclaimed upon its premiere. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 96%, based on 89 reviews, and an average rating of 9\/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Akira Kurosawa's sprawling, epic take on King Lear should be required viewing for fans of westerns, war movies, or period films in general.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 97 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\nShawn Levy, of the Portland Oregonian wrote, \"In many respects, it's Kurosawa's most sumptuous film, a feast of color, motion and sound: Considering that its brethren include Kagemusha, Seven Samurai and Dersu Uzala, the achievement is extraordinary.\" Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert said, \"Ran is a great, glorious achievement.\" In the San Francisco Examiner, G. Allen Johnson stated: \"Kurosawa pulled out all the stops with Ran, his obsession with loyalty and his love of expressionistic film techniques allowed to roam freely.\"\nWriting for the San Francisco Chronicle, Bob Graham stated: \"In Ran, the horrors of life are transformed by art into beauty. It is finally so moving that the only appropriate response is silence.\" Gene Siskel, writing for the Chicago Tribune, wrote: \"The physical scale of Ran is overwhelming. It's almost as if Kurosawa is saying to all the cassette buyers of America, in a play on Clint Eastwood's phrase, 'Go ahead, ruin your night' \u2013 wait to see my film on a small screen and cheat yourself out of what a movie can be.\" Vincent Canby, writing for The New York Times, stated: \"Though big in physical scope and of a beauty that suggests a kind of drunken, barbaric lyricism, Ran has the terrible logic and clarity of a morality tale seen in tight close-up, of a myth that, while being utterly specific and particular in its time and place, remains ageless, infinitely adaptable.\"\nRoger Ebert awarded the film four out of four stars, with extended commentary, \"Kurosawa (while directing Ran) often must have associated himself with the old lord as he tried to put this film together, but in the end he has triumphed, and the image I have of him, at 75, is of three arrows bundled together.\" In 2000, it was inducted into Ebert's Great Movies list.\nNotoriously acerbic critic John Simon of the National Review wrote, \"I find it as an almost total failure by a genius in his old age\".\nMichal Sragow, writing for Salon in 2000, summarized the Shakespearean origins of the play: \"Kurosawa's Lear is a 16th century warlord who has three sons and a career studded with conquests. Kurosawa's genius is to tell his story so that every step suggests how wild and savage a journey it has been. At the start, this bold, dominating figure, now called Hidetora, is a sacred monster who wants to be a sort of warlord emeritus. He hopes to bequeath power to his oldest son while retaining his own entourage and emblems of command. He hasn't reckoned with the ambition of his successor or the manipulative skill of his heir's wife, who goes for the sexual and political jugular of anyone who invades her sphere.\" In 2009, the film was voted at No. 59 on the list of The Greatest Japanese Films of All Time by Japanese film magazine Kinema Junpo.\n\nAccolades\nRan was completed too late to be entered at Cannes and had its premiere at Japan's first Tokyo International Film Festival. Kurosawa skipped the film's premiere, angering many in the Japanese film industry. As a result, it was not submitted as Japan's entry for the Best Foreign Language Film category of the Oscars. Serge Silberman tried to get it nominated as a French co-production but failed. However, American director Sidney Lumet helped organize a campaign to have Kurosawa nominated as Best Director.\nRan was nominated for the Academy Awards for art direction, cinematography, costume design (which it won), and Kurosawa's direction. It was also nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. In Japan, Ran was conspicuously not nominated for \"Best Picture\" at the Awards of the Japanese Academy. However, it won two prizes, for best art direction and best music score, and received four other nominations, for best cinematography, best lighting, best sound, and best supporting actor (Hitoshi Ueki, who played Saburo's patron, Lord Fujimaki). Ran won two awards from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, for best foreign language film and best make-up artist, and was nominated for best cinematography, best costume design, best production design, and best screenplay\u2013adapted. Despite its limited commercial success at the time of its release, the film's accolades have improved greatly, and it is now regarded as one of Kurosawa's masterpieces.\nRan won Best Director and Best Foreign Film awards from the National Board of Review, a Best Film award and a Best Cinematography award (Takao Sait\u014d, Sh\u014dji Ueda, and Asakazu Nakai) from the National Society of Film Critics, a Best Foreign Language Film award from the New York Film Critics Circle, a Best Music award (Toru Takemitsu) and a Best Foreign Film award from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, a Best Film award and a Best Cinematography award from the Boston Society of Film Critics, a Best Foreign Feature award from the Amanda Awards from Norway, a Blue Ribbon Award for Best Film, a Best European Film award from the Bodil Awards, a Best Foreign Director award from the David di Donatello Awards, a Joseph Plateau Award for Best Artistic Contribution, a Director of the Year award and a Foreign Language Film of the Year award from the London Critics Circle Film Awards, a Best Film, a Best Supporting Actor (Hisashi Igawa) and a Best Director from the Mainichi Film Concours, and an OCIC award from the San Sebastian Film Festival.\nIn the British Film Institute's 2002 Sight & Sound polls of the greatest films ever made, Ran ranked 41st in director's poll. In 2007, the film was ranked at No. 28 by The Guardian's readers' poll on its list of \"40 greatest foreign films of all time\". The film was selected in BBC's list of 100 greatest foreign language films by 209 critics of 43 countries around the world in 2018.\n\nSee also\nList of historical drama films of Asia\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nConrad, David A.

Starring Toshiro Mifune, Machiko Ky\u014d, Masayuki Mori, and Takashi Shimura, it follows various people who describe how a samurai was murdered in a forest. The plot and characters are based upon Ry\u016bnosuke Akutagawa's short story \"In a Grove\", with the title and framing story taken from Akutagawa's \"Rash\u014dmon\". Every element is largely identical, from the murdered samurai speaking through a Shinto psychic to the bandit in the forest, the monk, the assault of the wife, and the dishonest retelling of the events in which everyone shows their ideal self by lying.\nProduction began in 1948 at Kurosawa's regular production firm Toho but was canceled as it was viewed as a financial risk. Two years later, S\u014djir\u014d Motoki pitched Rashomon to Daiei Film upon the completion of Kurosawa's Scandal. Daiei initially turned it down but eventually agreed to produce and distribute the film. Principal photography lasted from July 7 to August 17, 1950, taking place primarily in Kyoto on an estimated \u00a515\u201320 million budget. When creating the film's visual style, Kurosawa and cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa experimented with various methods such as pointing the camera at the sun, which was considered taboo. Post-production took only one week and was decelerated by two fires.\nRashomon premiered at the Imperial Theatre on August 25, 1950, and was distributed throughout Japan the following day, to moderate commercial success, becoming Daiei's fourth highest-grossing film of 1950. Japanese critics praised the experimental direction and cinematography but criticized its adapting of Akutagawa's story and complexity. Upon winning the Golden Lion at the 12th Venice International Film Festival, Rashomon became the first Japanese film to attain significant international reception, garnering critical acclaim and earning roughly $800,000 abroad. It later won Best Foreign Language Film at the 24th Academy Awards, and was nominated for Best Film at the 6th British Academy Film Awards.\nRashomon is now considered one of the greatest films ever made and among the most influential movies from the 20th century. It pioneered the Rashomon effect, a plot device that involves various characters providing subjective, alternative, and contradictory versions of the same incident. In 1998, critic Andrew Johnston asserted that \"the film's title has become synonymous with its chief narrative conceit\".\n\nPlot\nIn Heian-era Kyoto, a woodcutter and a priest, taking shelter from a downpour under the Rash\u014dmon city gate, recount a story of a recent assault and murder. Baffled at conflicting accounts of the same event, the woodcutter and the priest are joined by a commoner. The woodcutter claims he had found the body of a murdered samurai three days earlier, alongside the samurai's cap, his wife's hat, cut pieces of rope, and an amulet. The priest claims he had seen the samurai travel with his wife on the day of the murder. Both testify in court before a policeman presents the main suspect, a captured bandit named Taj\u014dmaru.\nIn Taj\u014dmaru's version of events, he follows the couple after spotting them traveling in the woods. He tricks the samurai into leaving the trail by lying about finding a burial pit filled with ancient artifacts. He subdues the samurai and attempts to rape his wife, who tries to defend herself with a dagger. Taj\u014dmaru then seduces the wife, who, ashamed of the dishonor of having been with two men, asks Taj\u014dmaru to duel her husband so she may go with the man who wins. Taj\u014dmaru agrees; the duel ends with Taj\u014dmaru killing the samurai. He then finds the wife has fled.\nThe wife, having been found by the police, delivers a different testimony; in her version of events, Taj\u014dmaru leaves immediately after assaulting her. She frees her husband from his bonds, but he stares at her with contempt and loathing. The wife tries to threaten him with her dagger but then faints from panic. She awakens to find her husband dead, with the dagger in his chest. In shock, she wanders through the forest until coming upon a pond and attempts to drown herself but fails.\nThe samurai's testimony is heard through a medium. In his version of events, Taj\u014dmaru asks the wife to marry him after the assault. To the samurai's shame, she accepts, asking Taj\u014dmaru to kill the samurai first. This disgusts Taj\u014dmaru, who gives the samurai the choice to let her go or have her killed. The wife then breaks free and flees. Taj\u014dmaru unsuccessfully gives chase. After being set free by an apologetic Taj\u014dmaru, the samurai kills himself with the dagger. Later, he feels someone remove the dagger from his chest, but cannot tell who.\nThe woodcutter proclaims that all three stories are falsehoods and admits that he saw the samurai killed by a sword instead of a dagger. The commoner pressures the woodcutter to admit that he had seen the murder but lied to avoid getting in trouble. In the woodcutter's version of events, Taj\u014dmaru begs the wife to marry him. She instead frees her husband, expecting him to kill Taj\u014dmaru. The samurai refuses to fight, unwilling to risk his life for a ruined woman. Taj\u014dmaru rescinds his promise to marry the wife; the wife rebukes them both for failing to keep their promises. The two men unwillingly enter into a duel; the samurai is disarmed and begs for his life, and Taj\u014dmaru kills him. The wife flees, and Taj\u014dmaru steals the samurai's sword and limps away.\nThe woodcutter, the priest, and the commoner are interrupted by the sound of a crying baby. They find a child abandoned in a basket along with a kimono and an amulet; the commoner steals the items, for which the woodcutter rebukes him. The commoner deduces that the woodcutter had lied not because he feared getting in trouble, but because he had stolen the wife's dagger to sell for food.\nMeanwhile, the priest attempts to soothe the baby. The woodcutter attempts to take the child after the commoner's departure; the priest, having lost his faith in humanity after the events of the trial and the commoner's actions, recoils. The woodcutter explains that he intends to raise the child. Having seen the woodcutter's well-meaning intentions, the priest announces that his faith in men has been restored. As the woodcutter prepares to leave, the rain stops and the clouds part, revealing the sun.\n\nCast\nToshiro Mifune as Taj\u014dmaru, the bandit\nMasayuki Mori as Takehiro Kanazawa, the samurai\nMachiko Ky\u014d as Masago, Kanazawa's wife\nTakashi Shimura as the woodcutter\nMinoru Chiaki as the priest\nKichijir\u014d Ueda as the commoner\nNoriko Honma as the miko\nDaisuke Kat\u014d as the policeman\n\nProduction\nDevelopment\nAccording to Donald Richie, Akira Kurosawa began developing the film circa 1948, and both Kurosawa's regular production studio Toho and its financing company, Toyoko Company, refused to produce the film, with the latter fearing it would be a precarious production. Following the completion of Scandal, S\u014djir\u014d Motoki offered the script to Daiei who also initially rejected it.\n\nRegarding Rashomon, Kurosawa said: I like silent pictures and I always have... I wanted to restore some of this beauty. I thought of it, I remember in this way: one of the techniques of modern art is simplification, and that I must therefore simplify this film.\"\nAs with most films produced in post-war Japan, reports on the budget of Rashomon are scarce and differ. In 1952, Jitsugyo no Nihon Sha said that the film's production cost was \u00a520 million, and suggested that advertising and other expenses brought the overall budget to \u00a535 million. The following year, the National Board of Review reported that the $85,000 spent on Kurosawa's Ikiru (1952) was over twice the budget of Rashomon. According to the UNESCO in 1971, Rashomon had a budget of \u00a515 million or $42,000. Reports on the budget in Western currency vary: The Guinness Book of Movie Facts and Feats cited it as $40,000, The New York Times and Stuart Galbraith IV noted a reputed $140,000 figure, and a handful of other sources have claimed that it cost as high as $250,000. Jasper Sharp disputed the latter number in an article for the BBC, since it would have been equal to \u00a590 million at the time of the film's production. He added that it \"seems highly unlikely given that the 125 million yen, approximately $350,000, that Kurosawa subsequently spent on Seven Samurai four years later made this film by far the most expensive domestic production up to this point\".\n\nWriting\nKurosawa wrote the screenplay while stayed at a ryokan in Atami with his friend Ishir\u014d Honda, who was scripting The Blue Pearl (1951). The pair regularly commenced writing their respective films at 9:00 a.m. and would give feedback on each other's work after each completed roughly twenty pages. According to Honda, Kurosawa soon refused to read The Blue Pearl after a couple of days but \"of course, he still made me read his\".\n\nCasting\nKurosawa had initially wanted the cast of eight to consist entirely of previous collaborators, specifically counseling Toshiro Mifune and Takashi Shimura. He also suggested that Setsuko Hara\u2014who had played the lead in No Regrets for Our Youth (1946)\u2014portray the wife, but she was not cast since her brother-in-law, filmmaker Hisatora Kumagai, was against it; Hara would subsequently appear in Kurosawa's next film, The Idiot (1951). Daiei executives then recommended Machiko Ky\u014d, believing she would make the film easier to marketed. Kurosawa agreed to cast her upon seeing her show enthusiasm for the project by shaving her eyebrows before going for a make-up test.\n\nWhen Kurosawa shot Rashomon, the actors and the staff lived together, a system Kurosawa found beneficial. He recalls: We were a very small group and it was as though I was directing Rashomon every minute of the day and night. At times like this, you can talk everything over and get very close indeed.\n\nFilming\nDue to its small budget the film had only three sets: the gate; the forest scene; and the police courtyard. Filming began on 7 July 1950 and ended 17 August. After a week's work on post-production, it was released in Tokyo on 25 August.\nThe cinematographer, Kazuo Miyagawa, contributed numerous ideas, technical skill and expertise in support for what would be an experimental and influential approach to cinematography. For example, in one sequence, there is a series of single close-ups of the bandit, then the wife and then the husband, which then repeats to emphasize the triangular relationship between them.\nThe use of contrasting shots is another example of the film techniques used in Rashomon. According to Donald Richie, the length of time of the shots of the wife and of the bandit is the same when the bandit is acting barbarically and the wife is hysterically crazy.\nRashomon had camera shots that were directly into the sun. Kurosawa wanted to use natural light, but it was too weak; they solved the problem by using a mirror to reflect the natural light. The result makes the strong sunlight look as though it has traveled through the branches, hitting the actors. The rain in the scenes at the gate had to be tinted with black ink because camera lenses could not capture the water pumped through the hoses.\n\nLighting\nRobert Altman compliments Kurosawa's use of \"dappled\" light throughout the film, which gives the characters and settings further ambiguity. In his essay \"Rashomon\", Tadao Sato suggests that the film (unusually) uses sunlight to symbolize evil and sin in the film, arguing that the wife gives in to the bandit's desires when she sees the sun.\nProfessor Keiko I. McDonald opposes Sato's idea in her essay \"The Dialectic of Light and Darkness in Kurosawa's Rashomon.\" McDonald says the film conventionally uses light to symbolize \"good\" or \"reason\" and darkness to symbolize \"bad\" or \"impulse\". She interprets the scene mentioned by Sato differently, pointing out that the wife gives herself to the bandit when the sun slowly fades out. McDonald also reveals that Kurosawa was waiting for a big cloud to appear over Rashomon gate to shoot the final scene in which the woodcutter takes the abandoned baby home; Kurosawa wanted to show that there might be another dark rain any time soon, even though the sky is clear at this moment. McDonald regards it as unfortunate that the final scene appears optimistic because it was too sunny and clear to produce the effects of an overcast sky.\n\nPost-production\nStanley Kauffmann writes in The Impact of Rashomon that Kurosawa often shot a scene with several cameras at the same time, so that he could \"cut the film freely and splice together the pieces which have caught the action forcefully as if flying from one piece to another.\" Despite this, he also used short shots edited together that trick the audience into seeing one shot; Donald Richie says in his essay that \"there are 407 separate shots in the body of the film ... This is more than twice the number in the usual film, and yet these shots never call attention to themselves.\"\nDue to setbacks and some lost audio, the crew took the urgent step of bringing Mifune back to the studio after filming to record another line. Recording engineer Iwao \u014ctani added it to the film along with the music, using a different microphone.\nThe film was scored by Fumio Hayasaka, who is among the most respected of Japanese composers. At the director's request, he included Maurice Ravel's Bol\u00e9ro as the soundtrack during the woman's story.\n\nAllegorical and symbolic content\nThe film depicts the rape of a woman and the murder of her samurai husband through the widely differing accounts of four witnesses, including the bandit-rapist, the wife, the dead man (speaking through a medium), and lastly the woodcutter, the one witness who seems the most objective and least biased. The stories are mutually contradictory and even the final version may be seen as motivated by factors of ego and saving face. The actors kept approaching Kurosawa wanting to know the truth, and he claimed the point of the film was to be an exploration of multiple realities rather than an exposition of a particular truth. Later film and television use of the \"Rashomon effect\" focuses on revealing \"the truth\" in a now conventional technique that presents the final version of a story as the truth, an approach that only matches Kurosawa's film on the surface.\nDue to its emphasis on the subjectivity of truth and the uncertainty of factual accuracy, Rashomon has been read by some as an allegory of the defeat of Japan at the end of World War II. James F. Davidson's article, \"Memory of Defeat in Japan: A Reappraisal of Rashomon\" in the December 1954 issue of the Antioch Review, is an early analysis of the World War II defeat elements. Another allegorical interpretation of the film is mentioned briefly in a 1995 article, \"Japan: An Ambivalent Nation, an Ambivalent Cinema\" by David M. Desser. Here, the film is seen as an allegory of the atomic bomb and Japanese defeat. It also briefly mentions James Goodwin's view on the influence of post-war events on the film. However, the film's source material, \"In a Grove\", was published in 1922, so any postwar allegory would have resulted from Kurosawa's additions rather than the story about the conflicting accounts. Historian and critic David Conrad has noted that the use of rape as a plot point came at a time when American occupation authorities had recently stopped censoring Japanese media and belated accounts of rapes by occupation troops began to appear in Japanese newspapers. Moreover, Kurosawa and other filmmakers were not allowed to make jidaigeki during the early part of the occupation, so setting a film in the distant past was a way to reassert domestic control over cinema.\n\nRelease\nBox office\nThe premiere of Rashomon took place at the Imperial Theatre on August 25, 1950, in Tokyo, and was distributed nationwide by Daiei the next day. It was an instant box office success, leading several theaters to continue to play it for two or three weeks rather than a Japanese film's regular one-week theatrical run. Jiji Press reported that the film was Daiei's third highest-grossing film released between September 1949 and August 1950, having earned over \u00a510 million. In general, the film was Daiei's fourth-highest-grossing film of 1950. Donald Richie claimed that it was also one of the top ten highest-earning films in Japan that year.\nThe film later became Kurosawa's first major international hit. It was released theatrically in the United States by RKO Radio Pictures on December 26, 1951, in both subtitled and dubbed versions. In Europe, the film sold 365,293 tickets in France and Spain, and 8,292 tickets in other European countries between 1996 and 2020, for a combined total of at least 373,585 tickets sold in Europe. By June 1952, the film had grossed $700,000 overseas. Later that same year, Scene reported that the film had earned $800,000 (\u00a5300 million) overseas, which was $200,000 more than what all of the previous Japanese movies released overseas had collectively grossed outside of Japan within the past four years. In 1954, Kinema Junpo stated that it grossed $500,000 in 1951, and reached roughly $800,000 shortly thereafter. According to the National Board of Review, Rashomon exceeded $300,000 in the United States alone.\nIn 2002, the film grossed $46,808 in the US, with an additional earned $96,568 during 2009 to 2010, for a combined $143,376 in the United States between 2002 and 2010.\n\nVenice Film Festival screening\nJapanese film companies had no interest in international festivals and were reluctant to submit the movie because paying for printing and creating subtitles was considered a waste of money. The film was subsequently screened at the 1951 Venice Film Festival at the behest of Italifilm president Giuliana Stramigioli, who had recommended it to the Italian film promotion agency Unitalia Film seeking a Japanese film to screen at the festival. In 1953, Stramigioli explained her reasoning behind submitting the film:\n\nI was shocked by Rashomon. Regardless of whether it would win an award, the first condition is that it would generate a great deal of buzz. In that sense, Rashomon is a very distinctive film, and because it is so Japanese, I thought it was entirely appropriate. I also thought that the way it handled the theme, the way it was portrayed, and the spirit and humanity that flowed through the film were all excellent.\nHowever, Daiei and other Japanese corporations disagreed with the choice of Kurosawa's work because it was \"not [representative enough] of the Japanese movie industry\" and felt that a work of Yasujir\u014d Ozu would have been more illustrative of excellence in Japanese cinema. Despite these reservations, the film was screened at the festival.\nBefore it was screened at the Venice festival, the film initially drew little attention and had low expectations at the festival, as Japanese cinema was not yet taken seriously in the West at the time. But once it had been screened, Rashomon drew an overwhelmingly positive response from festival audiences, praising its originality and techniques while making many question the nature of truth. The film won both the Italian Critics Award and the Golden Lion award\u2014introducing Western audiences, including Western directors, more noticeably to both Kurosawa's films and techniques, such as shooting directly into the sun and using mirrors to reflect sunlight onto the actor's faces.\n\nHome media\nKadokawa released Rashomon on DVD in May 2008 and Blu-ray in February 2009. The Criterion Collection later issued a Blu-ray and DVD edition of the film based on the 2008 restoration, accompanied by a number of additional features.\n\nReception\nCritical response\nJapanese reviews\nRashomon was met with mixed reviews from Japanese critics upon its release. When it received positive responses in the West, Japanese critics were baffled: some decided that it was only admired there because it was \"exotic\"; others thought that it succeeded because it was more \"Western\" than most Japanese films.\nTadashi Iijima criticized \"its insufficient plan for visualizing the style of the original stories\". Tatsuhiko Shigeno of Kinema Junpo opposed Mifune's extensive dialogue as unfitting for the role of a bandit. Akira Iwasaki later cited how he and his contemporaries were \"impressed by the boldness and excellence of director Akira Kurosawa's experimental approach within this movie, but couldn't help but notice that there was some confusion in its expression\" adding that \"I found it difficult to resonate with the agnostic philosophy that the film contains wholeheartedly\".\nIn a collection of interpretations of Rashomon, Donald Richie writes that \"the confines of 'Japanese' thought could not contain the director, who thereby joined the world at large\". Regarding the film's Japanese reception, Kurosawa remarked:\n\n\"Japanese are terribly critical of Japanese films, so it is not too surprising that a foreigner should have been responsible for my [film] being sent to Venice. It was the same way with Japanese woodcuts; it was the foreigners who first appreciated them. We Japanese think too little of our own things. Actually, Rashomon wasn't all that good, I don't think. Yet when people have said to me that its reception was just a stroke of luck, a fluke, I have answered by saying that they only say these things because the film is, after all, Japanese, and then I wonder: Why do we all think so little of our own things? Why don\u2019t we stand up for our films? What are we so afraid of?\"\n\nInternational reviews\nRashomon received mostly acclaim from Western critics.\nEd Sullivan gave the film a positive review in Hollywood Citizen-News, calling it \"an exciting evening, because the direction, the photography and the performances will jar open your eyes.\" He praised Akutagawa's original plot, Kurosawa's impactful direction and screenplay, Mifune's \"magnificent\" villainous performance, and Miyagawa's \"spellbinding\" cinematography that achieves \"visual dimensions that I've never seen in Hollywood photography\" such as being \"shot through a relentless rainstorm that heightens the mood of the somber drama.\" Meanwhile, Time was critical of the film, finding it \"draggy\" and noted that its score \"borrows freely\" from Maurice Ravel's Bol\u00e9ro.\n\nBol\u00e9ro controversy\nThe usage of a musical composition similar to Ravel's Bol\u00e9ro provoked wide controversy, especially in Western countries. Some accused Hayasaka of music plagiarism, including Bol\u00e9ro's publisher, who sent him a letter of protest after the film's French release.\nIn late 1950, the film was vetoed from Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan's selection list for the 4th Cannes Film Festival over concerns about facing copyright issues for the composition.\n\nMasaichi Nagata's response\nDaiei's president, Masaichi Nagata, was initially critical of the film. Assistant director Tokuz\u014d Tanaka said that Nagata broke the abrupt few minutes of silence following its preview screening at the company's headquarters in Ky\u014dbashi by saying \"I don't really get it, but it's a noble photograph\". According to Kurosawa, Nagata had called Rashomon \"incomprehensible\" and louthed it so much that he ended up demoting its producer.\nNagata later embraced Rashomon upon it receiving numerous awards and international success. He kept the original Golden Lion that the film received in his office, and had replicas handed to Kurosawa and others who worked on the film. His constant reference to its accomplishments as if he was responsible for the film himself was stated by many. In 1992, Kurosawa remarked that Nagata had cited Rashomon's cinematographic feats in an interview included for the film's first television broadcast without mentioning the names of its director or cinematographer. He reflected being disgusted by the company's president taking credit for the film's achievements: \"Watching that television interview, I had the feeling that I was back in the world of Rashomon all over again. It was as if the pathetic self-delusions of the ego, those failings I had attempted to portray in the film, were being exhibited in real life. People do indeed have immense difficulty talking about themselves as they really are. I was reminded once again that the human animal suffers from the trait of instinctive self-aggrandizement.\" Some modern sources have erroneously credited Nagata as the film's producer.\n\nAccolades\nLegacy\nAssociated films\nThe international success of Rashomon led Daiei to produce several subsequent jidaigeki films featuring Ky\u014d as the lead. Among these were K\u014dzabur\u014d Yoshimura's The Tale of Genji (1951), Teinosuke Kinugasa's Dedication of the Great Buddha (1952) and Gate of Hell (1953), Kenji Mizoguchi's Ugetsu (1953), and Keigo Kimura's The Princess Sen (1954), all of which received screenings overseas. In 1952, Daiei produced a Western-targeted epic, titled Beauty and the Thief, with the intent of obtaining a second Golden Lion. Based on another story by Akutagawa, composed by Hayasaka, and starring Ky\u014d, Mori, Shimura, Kat\u014d, and Honma, the film has been described as an inferior imitator of Rashomon and has since faded into obscurity. Mifune was also initially going to appear in Beauty and the Thief as suggested by a photograph of him taken by Werner Bischof during production in 1951 when the film was allegedly titled \"Hokkaido\".\n\nCultural impact\nRashomon has been cited as \"one of the most influential films of the 20th century\". In the early 1960s, film historians credited Rashomon as the start of the international New Wave cinema movement, which gained popularity during the late 1950s to early 1960s. It has since been cited as an inspiration for numerous films from around the world, including Andha Naal (1954), Valerie (1957), Last Year at Marienbad (1961), Yavanika (1982), Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992) and Pulp Fiction (1994), The Usual Suspects (1995), Courage Under Fire (1996), Tape (2001), Hero (2002), and Fast X (2023).\nThe television shows All in the Family (1971\u20131979), Frasier (1993\u20132004), and The Acolyte (2024) were also inspired by the film. Some have compared Monster (2023) to the film, however, director Hirokazu Kore-eda claimed its similarities are merely coincidental. Ryan Reynolds' initial proposal for Deadpool & Wolverine (2024) was for it to have a plot similar to Rashomon.\n\nIn a 1998 issue of Time Out New York, Andrew Johnston wrote: Rashomon is probably familiar even to those who haven't seen it, since in movie jargon, the film's title has become synonymous with its chief narrative conceit: a story told multiple times from various points of view. There's much more than that to the film, of course. For example, the way Kurosawa uses his camera...takes this fascinating meditation on human nature closer to the style of silent film than almost anything made after the introduction of sound.\n\nRemakes and adaptations\nIt spawned numerous remakes and adaptations across film, television and theatre. Examples include:\n\nRashomon as a play, various versions of which have been performed since the 1950s, including on Broadway in 1959 as written by Michael and Fay Kanin.\nOn The Play of the Week, in 1960, season 2, episode 12, \"Rashomon\".

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 98% of 63 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 9.2\/10. The website's consensus reads: \"One of legendary director Akira Kurosawa's most acclaimed films, Rashomon features an innovative narrative structure, brilliant acting, and a thoughtful exploration of reality versus perception.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 98 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\nFilm critic Roger Ebert gave the film four stars out of four and included it in his Great Movies list.\n\nTop lists\nThe film appeared on many critics' top lists of the best films.\n\n10th \u2013 Directors' Top Ten Poll in 1992, Sight & Sound\n10th - 100 Greatest Films list in 2000 The Village Voice\n76th - \"Top 100 Essential Films of All Time\" by the National Society of Film Critics in 2002.\n9th \u2013 Directors' Top Ten Poll in 2002, Sight & Sound\n13th - Critics' poll in 2002, Sight & Sound\n290th \u2013 The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time in 2008, Empire\n50 Klassiker, Film by Nicolaus Schr\u00f6der in 2002\n1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die by Steven Jay Schneider in 2003\n7th \u2013 Kinema Junpo's The Greatest Japanese Films of All Time in 2009.\n22nd \u2013 Empire's \"The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema\" in 2010.\n26th - Critics top ten poll, 100 Greatest Films of All Time, Sight & Sound (2012)\n18th - Director's top ten poll, 100 Greatest Films of All Time, Sight & Sound (2012)\nWoody Allen included it among his top ten films.\n4th - BBC's list of \"100 greatest foreign language films\" in 2018.\n\nPreservation\nIn 2008, the film was restored by the Academy Film Archive, the National Film Center of the National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo, and Kadokawa Pictures, Inc., with funding provided by the Kadokawa Culture Promotion Foundation and The Film Foundation.\n\nSee also\nKish\u014dtenketsu\nList of films considered the best\nNonlinear narrative\nUnreliable narrator\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nDavis, Blair; Anderson, Robert; Walls, Jan (November 2015).

Based on Sh\u016bgor\u014d Yamamoto's 1959 short story collection, Akahige Shinry\u014dtan, the film takes place in Koishikawa, a district of Edo, towards the end of the Tokugawa period, and is about the relationship between a town doctor and his new trainee. Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel Humiliated and Insulted provided the source for a subplot about a young girl, Otoyo (Terumi Niki), who is rescued from a brothel.\nThe film looks at the problem of social injustice and explores two of Kurosawa's favorite topics: humanism and existentialism. A few critics have noted the film to be reminiscent in some ways of Ikiru. It is Kurosawa's last black-and-white film. The film was a major box office success in Japan but is known for having caused a rift between Mifune and Kurosawa, with this being the final collaboration between them after working on 16 films together. The film was screened in competition at the 26th Venice International Film Festival. Toshiro Mifune won a Volpi Cup for Best Actor for his performance in the film. It was also nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nPlot\nThe young and arrogant doctor Noboru Yasumoto, trained in a Dutch medical school in Nagasaki, aspires to the status of personal physician of the Shogunate, a position currently held by a close relative, and expects to progress through the privileged and insulated army structure of medical education. However, for Yasumoto's post-graduate medical training, he is assigned to a rural clinic under the guidance of Dr. Kyoj\u014d Niide, known as Akahige (\"Red Beard\"). Beneath a gruff exterior, Dr. Niide is a compassionate and wise clinic director.\nYasumoto is initially livid at his posting, believing that he has little to gain from working under Dr. Niide. He assumes that Niide is only interested in seeing Yasumoto's medical notes from Nagasaki, and he rebels against the clinic director. He refuses to see patients or to wear his uniform, disdains the food and spartan environment, and enters a forbidden garden where he meets \"The Mantis,\" a mysterious patient that only Dr. Niide can treat. Meanwhile, we learn that\nYasumoto's former fianc\u00e9e, Chigusa, was unfaithful to him, ending their engagement, and generating a disdain in him for romantic relationships.\nAs Yasumoto struggles to come to terms with his situation, the film tells the story of a few of the clinic's patients. One of them is Rokusuke, a dying man whom Dr. Niide discerns is troubled by a secret misery that is only revealed when his desperately unhappy daughter shows up. Another is Sahachi, a well-loved man of the town known for his generosity to his neighbours, who has a tragic connection to his wife's corpse which is discovered after a landslide. After committing bigamy, she had him unknowingly kill her by asking that he \"Hold me closer\" when they were hugging while she surreptitiously held a knife to herself. Dr. Niide brings Yasumoto along to rescue a sick twelve-year-old girl, Otoyo, from a brothel (brutally fighting off a local gang of thugs to do so) and then assigns the girl to Yasumoto as his first patient. Through these experiences, Yasumoto begins to humble himself and open his eyes to the world around him.\nWhen Yasumoto himself falls ill, Dr. Niide asks Otoyo to nurse him back to health, knowing that caring for Yasumoto will also be part of her own continued healing. Chigusa's younger sister, Masae, visits the clinic to check in on Yasumoto, telling him that his mother wants him to visit. Through his mother, Yasumoto learns that Chigusa now has a child with her new lover. Masae later makes a kimono for Otoyo, showing compassion that suggests she might be a good match for Yasumoto. Yasumoto's mother likes Masae and suggests marriage.\nYasumoto begins to understand the magnitude of cruelty and suffering around him, as well as his power to ease that suffering, and learns to regret his vanity and selfishness.\nLater, when a local boy, Ch\u00f4bu, is caught stealing food from the clinic, Otoyo shows him compassion and befriends him, passing on the compassion she received from Niide and Yasumoto. When the brothel's madam comes to the clinic to claim Otoyo and take her back to the brothel, the doctors and clinic staff refuse to let Otoyo go, and chase the madam away. When Ch\u00f4bu and his destitute family try to escape their misery by taking poison together, the clinic doctors work to save them.\nYasumoto is offered the position of personal physician to the Shogunate he had so coveted. He agrees to marry Masae, but at the wedding announces that he will not accept the new position, but will stay at the clinic, turning down a comfortable and prestigious place in society to continue serving the poor alongside Dr. Niide.\n\nCast\nToshiro Mifune as Dr. Kyoj\u014d Niide also known as \"Red Beard\", a rough-tempered yet charitable town doctor and martial artist.\nY\u016bz\u014d Kayama as Dr. Noboru Yasumoto\nTsutomu Yamazaki as Sahachi\nReiko Dan as Osugi, a servant.\nMiyuki Kuwano as Onaka\nKy\u014dko Kagawa as \"The Mantis\", a madwoman.\nTatsuyoshi Ehara as Genzo Tsugawa\nTerumi Niki as Otoyo\nAkemi Negishi as Okuni\nYoshitaka Zushi as Chobu\nYoshio Tsuchiya as Dr. Handayu Mori\nEijir\u014d T\u014dno as Goheiji\nTakashi Shimura as Tokubei Izumiya\nChish\u016b Ry\u016b as Noboru's father\nKinuyo Tanaka as Noboru's mother\nK\u014dji Mitsui as Heikichi\nHaruko Sugimura as Kin, the madam of a local brothel.\nCast taken from The Criterion Collection.\n\nProduction\nWriting\nAfter finishing High and Low (1963), director Akira Kurosawa accidentally picked up Sh\u016bgor\u014d Yamamoto's 1959 novel Akahige Shinry\u014dtan. Although he initially believed it would make a good script for fellow director Hiromichi Horikawa, Kurosawa became so interested in it as he wrote, that he knew he would have to direct it himself. Kurosawa completed writing the script for the film in early July 1963, which he co-wrote with screenwriters Masato Ide, Hideo Oguni, and Ry\u016bz\u014d Kikushima. Kurosawa noted that the script was quite different from the book, specifically mentioning how the young girl main character was not in Yamamoto's novel. With this character, Kurosawa tried to show what Fyodor Dostoevsky showed using the character Nellie in Humiliated and Insulted.\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began on December 21, 1963, and wrapped up two years later. Kurosawa got sick twice during filming, while actors Toshiro Mifune and Y\u016bz\u014d Kayama fell ill once each. Mifune would never again work with Kurosawa because the director's increasingly long production schedules required Mifune to turn down too many other TV and movie offers. The set was intended to be as realistic and historically accurate as possible. Film historian Donald Richie wrote that the main set was an entire town with back alleys and side streets, some of which were never even filmed. The materials used were actually about as old as they were supposed to be, with the tiled roofs taken from buildings more than a century old and all of the lumber taken from the oldest available farmhouses. Costumes and props were \"aged\" for months before being used; the bedding (made in Tokugawa-period patterns) was actually slept in for up to half a year before shooting. The wood used for the main gate was over a hundred years old, and after filming, it was re-erected at the entrance to the theater that hosted Red Beard's premiere.\nRichie wrote that one could argue that Kurosawa \"completely wasted his million yen set,\" as the main street is seen for only one minute (although its destruction was incorporated into the earthquake scene). Likewise, the scenes with the bridges and those in the elaborately constructed paddy are also rather brief. However, tourist bus companies did run tours through the set during the two years it took to make Red Beard.\nAccording to Stephen Prince's audio commentary on the Criterion Collection's 2002 DVD, the film was shot at an aspect ratio of 2.35:1, and was Kurosawa's first film to use a magnetic 4-track stereo soundtrack.\n\nRelease\nToho was originally slated to release Red Beard during the New Year's holiday season, but it was delayed, forcing producer Tomoyuki Tanaka to produce Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster, instead. The film was eventually given a roadshow theatrical release in Japan by Toho on April 3, 1965, and was released throughout Japan on April 24, 1965. The film earned \u00a5400 million, with \u00a5361.59 million in distributor rental earnings, making it was one of the highest-grossing Japanese films of 1965. Toho International released the film to theaters in the United States with English subtitles in January 1966, and it was reissued by Frank Lee International in December 1968. In 1978, the film received a theatrical release in France, and sold 200,402 tickets during its theatrical run. The film was screened at the 72nd Venice International Film Festival in 2015.\nIn 1992, the film was released in the United States on LaserDisc by The Criterion Collection, and on VHS by Media Home Entertainment. The Criterion Collection released the film on DVD in the United States on July 16, 2002. Toho released the film on DVD in Japan on November 21, 2002 and reissued it on February 18, 2015. In 2003, BFI released 'Red Beard' on a Region 2 DVD, with English subtitles. Their copy comes in a box with extensive sleeve notes. In 2014, Madman Entertainment distributed the film on DVD in Region 4.\n\nReception\nCritical reception\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 75% of 16 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.50\/10. The film has a score of 4.2\/5 on Eiga.com, based on 41 reviews, with 56% of reviewers giving it a 5\/5.\nThe film opened to highly positive reviews in Japan, with many calling it Kurosawa's magnum opus, and winning the Best Film award by the Japanese film magazine Kinema Junpo. However, the film received a mixed response from Western audiences; while it was a box-office success in Japan, it failed commercially abroad.\nRoger Ebert gave the film four stars in a review dated December 26, 1969, writing \"Akira Kurosawa's Red Beard is assembled with the complexity and depth of a good 19th\u2013century novel, and it's a pleasure, in a time of stylishly fragmented films, to watch a director taking the time to fully develop his characters.\" Michael Sragow of The New Yorker wrote \"This 1965 film, the last of Akira Kurosawa's collaboration with Toshiro Mifune, is often derided as a soap opera. But the story of a grizzled nineteenth-century doctor nicknamed Red Beard (Mifune) and his green physician (Yuzo Kayama) who learns human medical values from him \u2014 is actually a masterpiece.\"\nIn his 2015 Movie Guide, Leonard Maltin gave the film two and a half stars, calling it an \"unoriginal drama is also way overlong  [sic].\" The Finnish director Aki Kaurism\u00e4ki cited it as his third favorite film, alongside Ikiru, another Kurosawa picture.\n\nAccolades\nReferences\nSources\nExternal links\nRed Beard at IMDb\nRed Beard at AllMovie\nRed Beard at the TCM Movie Database\nRed Beard (in Japanese) at the Japanese Movie Database\nRed Beard at Rotten Tomatoes","153":"A number of Akira Kurosawa's films have been remade.\nNote: This list includes full remakes only; it does not include films whose narratives have been loosely inspired by the basic plot of one or more of the director's films \u2013 as A Bug's Life (1998) references both Seven Samurai (1954) and its Hollywood remake The Magnificent Seven (1960) \u2013 nor movies that adopt, adapt, or parody individual plot elements or characters from a Kurosawa film without adapting the entire film, as Star Wars (1977) did with The Hidden Fortress (1958).\nThe 1999 movie Inferno (Desert Heat) with Jean Claude Van Damme is also a remake of Yojimbo.

A few years into the marriage, her husband treats her carelessly, and she is slowly worn down by domestic drudgery.

According to screenwriter Toshir\u014d Ide, he and his co-writer Sumie Tanaka had wanted to finish the story with the couple's divorce, but this was vetoed by the studio in favour of a conclusion with, as contemporary critic Takao Toda put it, \"mass appeal\".

The story centers on an elderly hibakusha, who lost her husband in the 1945 atomic bombing of Nagasaki, caring for her four grandchildren over the summer. She learns of a long-lost brother, Suzujiro, living in Hawaii who wants her to visit him before he dies. American film star Richard Gere appears as Suzujiro's son Clark. The film was selected as the Japanese entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 64th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.\nRhapsody in August is one of only three sole-directed Kurosawa movies to feature a female lead, and the first in nearly half a century. The others are The Most Beautiful (1944) and No Regrets for Our Youth (1946). However, Kurosawa also directed most of the female-led Uma (1941), on which he was credited as assistant director.\n\nPlot\nRhapsody in August is a tale of three generations in a post-war Japanese family and their responses to the atomic bombing of Japan. Kane is an elderly woman, now suffering the consequences of older age and diminishing memory, whose husband was killed in the atomic bombing of Nagasaki. Kane has two children who are both married and both of whom grew up in postwar Japan. She also has a brother now living in Hawaii whose son Clark (played by Richard Gere) has grown up in America. Finally, there are Kane's four grandchildren, who were born after the Japanese economic miracle who have come to visit her at the family country home near Nagasaki in Kyushu.\nKane's grandchildren are visiting her at her rural home on Ky\u016bsh\u016b one summer while their parents visit Kane's brother in Hawaii. The grandchildren have been charged with the task by their parents of convincing their grandmother to visit her brother in Hawaii. The grandchildren take a day off to visit the urban environment of Nagasaki. While in Nagasaki the children visit the spot where their grandfather was killed in 1945 and become aware, at a personal level, of some of the emotional consequences of the atomic bombing for the first time in their lives. They slowly come to have more respect for their grandmother and also grow to question the morality of the United States for deciding to use atomic weapons against Japan.\nIn the meantime they receive a telegram from their American cousins, who turn out to be rich and offer their parents a job managing their pineapple fields in Hawaii. Matters are complicated when Kane writes to Hawaii telling her American relatives about the death of her husband at Nagasaki. Her own two children, who have now returned from Hawaii to visit her, feel that this action will be viewed by their now Americanized relatives in Hawaii as hostile and a source of friction. Clark, who is Kane's nephew, then travels to Japan to be with Kane for the memorial service of her husband's death at Nagasaki. Kane reconciles with Clark over the bombing.\nClark is much moved by the events he sees in the Nagasaki community at the time of the memorial events surrounding the deaths which are annually remembered following the bombing of Nagasaki. Especially significant to Clark is the viewing of a Buddhist ceremony where the local community of Nagasaki meets to remember those who had died when the bomb was dropped. Suddenly, Clark receives a telegram telling him that his father, Kane's brother, has died in Hawaii and he is forced to return there for his father's funeral.\nKane's mental health and memory begin to falter. Her recollections of her lost spouse have never been fully reconciled within her own memory of her lost loved one. She begins to show signs of odd behavior in laying out her husband's old clothing as if her husband might suddenly reappear and need them to put on. When a storm is brewing, her mental health seems to confuse the storm for an air raid warning of another atomic bomb attack and she seeks to protect her visiting grandchildren by employing folk remedies, which confuse her children and especially her grandchildren. As the storm later intensifies again, Kane becomes more disoriented and mistakenly confuses the storm for the atmospheric disturbance caused by the bombing of Nagasaki which she witnessed visually from a safe distance when her husband was killed many years ago. In her disoriented state, Kane decides that she must save her husband, still alive in her memory, from the impending atomic blast. With all her remaining strength, she takes her small umbrella to battle the storm on foot on the way to warn her husband in Nagasaki of the mortal threat still fresh in her mind of the atomic blast which she cannot forget.\n\nCast\nSachiko Murase as Kane (The Grandmother)\nHisashi Igawa as Tadao (Kane's Son)\nNarumi Kayashima as Machiko (Tadao's Wife)\nTomoko Otakara as Tami (Tadao's Daughter)\nMitsunori Isaki as Shinjiro (Tadao's Son)\nToshie Negishi as Yoshie (Kane's Daughter)\nHidetaka Yoshioka as Tateo (Yoshie's Son)\nChoichiro Kawarazaki as Noboru (Yoshie's Husband)\nMieko Suzuki as Minako (Yoshie's Daughter)\nRichard Gere as Clark (Kane's Nephew)\n\nProduction\nKurosawa told Gabriel Garcia Marquez in 1990:I have not filmed shockingly realistic scenes which would prove to be unbearable and yet would not explain in and of themselves the horror of the drama. What I would like to convey is the type of wounds the atomic bomb left in the heart of our people, and how they gradually began to heal.The film marked Sachiko Murase's last feature appearance. The role of Clark was originally offered to Gene Hackman, who declined for health reasons. Richard Gere volunteered for the role after reading the screenplay, but Kurosawa was initially reluctant to cast Gere due to his age and image. \nOther than Murase and Gere, most of the cast were child actors. Two of the child actors had previously appeared in Dreams.\n\nReception\nRhapsody in August received mixed reviews on its release in 1991. Roger Ebert wrote that the film was viewed as a disappointment at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival, was \"not one of [Kurosawa's] great films,\" and was part of a shift in Kurosawa's style toward more fanciful imagery.\nSome critics made much of the fact that the film centered on the film's depiction of the atomic bombing as a war crime while omitting details of Japanese war crimes in the Pacific War.  When Rhapsody premiered at Cannes, one journalist even cried out at a press conference, \"Why was the bomb dropped in the first place?\" Others at Cannes, especially Americans, were outraged at the lack of mention of Japanese atrocities during the war. Kevin Thomas and Desson Howe specifically criticized Kurosawa's failure to mention Pearl Harbor despite the American relatives in the family being from Hawaii.\nAt the Tokyo Film Festival, critics of Japanese militarism said Kurosawa had ignored the historical facts leading up to the bomb. Japanese cultural critic Inuhiko Yomota commented: \"Many critics, myself included, thought Kurosawa chauvinistic in his portrayal of the Japanese as victims of the war, while ignoring the brutal actions of the Japanese and whitewashing them with cheap humanist sentiment.\" Kurosawa's response was that wars are between governments, not people, and denied any anti-American agenda.\nVincent Canby of The New York Times argued that the film's message was targeted toward a Japanese audience rather than a Western audience, describing Kurosawa's message as being: \"if Japanese, those of the children's parents' generation, are so convinced that Americans are unforgiving, it also means that the same Japanese are equally implacable.\"\nChicago Reader film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum praised the film as \"a beautiful reminder from octogenarian Akira Kurosawa that he's still the master...The pastoral mood and performances of this film are both reminiscent of late John Ford, and Kurosawa's mise en scene and editing have seldom been more poetically apt.\"\nThe significance of Clark's apology to Kane is controversial. It can be narrowly interpreted as an apology for being inconsiderate of Kane's feelings when urging her to visit her brother in Hawaii, but can also be more broadly interpreted as an apology for the death of Kane's husband, and by extension, an apology for the bomb on behalf of Americans.\n\nLegacy\nIn 1990, shortly before the film's release, St. Paul, Minnesota mayor James Schiebel visited Nagasaki and learned that there was no sculpture in the Peace Park from the United States, a point mentioned in the film. Rhapsody in August was screened in St. Paul in 1991 as part of the efforts to raise funds for the Constellation Earth sculpture, which was donated to the Peace Park and formally unveiled in September 1992.\nRichard Gere purchased the Buddhist temple constructed for the film and had it re-built at his vacation home in the United States.\n\nSee also\nAtomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki\nHibakusha\nJapanese-American\nList of submissions to the 64th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film\nList of Japanese submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\nRhapsody in August at IMDb\nRhapsody in August at Rotten Tomatoes\nRhapsody in August at Box Office Mojo\nRhapsody in August (in Japanese) at the Japanese Movie Database","156":"Richard Price (born October 12, 1949) is an American novelist and screenwriter, known for the books The Wanderers (1974), Clockers (1992) and Lush Life (2008).

The company was launched in August 1998 by three undergraduate students at the University of California, Berkeley: Senh Duong, Patrick Y. Lee, and Stephen Wang. Although the name \"Rotten Tomatoes\" connects to the practice of audiences throwing rotten tomatoes in disapproval of a poor stage performance, the direct inspiration for the name from Duong, Lee, and Wang came from an equivalent scene in the 1992 Canadian film L\u00e9olo.\nSince January 2010, Rotten Tomatoes has been owned by Flixster, which was in turn acquired by Warner Bros. in 2011. In February 2016, Rotten Tomatoes and its parent site Flixster were sold to Comcast's Fandango ticketing company. Warner Bros. retained a minority stake in the merged entities, including Fandango.\nThe site is influential among moviegoers, a third of whom say they consult it before going to the cinema in the U.S. It has been criticized for oversimplifying reviews by flattening them into a fresh vs. rotten dichotomy. It has also been criticized for being easy for studios to manipulate by limiting early screenings to critics inclined to be favorable, among other tactics.\n\nHistory\nRotten Tomatoes was launched on August 12, 1998, as a spare-time project by Senh Duong. His objective in creating Rotten Tomatoes was \"to create a site where people can get access to reviews from a variety of critics in the U.S\". As a fan of Jackie Chan, Duong was inspired to create the website after collecting all the reviews of Chan's Hong Kong action movies as they were being released in the United States. The catalyst for the creation of the website was Rush Hour (1998), Chan's first major Hollywood crossover, which was originally planned to release in August 1998. Duong coded the website in two weeks and the site went live the same month, but the release of Rush Hour was delayed until September 1998. Besides Jackie Chan films, he began including other films on Rotten Tomatoes, extending it beyond Chan's fandom. The first non-Chan Hollywood movie whose reviews were featured on Rotten Tomatoes was Your Friends & Neighbors (1998). The website was an immediate success, receiving mentions by Netscape, Yahoo!, and USA Today within the first week of its launch; it attracted \"600\u20131,000 daily unique visitors\" as a result.\nDuong teamed up with University of California, Berkeley classmates Patrick Y. Lee and Stephen Wang, his former partners at the Berkeley, California-based web design firm Design Reactor, to pursue Rotten Tomatoes on a full-time basis. They officially launched it on April 1, 2000.\nIn June 2004, IGN Entertainment acquired Rotten Tomatoes for an undisclosed sum. In September 2005, IGN was bought by News Corp's Fox Interactive Media. In January 2010, IGN sold the website to Flixster. The combined reach of both companies is 30 million unique visitors a month across all different platforms, according to the companies. In 2011, Warner Bros. acquired Rotten Tomatoes.\nIn early 2009, Current Television launched The Rotten Tomatoes Show, a televised version of the web review site. It was hosted by Brett Erlich and Ellen Fox and written by Mark Ganek. The show aired Thursdays at 10:30 EST until September 16, 2010. It returned as a much shorter segment of InfoMania, a satirical news show that ended in 2011.\nBy late 2009, the website was designed to enable Rotten Tomatoes users to create and join groups to discuss various aspects of film. One group, \"The Golden Oyster Awards\", accepted votes of members for various awards, spoofing the better-known Academy Awards or Golden Globes. When Flixster bought the company, they disbanded the groups.\nAs of February 2011, new community features have been added and others removed. For example, users can no longer sort films by Fresh Ratings from Rotten Ratings, and vice versa.\nOn September 17, 2013, a section devoted to scripted television series, called TV Zone, was created as a subsection of the website.\nIn February 2016, Rotten Tomatoes and its parent site Flixster were sold to Comcast's Fandango Media. Warner Bros retained a minority stake in the merged entities, including Fandango.\nIn December 2016, Fandango and all its various websites moved to Fox Interactive Media's former headquarters in Beverly Hills, California.\nIn July 2017, the website's editor-in-chief since 2007, Matt Atchity, left to join The Young Turks YouTube channel.  On November 1, 2017, the site launched a new web series on Facebook, See It\/Skip It, hosted by Jacqueline Coley and Segun Oduolowu.\nIn March 2018, the site announced its new design, icons and logo for the first time in 19 years at South by Southwest.\nOn May 19, 2020, Rotten Tomatoes won the 2020 Webby People's Voice Award for Entertainment in the Web category.\nIn February 2021, the Rotten Tomatoes staff made an entry on their Product Blog, announcing several design changes to the site:  Each film's 'Score Box' at the top of the page would now also include its release year, genre, and runtimes, with an MPAA rating to be soon added; the number of ratings would be shown in groupings \u2013 from 50+ up to 250,000+ ratings, for easier visualization.  Links to critics and viewers are included underneath the ratings.  By clicking on either the Tomatometer Score or the Audience Score, the users can access \"Score Details\" information, such as the number of Fresh and Rotten reviews, average rating, and Top Critics' score. The team also added a new \"What to Know\" section for each film entry page, which could combine the \"Critics Consensus\" blurb with a new \"Audience Says\" blurb, so users can see an at-a-glance summary of the sentiments of both certified critics and verified audience members.\n\nFeatures\nCritics' aggregate score\nRotten Tomatoes staff first collect online reviews from writers who are certified members of various writing guilds or film critic-associations. To be accepted as a critic on the website, a critic's original reviews must garner a specific number of \"likes\" from users. Those classified as \"Top Critics\" generally write for major newspapers. The critics upload their reviews to the movie page on the website, and need to mark their review \"fresh\" if it is generally favorable or \"rotten\" otherwise. It is necessary for the critic to do so as some reviews are qualitative and do not grant a numeric score, making it impossible for the system to be automatic.\nThe website keeps track of all the reviews counted for each film and calculates the percentage of positive reviews. If the positive reviews make up 60% or more, the film is considered \"fresh\". If the positive reviews are less than 60%, the film is considered \"rotten\". An average score on a 0 to 10 scale is also calculated. With each review, a short excerpt of the review is quoted that also serves a hyperlink to the complete review essay for anyone interested to read the critic's full thoughts on the subject.\n\"Top Critics\", such as Roger Ebert, Desson Thomson, Stephen Hunter, Owen Gleiberman, Lisa Schwarzbaum, Peter Travers and Michael Phillips are identified in a sub-listing that calculates their reviews separately. Their opinions are also included in the general rating. When there are sufficient reviews, the staff creates and posts a consensus statement to express the general reasons for the collective opinion of the film.\nThis rating is indicated by an equivalent icon at the film listing, to give the reader a one-glance look at the general critical opinion about the work. The \"Certified Fresh\" seal is reserved for movies that satisfy two criteria: a \"Tomatometer\" of 75% or better and at least 80 reviews (40 for limited release movies) from \"Tomatometer\" critics (including 5 Top Critics). Films earning this status will keep it unless the positive critical percentage drops below 70%. Films with 100% positive ratings that lack the required number of reviews may not receive the \"Certified Fresh\" seal.\n\nWhen a film or TV show reaches the requirements for the \"Certified Fresh\", it is not automatically granted the seal; \"the Tomatometer score must be consistent and unlikely to deviate significantly\" before it is thus marked. Once certified, if a film's score drops and remains consistently below 70%, it loses its Certified Fresh designation.\n\nGolden Tomato Awards\nIn 2000, Rotten Tomatoes announced the RT Awards honoring the best-reviewed films of the year according to the website's rating system. The awards were later renamed the Golden Tomato Awards. The nominees and winners are announced on the website, although there is no actual awards ceremony.\nThe films are divided into wide release and limited release categories. Limited releases are defined as opening in 599 or fewer theaters at initial release. Platform releases, movies initially released under 600 theaters but later receiving wider distribution, fall under this definition. Any film opening in more than 600 theaters is considered wide release. There are also two categories purely for British and Australian films. The \"User\"-category represents the highest rated film among users, and the \"Mouldy\"-award represents the worst-reviewed films of the year. A movie must have 40 (originally 20) or more rated reviews to be considered for domestic categories. It must have 500 or more user ratings to be considered for the \"User\"-category.\nFilms are further classified based on film genre. Each movie is eligible in only one genre, aside from non-English-language films, which can be included in both their genre and the respective \"Foreign\" category.\nOnce a film is considered eligible, its \"votes\" are counted. Each critic from the website's list gets one vote (as determined by their review), all weighted equally. Because reviews are continually added, manually and otherwise, a cutoff date at which new reviews are not counted toward the Golden Tomato awards is initiated each year, usually the first of the new year. Reviews without ratings are not counted toward the results of the Golden Tomato Awards.\n\nAudience score and reviews\nEach movie features a \"user average\", which calculates the percentage of registered users who have rated the film positively on a 5-star scale, similar to calculation of recognized critics' reviews.\nOn May 24, 2019, Rotten Tomatoes introduced a verified rating system that would replace the earlier system where users were merely required to register to submit a rating. So, in addition to creating an account, users will have to verify their ticket purchase through ticketing company Fandango Media, parent company of Rotten Tomatoes. While users can still leave reviews without verifying, those reviews will not account for the average audience score displayed next to the Tomatometer.\nOn August 21, 2024, Rotten Tomatoes rebranded its audience score as the Popcornmeter and introduced a new \"Verified Hot\" badge. The designation is only given to films which have reached an audience score of 90 percent or higher among users whom Rotten Tomatoes has verified as having purchased a ticket to the film through Fandango. A representative for Rotten Tomatoes stated that their goal is to include other services in the future for users who do not use Fandango. Upon its creation, the \"Verified Hot\" badge was installed retroactively on over 200 films which achieved a verified audience score of 90% or higher since the launch of Rotten Tomatoes' verified audience ratings in May 2019.\n\n\"What to Know\"\nIn February 2021, a new \"What to Know\" section was created for each film entry, combining the \"Critics Consensus\" and a new \"Audience Says\" blurbs within it, to give users an at-a-glance summary of the general sentiments of a film as experienced by critics and audiences.  Prior to February 2021, only the \"Critics Consensus\" blurb was posted for each entry, after enough certified critics had submitted reviews. When the \"Audience Says\" blurbs were added, Rotten Tomatoes initially included them only for newer films and those with a significant audience rating, but suggested that they may later add them for older films as well.\n\n\"Critics Consensus\" \/ \"Audience Says\"\nEach movie features a brief blurb summary of the critics' reviews, called the \"Critical Consensus\", used in that entry's Tomatometer aggregate score. These are written by Jeff Giles, a longtime author for the site.\nIn February 2021, Rotten Tomatoes added an \"Audience Says\" section; similar to the \"Critics Consensus\", it summarizes the reviews noted by registered users into a concise blurb. The Rotten Tomatoes staff noted that for any given film, if there were any external factors such as controversies or issues affecting the sentiments of a film, they may address it in the \"Audience Says\" section to give users the most relevant info regarding their viewing choices.\n\nLocalized versions\nLocalized versions of the site available in the United Kingdom, India, and Australia were discontinued following the acquisition of Rotten Tomatoes by Fandango. The Mexican version of the site, Tomatazos, remains active.\n\nAPI\nThe Rotten Tomatoes API provides limited access to critic and audience ratings and reviews, allowing developers to incorporate Rotten Tomatoes data on other websites. The free service is intended for use in the US only; permission is required for use elsewhere. As of 2022, API access is restricted to approved developers that must go through an application process.\n\nInfluence\nMajor Hollywood studios have come to see Rotten Tomatoes as a potential threat to their marketing. In 2017, several blockbuster films like Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, Baywatch and The Mummy were projected to open with gross receipts of $90 million, $50 million and $45 million, respectively, but ended up debuting with $62.6 million, $23.1 million and $31.6 million. Rotten Tomatoes, which scored the films at 30%, 19% and 16%, respectively, was blamed for undermining them. That same summer, films like Wonder Woman and Spider-Man: Homecoming (both 92%) received high scores and opened at or exceeded expectations with their $100+ million trackings.\nAs a result of this concern, 20th Century Fox commissioned a 2015 study, titled \"Rotten Tomatoes and Box Office\", that stated the website combined with social media was going to be an increasingly serious complication for the film business: \"The power of Rotten Tomatoes and fast-breaking word of mouth will only get stronger. Many Millennials and even Gen X-ers now vet every purchase through the Internet, whether it's restaurants, video games, make-up, consumer electronics or movies. As they get older and comprise an even larger share of total moviegoers, this behavior is unlikely to change\". Other studios have commissioned a number of studies on the subject, with them finding that 7\/10 people said they would be less interested in seeing a film if the Rotten Tomatoes score was below 25%, and that the site has the most influence on people 25 and younger.\nThe scores have reached a level of online ubiquity which film companies have found threatening.  For instance, the scores are regularly posted in Google search results for films so reviewed. Furthermore, the scores are prominently featured in Fandango's popular ticket purchasing website, on its mobile app, on popular streaming services like Peacock, and on Flixster, which led to complaints that \"rotten\" scores damaged films' performances.\nOthers have argued that filmmakers and studios have only themselves to blame if Rotten Tomatoes produces a bad score, as this only reflects a poor reception among film critics. As one independent film distributor marketing executive noted, \"To me, it's a ridiculous argument that Rotten Tomatoes is the problem ... make a good movie!\". ComScore's Paul Dergarabedian had similar comments, saying: \"The best way for studios to combat the 'Rotten Tomatoes Effect' is to make better movies, plain and simple\".\nSome studios have suggested embargoing or cancelling early critic screenings in a response to poor reviews prior to a film's release affecting pre-sales and opening weekend numbers. In July 2017, Sony embargoed critic reviews for The Emoji Movie until mid-day the Thursday before its release. The film ended up with a 9% rating (including 0% after the first 25 reviews), but still opened to $24 million, on par with projections. Josh Greenstein, Sony Pictures President of Worldwide Marketing and Distribution, said, \"The Emoji Movie was built for people under 18 ... so we wanted to give the movie its best chance. What other wide release with a score under 8 percent has opened north of $20 million? I don't think there is one\". Conversely, Warner Bros. also did not do critic pre-screenings for The House, which held a score of 16% until the day of its release, and opened to just $8.7 million; the lowest of star Will Ferrell's career.\nThat marketing tactic can backfire, and drew the vocal disgust of influential critics such as Roger Ebert, who was prone to derisively condemn such moves, with gestures such as \"The Wagging Finger of Shame\", on At the Movies. Furthermore, the very nature of withholding reviews can draw early conclusions from the public that the film is of poor quality because of that marketing tactic.\nOn February 26, 2019, in response to issues surrounding coordinated \"bombing\" of user reviews for several films, most notably Captain Marvel and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, prior to their release, the site announced that user reviews would no longer be accepted until a film is publicly released. The site also announced plans to introduce a system for \"verified\" reviews, and that the \"Want to See\" statistic would now be expressed as a number so that it would not be confused with the audience score.\nIn April 2023, The Snowman, a 2017 film starring Michael Fassbender, reached the No. 1 spot in America on Netflix's Current Top 10 Most Watched list, despite it holding a score on Rotten Tomatoes of 6%.\nDespite arguments on how Rotten Tomatoes scores impact the box office, academic researchers so far have not found evidence that Rotten Tomatoes ratings affect box office performance.\n\nCriticism\nOversimplification\nIn January 2010, on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the New York Film Critics Circle, its chairman Armond White cited Rotten Tomatoes in particular and film review aggregators in general as examples of how \"the Internet takes revenge on individual expression\". He said they work by \"dumping reviewers onto one website and assigning spurious percentage-enthusiasm points to the discrete reviews\". According to White, such websites \"offer consensus as a substitute for assessment\". Landon Palmer, a film and media historian and an assistant professor in the Department of Journalism and Creative Media director in the College of Communication and Information Sciences at the University of Alabama agreed with White, stating that \"[Rotten Tomatoes applies a] problematic algorithm to pretty much all avenues of modern media art and entertainment\".\nDirector and producer Brett Ratner has criticized the website for \"reducing hundreds of reviews culled from print and online sources into a popularized aggregate score\", while expressing respect for traditional film critics. Writer Max Landis, following his film Victor Frankenstein receiving an approval rating of 24% on the site, wrote that the site \"breaks down entire reviews into just the word 'yes' or 'no', making criticism binary in a destructive arbitrary way\".\n\nReview manipulation\nVulture ran an article in September 2023 that raised several criticisms, including the ease at which large companies are able to manipulate reviewer ratings. The article cited publicity company Bunker 15 as an example of how scores can be boosted by recruiting obscure, often self-published reviewers, using the example of 2018's Ophelia.\nRotten Tomatoes responded by delisting several Bunker 15 films, including Ophelia. It told Vulture in a statement, \"We take the integrity of our scores seriously and do not tolerate any attempts to manipulate them. We have a dedicated team who monitors our platforms regularly and thoroughly investigates and resolves any suspicious activity.\"\nWIRED published an article in February 2024 written by Christopher Null, a former film critic, that argued such methods are standard activities performed by all PR agencies. In particular, Null points out that sponsoring legitimate, honest reviews has a long history in other industries and is a \"common tactic employed by indie titles to get visibility.\"\n\nOther criticisms\nAmerican director Martin Scorsese wrote a column in The Hollywood Reporter criticizing both Rotten Tomatoes and CinemaScore for promoting the idea that films like Mother! had to be \"instantly liked\" to be successful. Scorsese, in a dedication for the Roger Ebert Center for Film Studies at the University of Illinois later continued his criticism, voicing that Rotten Tomatoes and other review services \"devalue cinema on streaming platforms to the level of content\".\nIn 2015, while promoting the film Suffragette (which has a 73% approval rating) actress Meryl Streep accused Rotten Tomatoes of disproportionately representing the opinions of male film critics, resulting in a skewed ratio that adversely affected the commercial performances of female-driven films. \"I submit to you that men and women are not the same, they like different things,\" she said. \"Sometimes they like the same thing, but sometimes their tastes diverge. If the Tomatometer is slighted so completely to one set of tastes that drives box office in the United States, absolutely\". Critics took issue with the sentiment that someone's gender or ethnic background would dictate their response to art.\nRotten Tomatoes deliberately withheld the critic score for Justice League based on early reviews until the premiere of its See It\/Skip It episode on the Thursday before its release. Some critics viewed the move as a ploy to promote the web series, but some argued that the move was a deliberate conflict of interest on account of Warner Bros.' ownership of the film and Rotten Tomatoes, and the tepid critical reception of the DC Extended Universe films at the time.\nThe New York Times aggregated statistics on the critical reception of audience scores versus critic scores, and noticed in almost every genre that \"The public rates a movie more positively than do the critics. The only exceptions are black comedies and documentaries. Critics systematically rate films in these genres more highly than do Rotten Tomatoes users\". Slate magazine collected data in a similar survey that revealed a noticeable favor for movies released before the 1990s, that \"may be explained by a bias toward reviewers reviewing, or Rotten Tomatoes scoring, only the best movies from bygone eras\".\n\nSee also\nMetacritic\nInternet Movie Database (IMDb)\nList of films with a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes\nList of films with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes\n\"Splatty Tomato\"\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nWilkinson, Alissa (August 13, 2018). \"CinemaScore, Rotten Tomatoes, and movie audience scores, explained\".

In Japanese popular culture, it is portrayed as a white-collar worker who shows unwavering loyalty and commitment to his employer.\n\"Salarymen\" are expected to work long hours, work overtime, drink, sing karaoke, visit hostess bars with his or her colleagues and bosses, and prioritize work over everything else in his or her life. \"Salarymen\" typically enter a company after graduating from college and stay with that corporation for the duration of their career.\nOther popular concepts surrounding salarymen include kar\u014dshi, or death from overwork. In conservative Japanese culture, becoming a salaryman is an average career choice for young men and women and those who do not take this career path are regarded as living with a stigma and less prestige. On the other hand, the word salaryman is sometimes used with derogatory connotation for his total dependence on his employer and lack of individuality.\n\nHistory\nThe word sarar\u012bman is often described as wasei-eigo, a Japanese formation from English loanwords, but it appears to instead be a straight borrowing from the English phrase \"salaried man\", which predates the Japanese term by nearly a century.  The Japanese term saw widespread use by 1930, even before government expansion and militarization drove the growth of white-collar employment. The term does not include all workers who receive a set salary, but only \"white-collar workers in the large bureaucracy of a business firm or government office.\" The term includes those who work for government (e.g., bureaucrats) and major companies (e.g., those listed in Nikkei 225). Workers in the mizu sh\u014dbai (nightlife) and entertainment industries (including actors and singers) are not included even though their income may be salary based. Similarly, doctors, engineers, lawyers, accountants, musicians, artists, politicians, freelancers and corporate executives are also excluded.\nA typical description of the salaryman is a male white-collar employee who typically earns his salary \"based on individual abilities rather than on seniority.\" Salarymen are known for working long hours, sometimes over eighty hours per week. Often, because of his busy work schedule, the salaryman does not have time to raise a family and his work becomes a lifelong commitment. Companies typically hire the salarymen straight out of high school, and they are expected to stay with the company until retirement, around the time they reach the age between 55 and 60. As a reward for the demonstration of their loyalty, companies rarely fire the salarymen unless it is under special \"dire\" circumstances. There is also a belief that the \"amount of time spent at the workplace correlates to the perceived efficiency of the employee.\" As a result of this intense work-driven lifestyle, salarymen may be more likely to suffer from mental or physical health problems, including heart failure or suicide.\n\nSocial image\nThe prevalence of salarymen in Japanese society has given birth to many depictions by both the Japanese and American media. Some films in Japan about salarymen include Mr. Salaryman, Japanese Salaryman NEO (based on the TV series), and a drama series entitled History of a Salaryman. There is a certain expectation among the middle and upper classes for Japanese people to become salarymen. For many young Japanese men and women, accepting anything less than becoming a salaryman and conforming to its ideal is considered a failure, not only of him or her, but of his parents.\nThe life of a salaryman revolves around work. The activities that he or she does outside of his or her working hours typically involve his or her coworkers, which lessens the distance between him or her and work. Due to this expectation, there have been a variety of derogatory names given to salarymen: \u793e\u755c (shachiku, literally \"corporate livestock\" in reference to wage slavery), \u4f1a\u793e\u306e\u72ac (kaisha no inu or \"company's dog\"), and \u4f01\u696d\u6226\u58eb (kigyou senshi or \"corporate soldier\"), to ridicule salarymen.\n\nEntertainment\nChanging social circumstances have greatly diversified the life of the salaryman outside of work. Though the importance of social drinking has not declined, its image has changed over time from mass partying during the economic bubble to conservative consumption at home after the collapse of the economy during the 1990s. Mahjong was an immensely popular game among the 1960s generation of salarymen, who brought the game into company circles directly from high school and college groups. The 1970s generation saw a gradual decrease in the number of avid mahjong players, and by the 1980s, it became common not to show any interest at it at all.\nGolf became widely popular during the economic bubble, when golf club passes became useful tools for currying favor with corporate executives. Many mid-level salarymen were pressured into taking up golf to participate in golfing events with their superiors. The collapse of the economic bubble led to the closing of many golf courses, and playing golf with executives has become increasingly rare. However, some current salarymen may have golfing experience from their student days, and golf is still acknowledged as an expensive hobby for salarymen.\n\nKar\u014dshi\nExtreme pressure on salarymen can lead to death by overwork, or kar\u014dshi. Salarymen feel intense pressure to fulfill their duty to support their family because of the gendered expectations placed on men. According to a Washington Post article, the Japanese government struggled for years to pass a law limiting to the number of hours one can work, and the issue has been prevalent since the 1970s. In 2014, after 30 years of activism, Japan's parliament (the Japanese Diet) passed a law \"promoting countermeasures against kar\u014dshi.\"\nHowever, many Japanese still criticize the government and believe there should be some form of punishment for companies that violate work hour laws. Approximately 2,000 annual applications are filed by the families of salarymen that die of kar\u014dshi. However, the death toll may be much higher, and \"as many as 8,000 of the 30,000 annual suicides each year are thought to be work-related,\" with \"as many as 10,000 non-suicide kar\u014dshi deaths per year.\"\nKar\u014dshi, literally \"overwork death,\" was first diagnosed as a \"circulatory disease brought on by stress\" in the late 1970s after the 1973 oil crisis, which took a toll on the post-war reconstruction of Japanese industry.  Since then, the number of deaths from overwork has increased, especially at larger and more prestigious companies. In 2002, Kenichi Uchino, a 30-year-old quality-control manager at Toyota, collapsed and died after working over 80 hours unpaid overtime for six months. After this incident, Toyota announced that it would begin monitoring their workers' health and would pay for all of their overtime hours.\n\nSee also\nHansei\nJapanese blue collar workers\nJapanese management culture\nJapanese work environment\nSalaryman Kintar\u014d\nSimultaneous recruiting of new graduates\nSuicide in Japan\nWomen\n\nKyaria\u016bman, Japanese term for a career woman\nOffice lady\nGeneral\n\nThe Organization Man\nWhite-collar worker\nWork\u2013life balance\nWage slave\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Salarymen at Wikimedia Commons\n\"My Life in Corporate Japan\"\nA week in the life of a Tokyo salary man\nSalarymen: On the Way to Extinction? by Kristin Wingate, Undergraduate Journal of Global Citizenship, vol. 1, no. 1, 2011","160":"Samurai Rebellion (\u4e0a\u610f\u8a0e\u3061 \u62dd\u9818\u59bb\u59cb\u672b, J\u014di-uchi: Hairy\u014d zuma shimatsu) is a 1967 Japanese jidaigeki film directed by Masaki Kobayashi. The film is based on a short story of the same name by Yasuhiko Takiguchi. Its screenplay was written by Shinobu Hashimoto.\nFilm historian Donald Richie suggests an approximate translation for its original Japanese title: Rebellion: Receive the Wife.\n\nPlot\nIn 1725, during the Edo period of Japan, Isaburo Sasahara (Toshiro Mifune) is a vassal of the daimyo of the Aizu clan, Masakata Matsudaira. Isaburo is one of the most skilled swordsmen in the land, whose main rival is his good friend Tatewaki Asano (Tatsuya Nakadai). Isaburo is in a loveless marriage with a shrew of a woman. One day, one of the daimyo's advisors orders Isaburo's elder son Yogoro (Go Kato) to marry the daimyo's ex-concubine, Ichi (Yoko Tsukasa), even though she is the mother to one of the daimyo's sons. With much trepidation, the family agrees. Ichi and Yogoro fall in love, marry, and give birth to a daughter, Tomi.\nHowever, the daimyo's primary heir dies, and he orders Ichi to rejoin his household to care for their son and heir. The family refuses, but Ichi is coerced to return by Isaburo's younger son, as otherwise her husband and father-in-law will be ordered to commit seppuku for their insolence and insubordination. Isaburo counters that he will comply only if the heads of the daimyo and his two primary advisors are brought to him first. Isaburo sends his younger son and wife away and dismisses his household servants.\nThe daimyo's steward, accompanied by a platoon of 20 samurai, brings Ichi to the Sasahara house and tries to force her at spear point to renounce her marriage to Yogoro and join the daimyo's household. The daimyo also offers to commute Isaburo and Yogoro's sentences to life confinement in a shrine outside his castle. Instead of abandoning her husband and rejoining the daimyo, she throws herself onto a spear. Yogoro goes to her side and is killed with her in his arms. Enraged, Isaburo kills the steward's entire party, leaving the steward for last as he attempts to flee.\nBurying the dead couple, Isaburo now decides to take his case to the shogun in Edo accompanied by Tomi. Tatewaki, who is guarding the gate, cannot permit Isaburo to pass, and a climactic duel follows with his good friend. Isaburo is the victor, but assassins hidden nearby cut Isaburo down with musket fire. As Isaburo dies, Tomi's wet nurse comforts the baby.\n\nCast\nToshiro Mifune as Isaburo Sasahara\nYoko Tsukasa as Ichi Sasahara\nGo Kato as Yogoro Sasahara\nTatsuya Nakadai as Tatewaki Asano\nShigeru Koyama as Geki Takahashi\nMasao Mishima as Sanzaemon Yanase\nIsao Yamagata as Shobei Tsuchiya\nTatsuyoshi Ehara as Bunzo Sasahara\nEtsuko Ichihara as Kiku\nTatsuo Matsumura as Masakata Matsudaira\nTakamaru Sasaki as Kenmotsu Sasahara\nJun Hamamura as Hyoemon Shiomi\n\nMusic\nThe music was composed by T\u014dru Takemitsu, and is performed almost exclusively on traditional Japanese instruments, including shakuhachi, biwa, and taiko.\n\nRelease\nSamurai Rebellion received a roadshow release in Japan on 27 May 1967 where it was distributed by Toho.

It was nominated for the 1975 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. It also became one of the highest-grossing Japanese films at the Chinese box office, where it generated box office admissions in the hundreds of millions.\n\nPlot\nA young female journalist, Keiko Mitani (Komaki Kurihara), is researching an article on the history of Japanese women who were sex slaves in Asian brothels during the early 20th century. She locates Osaki (Kinuyo Tanaka), an elderly woman who lives with a number of cats in a shack in a remote village. Osaki agrees to tell her life story, and the film goes into flashback to the early 1920s. A young Osaki (Yoko Takashi) is sold by her poverty-stricken family into indentured servitude as a maid in Sandakan, British North Borneo (today\u2019s Sabah, Malaysia), at what she believes to be a hotel. At parting, Osaki's distraught and tragic mother gives her a kimono that she has woven by hand the night before her daughter's departure. The kimono will be Osaki's most treasured possession forever. The establishment is actually a brothel called Sandakan No. 8. Osaki, who is sold as a young girl, works for two years as a maid but is forced by the brothel\u2019s owners to become a prostitute. Osaki stays at Sandakan 8 until World War II, and in that period, she never experiences genuine affection outside of a brief romance with a poor farmer who abandons her when he comes one evening to the brothel and sees the disheveled and exhausted Osaki after an onslaught of service to a battalion of Japanese sailors recently docked at the town. When Osaki returns to Japan, her brother and his wife, who have bought a house with the money she sent them, tell her that she has become an embarrassment.\nOsaki returns to Sandakan. At the end of the war, she marries a Japanese man, who then dies. On returning to Japan, because of her experiences at Sandakan No. 8, she is shunned and treated like a pariah, even by her son who lives a respectable life in a large city.\n\nCast\nKomaki Kurihara \u2013 Keiko Mitani\nYoko Takahashi \u2013 Osaki as a young woman\nKinuyo Tanaka \u2013 Osaki Yamakawa, as an old woman\nTakiko Mizunoe \u2013 Okiku\nEiko Mizuhara \u2013 Ofumi\nYoko Todo \u2013 Oyae\nYukiko Yanagawa \u2013 Otake\nYoko Nakagawa \u2013 Ohana\nMasayo Umezawa \u2013 Yukiyo\nKen Tanaka \u2013 Hideo Takeuchi\nEitaro Ozawa \u2013 Tarozo\nTomoko Jinbo \u2013 Moto\nHideo Sunazuka \u2013 Yajima\nMitsuo Hamada \u2013 Yasukichi\nKaneko Iwasaki \u2013 Sato\nSiti Sundari Samad aka Siti Tanjung Perak \u2013 local people\nOmar Hitam aka Udo Omar \u2013 local people\n\nProduction\nSandakan No. 8 was based on the 1972 book Sandakan Brothel No. 8: An Episode in the History of Lower-Class by Yamazaki Tomoko. The book focused on the \"karayuki-san\", the Japanese term for young women who were forced into sexual slavery (see sex trafficking) in Pacific Rim countries and colonies during the early 20th century. The book created controversy in Japan, where the subject of the karayuki-san was not discussed in public or in scholarly examinations of Japanese history. Yamazaki\u2019s book was a best-seller and won the Oya Soichi Prize for Non-Fiction Literature; she quickly followed up with a sequel, The Graves of Sandakan. Filmmaker Kei Kumai combined the two books into the screenplay for Sandakan No. 8.\n\nAwards and release\nSandakan No. 8 won Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actress for Kinuyo Tanaka in the 1975 Kinema Jumpo Awards. Tanaka won the Best Actress Award at the 25th Berlin International Film Festival, while Kumai received a Best Director nomination at that festival.\nSandakan No. 8 was nominated for the 1975 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but it lost to another production directed by a Japanese filmmaker: Akira Kurosawa's Dersu Uzala, which was the Soviet Union entry for the Oscar competition.\nThe film was not released in the U.S. until late 1976. Roger Ebert, in a review published in the Chicago Sun-Times, noted the film\u2019s \"material is sensitively handled...the movie is not explicit.\"  But Janet Maslin, in a review for The New York Times, called it a \"film about prostitution, narrated from what is supposed to be a feminist point of view. However feminism, in this case, only means interjecting a particularly noxious form of man-hating where the pornographic touches ordinarily might be.\" To date, Sandakan No. 8 has not been commercially released in the U.S. on DVD.\n\nReception\nThe Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited Sandakan No. 8 as one of his 100 favorite films.\n\nBox office\nThe film was an overseas blockbuster in China, where it released as \u671b\u4e61 (W\u00e0ng Xi\u0101ng) in 1978. It was among the first foreign films released there after the Cultural Revolution ended. It was one of the highest-grossing Japanese films at the Chinese box office at the time, along with Kimi yo Fundo no Kawa o Watare (Manhunt). Chinese audiences related to the topic of comfort women (which occurred during the Japanese occupation of China) and it was among the earliest depictions of sexuality seen in Chinese cinemas. In Beijing alone, Sandakan grossed more than CN\u00a53.5 million ($2.08 million) at the box office. The film generated total Chinese box office admissions in the hundreds of millions.\n\nSee also\nComfort women\nJapanese migration to Malaysia\nSandakan Japanese Cemetery\nJapanese occupation of British Borneo\nList of submissions to the 48th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film\nList of Japanese submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nSandakan No. 8 at IMDb","162":"Sanjuro (Japanese: \u693f\u4e09\u5341\u90ce, Hepburn: Tsubaki Sanj\u016br\u014d) is a 1962 Japanese jidaigeki film directed by Akira Kurosawa and starring Toshiro Mifune. It is a sequel to Kurosawa's 1961 Yojimbo.\nOriginally an adaptation of the Sh\u016bgor\u014d Yamamoto novel Hibi Heian, the script was altered following the success of the previous year's Yojimbo to incorporate the lead character of that film.\n\nPlot\nNine young samurai believe that the lord chamberlain, Mutsuta, is corrupt after he tore up their petition against fraud at court. One of them tells the superintendent Kikui of this and he agrees to intervene. As the nine meet secretly to discuss this at a shrine, a r\u014dnin overhears and cautions them against trusting the superintendent. While at first they do not believe him, he saves them from an ambush. But as their rescuer is about to leave, he realises that Mutsuta and his family must now be in danger and decides to stay and help.\nBy the time the samurai get to Mutsuta's house, the chamberlain has been abducted and his wife and daughter are held prisoner there. Following the r\u014dnin's suggestion, a servant from the house gets the guards drunk, allowing the samurai to free the women. Then the group hide in a house next door to the superintendent's compound. When Mutsuta's wife asks the r\u014dnin his name, he looks out of the window at the surrounding camellia trees and says it is Tsubaki Sanj\u016br\u014d (\u693f\u4e09\u5341\u90ce), literally \"thirty-year-old camellia\". The lady then criticises \"Sanjuro\" for killing too frequently and insists that \"the best sword is kept in its sheath.\"\nSanjuro decides to get closer to the corrupt officials and joins their henchman Hanbei, who had previously offered him a job after the ambush at the shrine. Although the samurai distrustfully decide to keep watch on him, Sanjuro realises he is being followed as he walks along with Hanbei, and their shadows are easily captured and bound. Made to believe that a much larger group may be involved, Hanbei leaves to request reinforcements. Sanjuro then frees the four captured samurai, although having to kill all their guards. He tells the four to leave him tied up, then explains to Hanbei on his return that he did not wish to die in a cause in which he had no stake.\nThe chamberlain's whereabouts are not discovered until the next day, when Mutsuta's wife and daughter find a piece of the torn petition in the small stream that flows from the superintendent's compound past their hideout. Since an attack on the officials is impossible with the compound full of armed men, Sanjuro hatches a plan to get the army away by reporting to Hanbei that he saw the rebels at a temple where he was sleeping. Meanwhile he has told his group of samurai that he will send the signal to attack by floating large numbers of camellias down the stream.\nThe first part of the plan works, with the superintendent's forces rushing off to the temple; however, Hanbei becomes suspicious after catching Sanjuro trying to drop the camellias into the stream and ties him up. Just as Hanbei is preparing to kill him, the remaining corrupt officials realise that Sanjuro has tricked them\u2014his description of the temple was incorrect. They convince Hanbei not to waste any further time and instead catch up with the superintendent's forces and have them return as soon as possible. However, Sanjuro tricks the officials into giving the signal for the samurai to come to the rescue. Hanbei returns to find he has been made a fool of once again.\nMutsuta is restored to his position and the superintendent commits hara-kiri, much to the chamberlain's regret, as he wished to avoid a public scandal. As his family and the loyal samurai are celebrating, they discover that Sanjuro has slipped away. The samurai race off and find Sanjuro and Hanbei about to duel.\nSanjuro is reluctant to fight and tries to dissuade Hanbei, but Hanbei is furious at his loss of dignity and declares he can only find peace by killing Sanjuro. Hanbei draws his sword, but the faster Sanjuro kills him. When the young samurai cheer his victory, Sanjuro becomes angry and says he will kill them if they follow him. His admirers can only kneel and bow as he walks away.\n\nCast\nProduction\nThe story is primarily based on Sh\u016bgor\u014d Yamamoto's short story Hibi Heian (\u65e5\u65e5\u5e73\u5b89, lit. \"Peaceful Days\"). Originally Sanjuro was to be a straight adaptation of the story. After the success of Yojimbo the studio decided to resurrect its popular antihero, and Kurosawa reimagined the script accordingly. But despite a certain element of continuity, the eventual film turned out to be more than just a sequel to Yojimbo for the hero goes on to develop in character from the swashbuckling original.\nHe is, as before a masterless samurai who preserves his anonymity by the same means. When asked his name in Yojimbo he looks outside and names himself mulberry (Kuwabatake); in Sanjuro he chooses a camellia (Tsubaki). In both cases he gives Sanj\u016br\u014d (thirty-year-old) as his given name, although in both films he admits to being closer to forty. Having the ronin take the name of local agricultural products rather than a great house or clan reflects a populist turn in contemporary samurai movies. A crucial difference between Yojimbo and Sanjuro, however, is that there is little connection to the Western genre in the sequel. The original was set in an out-of-the-way border town where the hero deals ruthlessly with local thugs, while in Sanjuro the action centres on a Japanese feudal power struggle in a clan fortress town. There the hero realises that Hanbei, his main opponent, is a man much like himself: a social outsider (an \"unsheathed sword\" in the words of the chamberlain\u2019s wife) free to pick his own side in a conflict. The difference between them is only in the motives behind their choice.\nThere is also a greater element of social comedy, with the seasoned fighter constantly hampered by the failure to grasp the true situation by the young men he chooses to help. But while he is their superior in tactics, the lady he has just rescued confounds him by insisting that he restrain himself, since killing people is a bad habit. Although there has to be some killing, largely as result of the inept actions of his young allies, the only truly violent moment comes at the very end in the duel between Sanjuro and Hanbei. From this he walks away in a fury, because his young admirers are still unable to read human nature and understand the significance of what has just happened.\n\nRelease\nSanjuro was released on January 1, 1962 in Japan where it was distributed by Toho. The film was also released in the same year in the United States.\n\nBox office\nSanjuro was Toho's highest-grossing film in 1962, coming second place for the highest grossing Japanese productions in 1962. It earned \u00a5450.1 million in distributor rentals at the Japanese box office in 1962, exceeding King Kong vs. Godzilla, which had sold 11.2 million tickets in Japan that year.\n\nReception\nThe film has been positively received by critics. It holds a 100% rating on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 23 reviews, with a weighted average of 8.38\/10. The site's consensus reads: \"Technically impressive and superbly acted, Sanjuro is a funny, action-packed samurai adventure featuring outstanding cinematography and a charismatic performance from Toshiro Mifune\".

Judo Saga) is a 1943 Japanese martial arts drama film and the directorial debut of the Japanese film director Akira Kurosawa. First released in Japan on 25 March 1943 by Toho film studios, the film was eventually released in the United States on 28 April 1974. The film is based on the novel of the same name written by Tsuneo Tomita, the son of prominent judoka Tsunejir\u014d Tomita. It follows the story of Sanshiro, a talented though willful youth, who travels to the city in order to learn Jujutsu. However, upon his arrival he discovers a new form of self-defence: Judo. The main character is based on Saig\u014d Shir\u014d.\nThe film is seen as an early example of Kurosawa's immediate grasp of the film-making process, and includes many of his directorial trademarks, such as the use of wipes, weather patterns as reflections of character moods, and abruptly changing camera speeds. The film itself was quite influential at the time, and has been remade on no fewer than five occasions. It spawned a sequel, Sanshiro Sugata Part II, which was released in 1945 and also directed by Kurosawa.\n\nPlot\nIn 1883, Sanshiro is a talented though willful youth who wishes to become a jujutsu master by becoming a student at one of the city's martial arts schools. His first attempts to find a suitable instructor fail, until he finally finds an accomplished master, Shogoro Yano from the Shudokan Judo school, who he sees defending himself against a group of jujutsu bullies near a river. Initially, Sanshiro is physically capable, but he lacks any type of poise or reflection concerning his self-control and demeanor, even getting into merry fights at a village festival. His master believes him to be talented but lacking in discipline, describing teaching him judo as \"like giving a knife to a madman\". After being told about his lack of care about life, Sanshiro jumps into a lotus pond to prove his strength and loyalty. Clinging to a stake in the pond, he stays the whole day and night before he sees the opening of a lotus blossom that makes him find self-realization. Leaping out of the pond, he goes to Yano to ask for his forgiveness. He starts to appreciate that there is more to his life and to his art than simple muscle and brawl and soon becomes a leading student in his school.\nThe city is looking to employ one of the local martial arts schools to guide the training of its local police force, and the school of Sanshiro becomes a leading candidate along with its rival, the local school of Ry\u014di Shint\u014d-ry\u016b jujutsu led by Hansuke Murai. He first faces Kodama, a jujutsu tough that had tried to take out Shogoro in the river. The ensuing match leads to the death of Kodama after a move by Sanshiro leaves him crashing into a corner. In a scheduled competition between the two schools, Sanshiro is chosen to represent his school in a public match against Murai himself to determine which school is best to train the local police in the martial arts. The scheduled bout gets off to a slow start, but Sanshiro soon comes into his own and begins executing devastating throws which cause internal physical damage to his opponent. Although Murai tries to stand every time, energized by the memory of his daughter Sayo, he is forced to give up after the third time he is violently sent to the ground by Sanshiro.\nAfter the match, Sanshiro makes friends with his defeated opponent and is attracted to Sayo. Sayo is a local beauty, and another Ry\u014di Shint\u014d-ry\u016b jujutsu master, Higaki, competes with Sanshiro for her affections. When he challenges Sanshiro to a duel to the death, Sanshiro accepts and defeats him by inflicting permanent crippling damage to Higaki. After emerging victorious from his duel, Sanshiro prepares for his next assignment in Yokohama while being escorted on the local train by Sayo. He promises to return to her after he finishes his journey.\n\nCast\nSusumu Fujita as Sanshiro Sugata\nDenjir\u014d \u014ck\u014dchi as Sh\u014dgor\u014d Yano\nYukiko Todoroki as Sayo Murai\nRy\u016bnosuke Tsukigata as Gennosuke Higaki\nTakashi Shimura as Hansuke Murai\nRanko Hanai as Osumi Kodana\nSugisaku Aoyama as Tsunetami Iimura\nIchiro Sugai as Police Chief Michitsune Mishima\nYoshio Kosugi as Master Sabur\u014d Kodama\nKokuten K\u014dd\u014d as Buddhist Priest\nMichisabur\u014d Segawa as Wada\nAkitake K\u014dno as Yoshima Dan\nSh\u014dji Kiyokawa as Y\u016bjir\u014d Toda\nKunio Mita as K\u014dhei Tsuzaki\nAkira Nakamura as Toranosuki Niiseki\nEisabur\u014d Sakauchi as Nemeto\nHajime Hikari as Torakichi\n\nProduction\nFollowing five years of second unit director work on films such as Uma and Roppa's Honeymoon, Kurosawa was finally given the go-ahead to direct his first film, even though he himself claimed that, in films like Uma, \"I had been so much in charge of production I had felt like the director\". After hearing of a new novel from the writer Tomita Tsuneo in an advertisement, Kurosawa decided the project was for him and asked film producer Iwao Mori to buy the rights for him. Kurosawa, told that Toho wouldn't be able to buy the rights until it was published, eagerly awaited its release, to the point where he stalked bookstores night and day until he found a copy; he quickly read the book and wrote a screenplay for it. Despite his enthusiasm, Masahiro Makino was first asked to direct, but he declined.\nAccording to Japanese cinema scholar Donald Richie, the reason Kurosawa was allowed to direct the film was because he had had two film scripts printed, including one of which had won the education minister's prize. However, his work was too far away from the government requirements for a wartime film. Tomita's novel, on the other hand, was considered \"safe\", dealing, as it did, with a Japanese subject such as the martial rivalry between judo and jujitsu; being a period piece; and having a popular subject. Kurosawa deliberately went out to make a \"movie-like movie\", as he knew he would not be able to insert any particularly didactic qualities in the film.\n\nWhen he went to the board of censors (which he likened to being on trial), the film passed on the basis of recommendation by Yasujiro Ozu, who called it an important artistic achievement despite other voices claiming it was too \"British-American\". After the initial release, Japanese censors reportedly trimmed the film by 17 minutes. Some of this footage was later recovered and added to a DVD release, and the original script with the missing material still exists; intertitles are included in the release that describe what occurred in the missing parts. The 1952 re-release (from which the 2009 Criterion DVD is made) opens with (translated from the original Japanese text): \"This film has been modified from the original version of Akira Kurosawa's debut film, which opened in 1943, without consulting the director or the production staff. 1,845 feet of footage was cut in 1944 to comply with the government's wartime entertainment policies.\" \nPaul Anderer emphasized Kurosawa's attention to the character of Gennosuke Higaki in the film. Higaki, created by Tsuneo Tomita for the novel and inspired by real life jujutsu master Mataemon Tanabe, is the film's central villain. Anderer stated: \"Kurosawa would later call Higaki his Mephistopheles and insist that he is the most interesting character in this film. Given the heightened drama of every scene he invades, the visual association between him and the shadow, as well as the sound of his voice -- cued as it is to the raging wind -- Higaki does spur Kurosawa to deviate from the path of a conventional wartime 'spiritist' film. The director's focus shifts away; from a wholesome story of a guileless youth, perfecting his skill along with his pure Japanese heart. He stays strangely fixed on Higaki and conveys an unmistakable sympathy for the devil, no matter the moral consequence.\"\n\nThemes\nThe central theme of the film is the education and initiation of Sugata and the way in which, whilst learning the ways of Judo, he also learns about himself. The film's central scene concerning this theme is when, after being accosted by Yano for getting involved in a streetfight, Sugata leaps into the cold waters near Yano's temple and stays there in order to show his master his dedication, and the fact that he is neither afraid to live nor to die. However, the resident monk chides him for this self-serving display, and he emerges from the pond a humbler man after witnessing the blooming of a lotus blossom, a Buddhist symbol of purity.\n\nRemakes\nFilms\nSanshiro Sugata has been remade five times since it was initially released, although these versions are even harder to find in the west than the original. The 1955 and 1965 versions share the script of the original versions, whereas the subsequent three releases are all based on the novel rather than Kurosawa's screenplay.\n\nSugata Sanshir\u014d (1955) - Directed by Shigeo Tanaka\nSugata Sanshir\u014d (1965) - Directed by Seiichir\u014d Uchikawa\nNinky\u014d Yawara Ichidai (1966) - Directed by Sadao Nakajima\nSugata Sanshir\u014d (released in the Philippines as The Master; 1970) - Directed by Kunio Watanabe\nSugata Sanshir\u014d (1977) - Directed by Kihachi Okamoto\n\nTelevision\nSugata Sanshir\u014d (1970) was aired on NTV, started by Muga Takewaki.\nSugata Sanshir\u014d (1978-79) was aired on NTV, started by Hiroshi Katsuno and Masaya Oki.\n\nSee also\nList of incomplete or partially lost films\nSegata Sanshiro\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nSanshiro Sugata at IMDb\nSanshiro Sugata at AllMovie\nSanshiro Sugata (in Japanese) at the Japanese Movie Database\n\"Sanshiro Sugata\": Kurosawa's Elegy for the Reluctant Kamikaze at Bright Lights Film Journal.","164":"Sanshiro Sugata Part II (Japanese: \u7e8c\u59ff\u4e09\u56db\u90ce, Hepburn: Zoku Sugata Sanshir\u014d, a.k.a. Judo Saga II) is a 1945 Japanese action drama film written and directed by Akira Kurosawa. It is based on the novel by Tsuneo Tomita, son of Tomita Tsunejir\u014d, the earliest disciple of judo. It was filmed in early 1945 in Japan towards the end of World War II. Unlike the original Sugata Sanshiro, the sequel is in part considered a propaganda film.\nIt is believed by some to be the earliest known film sequel whose title is simply the original title followed by a number, predating the likes of Quatermass II (1957) by several years, although possibly mistaken as the added kanji \u7e8c (Zoku) is not a numeral but simply means \"Continuation\" or \"Sequel\" sort of in the style of Another Thin Man or The Invisible Man Returns.\n\nPlot\nIn the 1880s, a martial arts student continues his quest to become a judo master, from that discipline's founder. Eventually, he learns enough to demonstrate his skill in a boxing match between American and Japanese fighters at the end of the movie. The whole movie is actually about the rivalry between karate and judo martial artists, and Sanshiro's struggle to do what is right. On one side there is the morally right thing to do, and on the other the rules in the dojo. Eventually he decides to break all of the rules, leave the dojo, fight the American boxer and, also, the karate masters.

In the original film, \"fighting is but a vehicle for a larger spiritual quest\" whereas the sequel \"promotes Japanese judo's superiority to Western boxing\", setting a different tone. Christian Blauvelt, writing a review for Slant Magazine, agreed that the film is somewhat tainted by noticeable propaganda. Sanshiro's victory against the American boxer \"is taken as a sign of Japanese physical, moral, and spiritual superiority\". He also noted that \"Sanshiro comes to the aid of defenseless Japanese who are being beaten up by a drunken American sailor\". Historian David Conrad has contextualized the film as a \"crude bit of wish-fulfillment\" during the last weeks of World War II when Japan's leaders \"moved the war's frontlines to the only place it could still be won: the realm of fantasy.\"\nChristian Blauvelt however saw merit in the film as illustrated in the battle against the brothers of Gennosuke Higaki, the original film's villain: \"Their battle takes place on a snow-covered hillside and matches the natural beauty of the first film's windstorm finale. In his years apprenticing at P.C.L. [Photo Chemical Laboratories, which later became Toho], Kurosawa had become exposed to the films of John Ford, many of which played in Japan, before the foreign-film embargo that accompanied Japan's declaration of war on the United States in 1941. Like Ford, Kurosawa would emphasize the place of landscape in his films, often pairing his characters' emotional turmoil with the Elements. The rain in One Wonderful Sunday, Rashomon, or Seven Samurai, the beating sun in Stray Dog, the sinkhole in Drunken Angel, the snowfall in The Idiot, the wind in Dersu Uzala, and the crashing waves of Kagemusha would express some emotional anguish of the characters and, as a kind of cinematic synecdoche, society as a whole.\"\n\nHome media\nThe film was released in 2010 as part of a 4 DVD box set of Kurosawa's early films under the following designation:\n\nEclipse Series 23: The First Films of Akira Kurosawa.

Aoye hires Hiruta as his attorney, but Hiruta is desperate for money to care for his daughter, Masako (Y\u014dko Katsuragi), who has a terminal case of tuberculosis, so he accepts a bribe from the editor of Amour in exchange for agreeing to throw the trial. The trial proceeds badly for the plaintiffs and Hiruta, struck by the kindness of Aoye and Saijo towards Masako and Masako's disgust at the way he is handling the case, becomes ridden with guilt. Masako dies near the end of the trial, convinced that Aoye and Saijo will win, since they have the truth on their side. On the final day in court Hiruta, prodded by his conscience, confesses to taking the bribe and Amour loses the case.\n\nCast\nToshiro Mifune - Ichir\u014d Aoye\nTakashi Shimura - Attorney Hiruta\nYoshiko Yamaguchi - Miyako Saijo\nNoriko Sengoku - Sumie\nY\u014dko Katsuragi - Masako Hiruta\nEitaro Ozawa - Hori\nShinichi Himori - Editor Asai\nIchiro Shimizu - Arai\nFumiko Okamura - Miyako's mother\nMasao Shimizu - Judge\nKokuten K\u014dd\u014d - Old Man\nBokuzen Hidari - Drunk\nK\u014dji Mitsui - Photographer\n\nCommentary\nScandal was described by Kurosawa himself as a protest film about \"the rise of the press in Japan and its habitual confusion of freedom with license.

Taking place in 1586 in the Sengoku period of Japanese history, it follows the story of a village of desperate farmers who seek to hire samurai to combat bandits who will return after the harvest to steal their crops.\nAt the time, the film was the most expensive film made in Japan. It took a year to shoot and faced many difficulties. It was the second-highest-grossing domestic film in Japan in 1954. Many reviews compared the film to westerns.\nSeven Samurai is regarded as one of the greatest and most influential films in cinema history. Since its release, it has consistently ranked highly in critics' lists of greatest films, such as the BFI's Sight & Sound and Rotten Tomatoes polls. It was also voted the greatest foreign-language film of all time in BBC's 2018 international critics' poll. It is regarded as one of the most \"remade, reworked, and referenced\" films in cinema.\n\nPlot\nIn 1586, a bandit gang discusses raiding a mountain village, but their chief decides to wait until after the harvest for a better haul. The villagers overhear this and turn to Gisaku, the village elder and miller. Gisaku plans to hire samurai to protect the village. Since they have no money and can only offer food as payment, Gisaku advises the villagers to find hungry samurai.\nTraveling to a nearby town, the villagers find Kambei, an aging but experienced r\u014dnin, whom they see rescuing a young boy from a thief. A young samurai named Katsushir\u014d asks to become Kambei\u2019s disciple. The villagers ask for Kambei\u2019s help, and he reluctantly agrees. He then recruits his old comrade-in-arms Shichir\u014dji, along with Gorobei, Heihachi, and Ky\u016bz\u014d, a taciturn master swordsman whom Katsushir\u014d regards with awe. Kikuchiyo, a wild and eccentric samurai-poser, is eventually accepted as well after attempts to drive him away fail.\nArriving at the village, the samurai and farmers slowly begin to trust each other. Katsushir\u014d meets Shino, a farmer's daughter disguised as a boy by her father, and begins a relationship with her despite knowing the difference in their social classes prohibits it. Later, the samurai are angered when Kikuchiyo brings them armor and weapons, which the villagers acquired by killing other samurai injured or fleeing from battle. Kikuchiyo angrily retorts that samurai are responsible for much of the suffering farmers endure, revealing he is an orphaned farmer's son. The samurai's anger turns to shame.\nKambei arms the villagers with bamboo spears, organizes them into squads, and trains them. Three bandit scouts are spotted; two are killed, while the last reveals their camp's location before the villagers execute him. The samurai burn down the camp in a pre-emptive strike. Rikichi, a troubled villager aiding the samurai, breaks down when he sees his wife, who was kidnapped and made a concubine during a previous raid. Upon seeing Rikichi, she runs back into a burning hut to her death. Heihachi is killed by a gunshot while trying to stop Rikichi from pursuing her. At Heihachi's funeral, the saddened villagers are inspired by Kikuchiyo, who raises a banner Heihachi made to represent the six samurai, Kikuchiyo, and the village.\nWhen the bandits finally arrive, they are confounded by the new fortifications, which include a moat and high wooden fences. They burn the village's outlying houses, including Gisaku's mill. Gisaku's family tries to save him when he refuses to abandon it, but all perish except a baby rescued by Kikuchiyo. The bandits then besiege the village, but many are killed as the defenders thwart every attack.\nThe bandits possess three matchlock muskets. Ky\u016bz\u014d ventures out alone and captures one; an envious Kikuchiyo abandons his squad to bring back another. However, Kikuchiyo's absence allows a handful of bandits to infiltrate his post and kill several farmers, and Gorobei is slain defending his position. That night, Kambei predicts that the bandits will make one final assault due to their dwindling numbers.\nMeanwhile, Katsushir\u014d and Shino's relationship is discovered by her father, who is enraged that her virginity has been taken and beats her. Kambei and the villagers intervene; Shichir\u014dji reasons that such behavior is normal before battle and that they should be forgiven.\nThe next morning, the defenders allow the remaining bandits to enter the village and ambush them. As the battle nears its end, the bandit chief hides in the women's hut and shoots Ky\u016bz\u014d dead with his musket. An enraged Kikuchiyo charges in and is shot as well, but kills the chief before dying. The remaining outlaws are slain.\nAfterward, Kambei, Katsushir\u014d and Shichir\u014dji stand in front of the funeral mounds of their comrades, watching the joyful villagers sing while planting their crops. Katsushir\u014d and Shino meet one last time, but Shino walks past him to join in the planting as Katsushiro contemplates whether to stay or go. Kambei declares to Shichir\u014dji that it is another pyrrhic victory for the samurai: \"The victory belongs to those peasants. Not to us.\"\n\nCast\nThe seven samurai\nTakashi Shimura as Kambei Shimada (\u5cf6\u7530\u52d8\u5175\u885b, Shimada Kambei), a war-weary but honorable and strategic r\u014dnin, and the leader of the seven\nYoshio Inaba as Gor\u014dbei Katayama (\u7247\u5c71\u4e94\u90ce\u5175\u885b, Katayama Gor\u014dbei), a skilled archer, who acts as Kambei's second-in-command and helps create the master-plan for the village's defense\nDaisuke Kat\u014d as Shichir\u014dji (\u4e03\u90ce\u6b21), Kambei's old friend and former lieutenant\nSeiji Miyaguchi as Ky\u016bz\u014d (\u4e45\u8535), a serious, stone-faced and supremely skilled swordsman\nMinoru Chiaki as Heihachi Hayashida (\u6797\u7530\u5e73\u516b, Hayashida Heihachi), an amiable though less-skilled fighter, whose charm and wit maintain his comrades' morale in the face of adversity\nIsao Kimura as Katsushir\u014d Okamoto (\u5ca1\u672c\u52dd\u56db\u90ce, Okamoto Katsushir\u014d), the untested son of a wealthy, land-owning samurai, whom Kambei reluctantly takes in as a disciple\nToshiro Mifune as Kikuchiyo (\u83ca\u5343\u4ee3), a humorous, mercurial and temperamental rogue who lies about being a samurai, but eventually proves his worth and resourcefulness\n\nVillagers\nYoshio Tsuchiya as Rikichi (\u5229\u5409), a hotheaded villager\nBokuzen Hidari as Yohei (\u4e0e\u5e73), a timid old man\nYukiko Shimazaki as Rikichi's wife\nKamatari Fujiwara as Manz\u014d (\u4e07\u9020), a farmer who disguises his daughter as a boy to try to protect her from the samurai\nKeiko Tsushima as Shino (\u5fd7\u4e43), Manz\u014d's daughter\nKokuten K\u014dd\u014d as Gisaku (\u5100\u4f5c), the village patriarch, referred to as \"Grandad\"\nYoshio Kosugi as Mosuke, one of the farmers sent to town to hire the samurai\n\nOthers\nShinpei Takagi as the bandit chief\nShin Otomo as the bandit second-in-command\nHaruo Nakajima as a bandit scout killed by Ky\u016bz\u014d\nEijir\u014d T\u014dno as a thief\nAtsushi Watanabe as a bun seller\nToshio Takahara as Samurai with a Gun\nJun Tatara as a coolie\nSachio Sakai as a coolie\nTakeshi Seki as a coolie\nTatsuya Nakadai (uncredited) as a samurai wandering through town\n\nProduction\nWriting\nAkira Kurosawa had originally wanted to direct a film about a single day in the life of a samurai. Later, in the course of his research, he discovered a story about samurai defending farmers. According to actor Toshiro Mifune, the film was originally going to be called Six Samurai, with Mifune playing the role of Ky\u016bz\u014d. During the six-week scriptwriting process, Kurosawa and his screenwriters realized that \"six sober samurai were a bore\u2014they needed a character that was more off-the-wall\". Kurosawa recast Mifune as Kikuchiyo and gave him creative license to improvise in his performance. During the six-week scriptwriting process, the screenwriters were not allowed visitors or phone calls.\nKurosawa and the writers were innovative in refining the theme of the assembly of heroic characters to perform a mission. According to Michael Jeck's DVD commentary, Seven Samurai was among the first films to use the now-common plot element of the recruiting and gathering of heroes into a team to accomplish a specific goal, a device used in later films such as The Guns of Navarone, Sholay, the western remake The Magnificent Seven, and Pixar's animated film A Bug's Life. Film critic Roger Ebert speculates in his review that the sequence introducing the leader Kambei (in which the samurai shaves off his topknot, a sign of honor among samurai, in order to pose as a monk to rescue a boy from a kidnapper) could be the origin of the practice, now common in action movies, of introducing the main hero with an undertaking unrelated to the main plot.\nOther plot devices such as the reluctant hero, romance between a local woman and the youngest hero, and the nervousness of the common citizenry, had appeared in other films before this, but were combined in this film.\n\nSet design\nKurosawa refused to shoot the peasant village at Toho Studios and had a complete set constructed at Tagata on the Izu Peninsula, Shizuoka. Although the studio protested against the increased production costs, Kurosawa was adamant that \"the quality of the set influences the quality of the actors' performances... For this reason, I have the sets made exactly like the real thing. It restricts the shooting but encourages that feeling of authenticity.\"\nHe also spoke of the \"intense labour\" of making the film: \"It rained all the time; we didn't have enough horses. It was just the kind of picture that is impossible to make in this country.\"\n\nFilming\nLong before it was released, the film had already become a topic of wide discussion. After three months of pre-production, it had 148 shooting days spread out over a year\u2014four times the span covered in the original budget, which eventually came to almost half a million dollars. Toho Studios closed down production at least twice. Each time, Kurosawa calmly went fishing, reasoning that the studio had already heavily invested in the production and would allow him to complete the picture. The film's final battle scene, originally scheduled to be shot at the end of summer, was shot in February in near-freezing temperatures. Mifune later recalled that he had never been so cold in his life.\nThrough the creative freedom provided by the studio, Kurosawa made use of telephoto lenses, which were rare in 1954, as well as multiple cameras which allowed the action to fill the screen and place the audience right in the middle of it. \"If I had filmed it in the traditional shot-by-shot method, there was no guarantee that any action could be repeated in exactly the same way twice.\" He found it to be very effective and he later used it in movies that were less action-oriented. His method was to put one camera in the most orthodox shooting position, another camera for quick shots and a third camera \"as a kind of guerrilla unit\". This method made for very complicated shoots, for which Kurosawa choreographed the movement of all three cameras by using diagrams.\nThe martial arts choreography for the film was led by Yoshio Sugino of the Tenshin Sh\u014dden Katori Shint\u014d-ry\u016b. Initially Junzo Sasamori of the Ono-ha Itto-ryu worked with Sugino, but he was asked by the Ministry of Education to teach in Europe during production.\n\nEditing\nDuring filming, Kurosawa quickly earned a reputation with his crew as the \"world's greatest editor\" because of his practice of editing late at night throughout the shooting. He described this as a practical necessity that is incomprehensible to most directors, who on major productions spent at least several months with their editors assembling and cutting the film after shooting is completed.:\u200a89\n\nSoundtrack\nKurosawa had a heightened interest in the soundtracks of his films. For Seven Samurai, he collaborated for the seventh and penultimate time with friend and composer Fumio Hayasaka. Hayasaka was already seriously ill when Kurosawa visited him during the filming of Seven Samurai and he died of tuberculosis on October 15, 1955, at the age of 41, while Kurosawa was filming I Live in Fear, his next film, which Hayasaka was unable to complete.\n\nThemes\nIn analyzing the film's accuracy to sixteenth century Japan, Philip Kemp discusses the similarities between the samurai and the bandits.\nKenneth Turan notes that the long runtime \"reflects the entirety of the agricultural year, from planting to gorgeous blossoming to harvesting.\" Historian David Conrad notes that at the time of the movie's release, nearly half of the Japanese population was still employed in agriculture. Although farm incomes were already rising as part of the Japanese economic miracle that would transform rural and urban lives in the 1950s and 60s, many of the village conditions depicted in the movie were still familiar to audiences in 1954.\n\nRelease\nTheatrical\nAt 207 minutes, including a five-minute intermission with music, Seven Samurai was the longest film of Kurosawa's career. Fearing that International audiences would be unwilling to sit through the entire picture, Toho Studios, along side Kurosawa himself, originally removed 50 minutes from the film for International distribution & reshowing in Japan. This \"General Release\" cut distributed around the world until the 1990s; since then, the complete version is usually seen.\nThe film was released in the United States in 1955, initially under the title The Magnificent Seven. Following the 1960 release of the American remake The Magnificent Seven, the Japanese film's title reverted to its original Seven Samurai in the United States.\n\nHome media\nPrior to the advent of DVD, various edited versions were distributed on video, but most DVDs and Blu-rays contain Kurosawa's complete original version, including its five-minute intermission. Since 2006, the Criterion Collection's US releases have featured their own exclusive 2K restoration, whereas most others, including all non-US Blu-rays, have an older HD transfer from Toho in Japan.\n\n4K restoration\nIn 2016, Toho carried out a six-month-long 4K restoration, along with Kurosawa's Ikiru (1952). As the whereabouts of Seven Samurai's original negative are unknown, second-generation fine-grain positive and third-generation duplicate negative elements were used. It is available as a Digital Cinema Package from the British Film Institute. This version was first released on 4K Blu-ray in Japan as standard-dynamic-range video on June 2023 and will have a limited HDR10 home video release by the British Film Institute on October 2024.\n\nReception\nBox office\nSeven Samurai was well received by Japanese audiences, earning a distribution rental income of \u00a5268 million, within the first twelve months of its release. It was Japan's third-highest-grossing film of 1954, out-grossing Godzilla, which had sold 9.7 million tickets and grossed an inflation-adjusted equivalent of \u00a513.7 billion or $105,000,000 (equivalent to $196,000,000 in 2023) by 1998.\nOverseas, the box-office income for the film's 1956 North American release is currently unknown. The film's 2002 re-release grossed $271,841 in the United States and $4,124 in France. At the 2002 Kurosawa & Mifune Festival in the United States, the film grossed $561,692. This adds up to at least $833,533 grossed in the United States. Other European re-releases between 1997-2018 sold 27,627 tickets.\n\nCritical response\nWhile it initially received mixed reviews from Western critics, Seven Samurai is now considered one of the greatest films in history. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a perfect approval rating of 100% based on 95 reviews, with an average rating of 9.6\/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Arguably Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece, The Seven Samurai is an epic adventure classic with an engrossing story, memorable characters, and stunning action sequences that make it one of the most influential films ever made\". It currently ranks 18th on their action\/adventure voting list, and third on their top 100 art house and international films. On Metacritic, it received a 98 out of 100 based on 7 critic reviews. On Sensacine, the film received a 4.3 out of 5 based on 3 critic reviews.\nUpon its initial US release as The Magnificent Seven, film critic Wanda Hale reviewed the film in New York Daily News and rated it four stars. She noted it was very different from Kurosawa's previous film Rashomon (1950) in that it was \"an action picture\" but Kurosawa \"has exceeded himself\". She praised Kurosawa's storytelling for \"his deep perception of human nature\" and \"awareness that no two people are alike,\" his \"sensitive, knowing direction\" that \"never lets audiences lose interest\" in the plot, his talent for making the battle scenes and violent action \"terrifically exciting to audiences\" and his ability to naturally weave humor and romance between the serious action. She praised the \"inspired performances\" of the cast, including Takashi Shimura and Toshiro Mifune, among other actors.\nMany critics outside of Japan have compared the film to westerns. Bosley Crowther, writing for The New York Times, compared it to High Noon Film historian Peter Cowie quoted Kurosawa as saying, \"Good westerns are liked by everyone. Since humans are weak, they want to see good people and great heroes. Westerns have been done over and over again, and in the process, a kind of grammar has evolved. I have learned from this grammar of the western.\" Cowie continues this thought by saying, \"That Seven Samurai can be so seamlessly transposed to an American setting underlines how carefully Kurosawa had assimilated this grammar.\"\nIn 1982, it was voted third in the Sight & Sound critics' poll of greatest films. In the 2002 Sight & Sound critics' poll the film was ranked 11th. In the Sight & Sound directors' poll, it was voted 10th in 1992 and number nine in 2002. It ranked 17th on the 2012 Sight & Sound critics' poll, in both cases being tied with Kurosawa's own Rashomon (1950). It ranked 17th in 2012 Sight & Sound directors' poll.\nIn 1998, the film was ranked 5th in Time Out magazine's Top 100 Films (Centenary). Entertainment Weekly voted it the 12th Greatest film of all time in 1999. In 2000, the film was ranked at No.23 in The Village Voice's 100 Greatest Films list. In January 2002, the film was voted at No. 81 on the list of the \"Top 100 Essential Films of All Time\" by the National Society of Film Critics.\nIn 2007, the film was ranked at No. 3 by The Guardian's readers' poll on its list of \"40 greatest foreign films of all time\". The film was voted at No. 57 on the list of \"100 Greatest Films\" by the prominent French magazine Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma in 2008. In 2009 the film was voted at No. 2 on the list of The Greatest Japanese Films of All Time by Japanese film magazine Kinema Junpo. Seven Samurai was ranked number one on Empire magazine's list of \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\" in 2010.\nFilm critic Roger Ebert added it to his list of Great Movies in 2001. Martin Scorsese included it on a list of \"39 Essential Foreign Films for a Young Filmmaker.\" It was also listed by Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky as one of his top ten favorite films.\nKurosawa both directed and edited many of his films, including Seven Samurai. In 2012, the Motion Picture Editors Guild listed Seven Samurai as the 33rd-best-edited film of all time based on a survey of its members. It was voted the greatest foreign-language film of all time in BBC's 2018 poll of 209 critics in 43 countries. In 2019, when Time Out polled film critics, directors, actors and stunt actors, Seven Samurai was voted the second-best action film of all time. In 2021, the film was ranked at number 7 on Time Out magazine's list of \"The 100 Best Movies of All Time\".\n\nHome media\nAs of 2017, Seven Samurai is the best-selling home video title ever released by the British Film Institute.\n\nLegacy and cultural impact\nSeven Samurai was a technical and creative watershed that became Japan's highest-grossing movie and set a new standard for the industry. It has remained highly influential, often seen as one of the most \"remade, reworked, referenced\" films in cinema.\nThere have been pachinko machines based on Seven Samurai in Japan. Seven Samurai pachinko machines have sold 94,000 units in Japan as of March 2018, equivalent to an estimated $470 million in gross revenue.\n\nRemakes\nIts influence can be most strongly felt in the Western The Magnificent Seven (1960), a film specifically adapted from Seven Samurai. Director John Sturges took Seven Samurai and adapted it to the Old West, with the samurai replaced by gunslingers. Many of The Magnificent Seven's scenes mirror those of Seven Samurai. The film's title itself comes from the US localized title of Seven Samurai, which was initially released under the title The Magnificent Seven in the United States in 1955. However, in an interview with R. B. Gadi, Kurosawa expressed how \"the American copy of The Magnificent Seven is a disappointment, although entertaining. It is not a version of Seven Samurai\".:\u200a42\u200a Stephen Prince argues that considering samurai films and Westerns respond to different cultures and contexts, what Kurosawa found useful was not their content but rather he was inspired by their levels of syntactic movement, framing, form and grammar.\nThe Invincible Six (1970), an American action film directed by Jean Negulesco, has been described as \"a knockoff of the Seven Samurai\/Magnificent Seven genre set in 1960s Iran.\"\nBattle Beyond the Stars (1980) is an American science fiction film directed by Jimmy T. Murakami and produced by Roger Corman. The film, intended as a \"Magnificent Seven in outer space\", is based on the plots of The Magnificent Seven and Seven Samurai. The movie acknowledges its debt to Seven Samurai by calling the protagonist's homeworld Akir and its inhabitants the Akira.\nThe plot of Seven Samurai was re-worked for The Seven Magnificent Gladiators (1983), an Italian sword-and-sandal film.\nThe 2004 video game Seven Samurai 20XX is a re-telling of Seven Samurai in a futuristic setting.\nThe steampunk anime series Samurai 7 (2004) is based on Seven Samurai.\nSome film critics have noted similarities between Pixar's A Bug's Life (1998) and Seven Samurai.\nSeveral elements from Seven Samurai are also argued to have been adapted for Star Wars (1977). Plot elements of Seven Samurai are also used in the Star Wars Anthology film Rogue One (2016). The Clone Wars episode \"Bounty Hunters\" (2008) pays direct homage to Akira Kurosawa by adapting the film's plot, as does The Mandalorian episode \"Chapter 4: Sanctuary\" (2019).\nDirector Zack Snyder credited Seven Samurai as being an inspiration for his 2023  space opera film Rebel Moon, which shares the plot element of villagers assembling a team of warriors to defend their farming settlement. Snyder has described the movie as \"Seven Samurai in space.\"\nSeven Swords (2005), a Hong Kong wuxia film produced and directed by Tsui Hark, has a plot revolving around seven warriors helping villagers to defend against mercenaries in homage to Seven Samurai.\n\nCultural impact\nSeven Samurai is largely touted as what made the \"assembling the team\" trope popular in movies and other media. This has since become a common trope in many action movies and heist films. Seven Samurai spawned its own subgenre of \"men-on-a-mission\" films, also known as the \"Seven Samurai formula\" where \"a team of disparate characters are grouped to undertake a specific mission.\" The formula has been widely adopted by many films and other media. Along with remakes already listed above, other examples of the \"Seven Samurai formula\" can be seen in films such as Saving Private Ryan (1998), The Dirty Dozen (1967), Star Wars (1977), The Savage Seven (1968), The 13th Warrior (1999), The Expendables, and Avengers, as well as television series such as The A-Team and The Walking Dead.\nAccording to Stephen Prince, the film's \"racing, powerful narrative engine, breathtaking pacing, and sense-assaulting visual style\" (what he calls a \"kinesthetic cinema\" approach to \"action filmmaking and exciting visual design\") was \"the clearest precursor\" and became \"the model for\" the Hollywood blockbuster \"brand of moviemaking\" that emerged in the 1970s. The visuals, plot, dialogue and film techniques of Seven Samurai inspired a wide range of filmmakers, ranging from Steven Spielberg and George Lucas to Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino. According to Prince, Kurosawa was \"a mentor figure\" to an emerging generation of American filmmakers, such as Spielberg and Lucas, who went on to develop the Hollywood blockbuster format in the 1970s.\nElements from Seven Samurai have been borrowed by many films. Examples include plot elements in films such as Three Amigos (1986) by John Landis, borrowed scenes in George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road (2015), and various elements (including visual elements and the way the action, suspense and movement are presented) in the large-scale battle scenes of films such as The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002), The Matrix Revolutions (2003) and numerous Marvel Studios films. The opening action scene (where the hero is introduced in an action scenario unrelated to the rest of the plot) later seen in many action films (such as the pre-title scenes in James Bond films) has origins in Seven Samurai, whose first action scene has Kambei posing as a monk to save a boy from a kidnapper. A visual element from Seven Samurai that has inspired a number of films is the use of rain to set the tone for action scenes; examples of this include Blade Runner (1982), The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, and The Matrix Revolutions. Seven Samurai's film editing technique of cutting on motion and the mentor\u2013student dynamics in the plot (also seen in other Kurosawa films) have also been widely adopted by Hollywood blockbusters (such as Marvel films).\nSholay (1975), a \"Curry Western\" Indian film written by Salim\u2013Javed (Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar) and directed by Ramesh Sippy, has a plot that was loosely styled after Seven Samurai. Sholay became the most commercially successful Indian film and revolutionized Hindi cinema.

According to Bryan Young of Syfy Wire, the Marvel Cinematic Universe films The Avengers (2012) and Avengers: Infinity War (2018) also owe \"a great debt to\" Seven Samurai, noting a number of similar plot and visual elements. Other examples of films that reference Seven Samurai include the Australian science fiction film Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (1981), the American comedy film Galaxy Quest (1999), and the 2016 remake of The Magnificent Seven.\nAmerican author Helen DeWitt's debut novel The Last Samurai heavily features Seven Samurai as the title is a reference to the movie and characters within the novel watch and respond to the movie throughout the book.\n\nAwards and nominations\nVenice Film Festival (1954)\nWinner \u2013 Silver Lion \u2013 Akira Kurosawa\nNominated \u2013 Golden Lion \u2013 Akira Kurosawa\nMainichi Film Award (1955)\nWinner \u2013 Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Seiji Miyaguchi\nBritish Academy Film Awards (1956)\nNominated \u2013 BAFTA Award for Best Film\nNominated \u2013 BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actor \u2013 Toshiro Mifune\nNominated \u2013 BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actor \u2013 Takashi Shimura\nAcademy Awards (1957)\nNominated \u2013 Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Black-and-White \u2013 So Matsuyama\nNominated \u2013 Best Costume Design, Black-and-White \u2013 Kohei Ezaki\nJussi Awards (1959)\nWinner \u2013 Best Foreign Director \u2013 Akira Kurosawa\nWinner \u2013 Best Foreign Actor \u2013 Takashi Shimura\n\nSee also\nList of films considered the best\nList of historical drama films of Asia\nEdo no Gekitou a 1979 Japanese jidaigeki drama inspired by the film and produced by Toho\nList of films with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, a film review aggregator website\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nSeven Samurai at IMDb\nSeven Samurai at AllMovie\nSeven Samurai at Metacritic \nSeven Samurai at Box Office Mojo\nSeven Samurai at Rotten Tomatoes\nA Time of Honor: Seven Samurai and Sixteenth-Century Japan an essay by Philip Kemp at the Criterion Collection\nThe Hours and Times: Kurosawa and the Art of Epic Storytelling an essay by Kenneth Turan at the Criterion Collection","167":"Seven Samurai 20XX (20XX \u4e03\u4eba\u306e\u4f8d, 20XX: Shichinin no Samurai) is a PlayStation 2 game released by Sammy Studios in 2004. Its story and concept are based upon Akira Kurosawa's 1954 movie Seven Samurai. Rights for the production of the game were given by the Kurosawa production, with character designs by French artist M\u0153bius and the composition of the music by Ryuichi Sakamoto.\nSeven Samurai 20XX is a re-telling of Seven Samurai in a futuristic setting. It takes various liberties with the original story to better suit the post setting and introduces anime and modern styled designs. The game follows seven samurai as they fight off an immense army of mutants, cyborgs and other inhuman creatures in an attempt to bring about a regime of peace for those in need. The player takes the role of Natoe, a samurai, and is sent through various locations of post-Japan to fight off hundreds of enemies with a twin-sworded fighting style known as Nitou-Ryu.\nThe year is 20XX and the setting is Japan. Humans and Humanoids, the latter being various mutants, cyborgs, and robots, maintain a delicate balance in a large, unnamed city (somewhat resembling a post-apocalyptic Tokyo) where the power and balance of the city is maintained by a large structure known as the Steeple of light. Its source of power is a young girl named the Child of Heaven. When the child is stolen by the humanoids in order to break the balance and initiate war, the child then goes missing from her inhuman captors and is held by several villagers to ransom the city for money. When the humanoids and various Agents of the city set out to retrieve her and her Sacred Jewel, the villagers quickly find themselves in danger and look for Samurai (known in the game as \"hunters\") to protect them.\n\nGameplay\nSeven Samurai 20XX is a hack and slash video game, as the protagonist of the game is faced with the task of destroying overwhelming hordes of enemies with his swords. Like many others of its genre, it utilizes a combo system, showing the player how many uninterrupted hits they have inflicted upon their opponents.\nThe main point of the game is to constantly utilize the second sword which is carried in the protagonist's sheath, allowing the player to achieve a larger combo score. Skill-related battle commands such as the Nitou-Ryu mode allow the player to wield a second katana for a limited time, or increase the speed, range and power of the player's combos.\n\nBattle maneuvers\nNitou-Ryu mode is a duration of time engaged when the player presses the L1 and R1 triggers on the PlayStation 2 controller. It permits the protagonist to use a second blade for a limited amount of time to increase attack power and range of the weapons. As the player progresses in the game, the length of the bar can be increased.\nA Just Guard allows the player to deflect an enemy's attack with skillfully timed uses of the triangle button. It allows the player to avoid damage and generates a counter-attack opportunity. This move also fully refills the Nitou-Ryu timer to 100% of its capacity.\nA Just Step is executed with proper timing of the X button and allows the player to avoid an enemy's attack and \"step\" (in-game, it looks more akin to a teleport) behind the enemy for a counter-attack. This move partially refills the Nitou-Ryu timer. A Just Attack allows Natoe to travel in the direction of one or more enemies at great speed, breaking their defense. This move also partially refills the Nitou-Ryu meter. The game also incorporates various Street Fighter-like combos and \"Charge attacks\" which occur when holding the square button at various combos and when dashing with the X button.\n\nPlot\nWhile the story is based on the film Seven Samurai, its story and plot have more in common with its animated counterpart, Samurai 7. The storyline is divided into chapters:\n\nThe game begins as a young samurai known as Natoe is passing through the town during the humanoid invasion of the city. As he passes through the ruined city, he encounters several humanoid foot soldiers, defeating them. He then encounters the Humanoid known as Zex. After seriously wounding him, he meets the fleeing villagers who inquire if he can help protect their village from future humanoid attacks. Natoe declines, and leaves the villagers, fighting more humanoids along the way.\nAfter encountering his childhood friend Jodie, Natoe works his way through the city, finishing off the remaining humanoids from the prior invasion. He eventually meets up with Kanbei, who convinces him to help out the villagers or they will be overrun by the next invasion of Humanoids. Natoe reluctantly agrees.\nHowever, Kanbei realizes that they need more samurai to defend the village. They venture out into various areas to recruit 5 more skilled warriors. Natoe eventually finds the thief Totsuma in the city's Scrapyard area. Natoe defeats Necryl, earning Totsuma's trust and place on the team. Kanbei now tells the team of his former war ally Rojie, and the team set out to the main part of the city to locate him.\nNatoe and the others arrive in the heart of the bustling city to find the whereabouts of Rojie. Discovering his occupation as a bodyguard for a female mob leader named Salla, Natoe goes off to find him, defeating leagues of street thugs and the drug dealer Kyric in the process. He meets the friendly warrior Eight before leaving the district.\nRojie now on the team, Natoe recalls the man Eight and suggests to the others that he be enlisted to join the team. Noticing Eight descend into the City's underground sewers, Natoe follows. Much to his surprise, he encounters the humanoid White Fox and battles him on several occasions. At the end of the sewers, he meets the mysterious \"Man in White\" and discovers Jodie and Eight are both agents of the city. Saving Eight from the Man in White, Natoe convinces him to join the team.\n\nLeaving the city, the encourage of Natoe, Eight and Rojie make their way to the village to rendezvous with the rest of the team. Along the way Natoe encounters a team of agents from the city, as well as the enigmatic Zwei.\nReaching the village, Kanbei and the samurai become suspicious of the villagers withdrawn behavior. Natoe decides to investigate, finding out in the process Hinata's true origins and the villagers deceitful motives. Afterwards, the team come to the conclusion that Humanoids attack on the village will be occurring soon. Natoe leaves the village in an attempt to find one last samurai to help in the ensuing battle.\nNatoe arrives in the wilderness to find an angry Zex and the humanoid Fen waiting for him. Zex's massive strength causes the ground to collapse, and Natoe finds himself in an underground city called the \"Town of Warriors\". Here he encounters Ein, a humanoid able to defeat his opponents using magic. He saves the female humanoid Cue in the process, offering to help her find her lost memories in return for her assistance. Afterwards he finds Jodie who apologies for having deceived Natoe, she then tells him to find \"the traitor\" and runs off. Shortly after he is reunited with Eight who, being the traitor of the city, has had his eyes cut out. Eight returns to the village with Natoe, confident he can still fight to protect the child.\nDeciding to take the offensive, the team of Natoe, Cue and Totsuma leave the village to infiltrate the humanoid Drei's Fort, where he has been constructing new humanoid experiments using captured test subjects. Natoe also discovers the immense newly upgraded \"Zex Beast\" creature and destroys it. However, Totsuma is caught in a trap and killed when the fortress collapses.\nReturning to the village, the samurai proceed to go on the defensive and protect the city from the massive Humanoid attack. During this attack, Eight sacrifices himself by blowing up one of the entrances to the village. After the ensuing battle of thousands, Natoe works his way to a fight with Zwei, defeating her and her three warriors before she retreats.\nThe village safe for the time being, however, the \"Man In White\" informs them that the city no longer need the sacred child and that Jodie has been kidnapped by the humanoids. Natoe and Cue team up to face the last of Humanoids at a facility called the \"Library of Avalon\". As they walk through the Library, they encounter several horrific creatures called \"Guardians\", along with Cue beginning to regain her lost memories. She is eventually kidnapped by Ein however, and Natoe fights through several Humanoids, including the \"Ultimate Zex\" incarnation and the immortal Fen. After defeating them, Natoe finally confronts the powerful and mysterious being known as Ein, who battles Natoe in his original humanoid form, then absorbs Cue to become the powerful god-like being called Almana. Finding its only weak spot to be its angelic like wings, Natoe destroys them, then is able to attack its vulnerable body.\nNow having rescued Jodie, Natoe returns to village, but is confronted by the humanoid Zwei, in her last attempt to gain the power of the sacred jewel and the child. Natoe tries to fight Zwei but on a bridge and Jodie is knocked over the edge. Natoe grabs her in an attempt to pull her up but he is stabbed in back by Zwei. He succeeds in stabbing and killing Zwei, but the bridge collapses and he and Jodie fall to their death, leaving only two samurai left. After the aftermath, Kanbei quotes the original movie pertaining to their situation: \"So again we are defeated. The farmers have won. Not us.\"\n\nSteeple of Light\nThe Steeple of Light is a tower located in the middle of the city in the game's setting. It houses various clones of the Sacred child along with the current girl herself who prays with the sacred jewel, and provides power to the surrounding city and areas. When the child and jewel are kidnapped, the tower loses its power source and sends the balance of species in to a war over her power.\n\nReception\nSeven Samurai 20XX received \"mixed\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.\nThe game was criticized for its poor pacing, lack of voice acting, and linear gameplay with a lack of sufficient depth. GameSpot complained that the combat system was too direct, only requiring the player to use the square button to defeat enemies and that the combo system was unnecessary for progression. Other websites such as GamePro complained about the game being average merely due to the lineage it had to live up to due to its predecessor, Seven Samurai, and did not live up to expectations for such a legendary film.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website (in Japanese)\nSeven Samurai 20XX at MobyGames","168":"Shall We Dance? (Japanese: Shall we \u30c0\u30f3\u30b9?, Hepburn: Sharu w\u012b dansu) is a 1996 Japanese romantic comedy-drama film directed by Masayuki Suo. Its title refers to the song \"Shall We Dance?\" which comes from Rodgers and Hammerstein's The King and I. It inspired the 2004 English-language remake of the same name.\n\nPlot\nThe film begins with a close-up of the inscription above the stage in the ballroom of the Blackpool Tower: \"Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear\", from the poem Venus and Adonis by William Shakespeare. As the camera pans around the ballroom giving a view of the dancers, a voice-over explains that in Japan, ballroom dancing is treated with suspicion.\nSuccessful salaryman Shohei Sugiyama (K\u014dji Yakusho) owns a house in the suburbs, a devoted wife, Masako (Hideko Hara), and a teenage daughter, Chikage (Ayano Nakamura), and works as an accountant for a firm in Tokyo. Despite these external signs of success, however, Sugiyama begins to feel as if his life has lost direction and meaning and falls into depression.\nOne night, while coming home on the Seibu Ikebukuro Line, he spots a beautiful woman with a melancholic expression looking out from the window of a dance studio: Mai Kishikawa (Tamiyo Kusakari), a well-known figure on the Western ballroom dance circuit. Becoming infatuated with her, he decides to take lessons in order to get to know her better.\nSugiyama\u2019s life changes once his classes begin. Rather than Mai, his teacher is an older woman, Tamako Tamura (Reiko Kusamura), who becomes an important mentor to him. He meets his classmates: T\u014dkichi Hattori (Yu Tokui) who joined to impress his wife, and Masahiro Tanaka (Hiromasa Taguchi) who joined to lose weight. He also meets Toyoko Takahashi (Eriko Watanabe), another student. He further discovers that one of his colleagues from work, Tomio Aoki (Naoto Takenaka), frequents the dance studio. Tomio, who is balding and mocked at work for his rigid ways, is revealed to be secretly a long-haired (via a wig) ballroom dancer. Though distant from her, the classes increase his infatuation with Mai. His secret thus becomes twofold: not only must he hide the lessons from his wife, he must also hide them from his friends and colleagues as it is considered embarrassing according to traditional Japanese customs to participate in Western ballroom dance.\nLater, after being rebuffed by Mai, Sugiyama discovers to his surprise that his passion for ballroom dance has survived her rejection. Indeed, dance, rather than Mai, has given Sugiyama the meaning in life that he was looking for.\nMasako, noticing his odd behavior, believes he is having an affair, prompting her to hire a private detective to follow him. Meanwhile, along with his classmates, Sugiyama enters an amateur competition, only to find out that his wife, having finally learned the truth from the detective (who has now become a devoted fan of ballroom dancing), is in the audience. Surprised by this, he stumbles and nearly knocks his dance partner to the floor. Though he successfully catches her, he accidentally rips the skirt of her dress off. Both leave the contest.  Sugiyama later learns that Aoki was disqualified. When Aoki is ridiculed at work after his colleagues read of his failure in the newspaper, Sugiyama stands up and tells them not to mock something they don't understand.\nAt home, Sugiyama tells his family that he has given up dance. A little while later, he is visited by Toyoko and Aoki, who try to get him to return and tell him to come to a farewell party for Mai, who is leaving for Blackpool. They hand him a letter from Mai in which she explains her own past failure at Blackpool, attributing it to her dancing alone and not truly trusting her partner and how working with Sugiyama and Toyoko reinspired her to try again.  Sugiyama at last has a real conversation with Masako about what happened, but angrily tells her he is through with dance, even when she asks him to teach her. But he gives in and they reconcile when his daughter Chikage pushes them together and he teaches her some steps.  On the way home the next day, he looks out of the train window and sees a sign in the dance studio window \u201cShall we dance, Mr. Sugiyama\u201d.  He changes his mind and heads to the party, arriving in time for the last dance, where Mai will choose her partner.  Mai approaches him and asks him \u201cShall we dance?\".\n\nCast\nK\u014dji Yakusho as Shohei Sugiyama\nTamiyo Kusakari as Mai Kishikawa\nNaoto Takenaka as Tomio Aoki\nEriko Watanabe as Toyoko Takahashi\nYu Tokui as Tokichi Hattori\nHiromasa Taguchi as Masahiro Tanaka\nReiko Kusamura as Tamako Tamura\nHideko Hara as Masako Sugiyama\nHiroshi Miyasaka as Macho\nKunihiko Ida as Teiji Kaneko\nAmie Toujou as Hisako Honda\nAyano Nakamura as Chikage Sugiyama\nKatsunari Mineno as Keiri-kacho\nTomiko Ishii as Haruko Haraguchi\nMasahiro Motoki as Hiromasa Kimoto\n\nRelease\nShall We Dance? was released on January 27, 1996, in Japan, where it was distributed by Toho.

Shall We Dance? grossed a total Japanese box office revenue of \u00a52.72 billion ($25 million).\nThe film performed strongly in American theaters, earning $9.7 million during its US release. Outside of the United States, the film grossed $33,287,618 internationally in other territories (including Japan), for a worldwide total of $43 million.\n\nCritical response\nReview aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 90% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 40 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Elegantly told by director Masayuki Suo and warmly performed, Shall We Dance? is a delightful celebration of stepping out of one's comfort zone and cutting a rug.\" Roger Ebert awarded the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, stating in the Chicago Sun Times that Shall We Dance? is \"one of the more completely entertaining movies I've seen in a while\u2014a well-crafted character study that, like a Hollywood movie with a skillful script, manipulates us but makes us like it.\"  Critic Paul Tatara noted that \"It isn't really fair to suggest that the movie's main subject is dance, though. As much as anything else, it's about the healing powers (and poetry) of simple self-expression.\"\n\nAwards\nDespite claiming unprecedented success in box office and critical acclaim, the movie did not represent Japan in the Academy Awards - it went to Gakko II, which ended up failing to secure nomination.\nAt the Japanese Academy Awards it won 14 awards: Best Film, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Director, Best Editing, Best Lighting, Best Music Score, Best Screenplay, Best Sound, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress, and Newcomer of the Year.\nThe National Board of Review gave it the award for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nForeign remakes\nShall We Dance? was remade in English by Miramax in 2004 as Shall We Dance?, starring Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez in the Yakusho and Kusakari roles respectively.

Produced by Toho Pictures and Cine Bazar and distributed by Toho Co., Ltd., it is the 31st film in the Godzilla franchise, the 29th film produced by Toho, Toho's third reboot of the franchise, and the first film in the franchise's Reiwa era. It is the first reboot of a tokusatsu series to be adapted by Anno and Higuchi, followed by Shin Ultraman (2022) and Shin Kamen Rider (2023). The film stars Hiroki Hasegawa, Yutaka Takenouchi, and Satomi Ishihara. In the film, politicians struggle with bureaucratic red tape in order to deal with the sudden appearance of a giant monster, known as Godzilla, that evolves whenever it is attacked.\nIn December 2014, Toho announced plans for a new domestic Godzilla film. Anno and Higuchi were announced as the directors in March 2015. Principal photography began in September 2015 and ended in October 2015. Inspiration for the film was drawn from the March 2011 earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear disaster in Japan. Production had a budget of \u00a51.3 billion, with advertising bringing the film's total budget to \u00a52.19 billion.\nShin Godzilla was theatrically released on July 29, 2016, it received critical acclaim from Japanese critics and mixed reviews from Western critics. The film grossed $79 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing live-action Japanese film of 2016 and was the highest-grossing Japanese-produced Godzilla film in the franchise, until Godzilla Minus One surpassed it in 2023. It received 11 Japan Academy Prize nominations and won seven, including Picture of the Year and Director of the Year.\n\nPlot\nIn 2016, the Japan Coast Guard investigates an abandoned yacht in Tokyo Bay, its boat is destroyed, and the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line is flooded with blood. After seeing a viral video of the incident, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Rando Yaguchi believes it was caused by a living creature, which is confirmed as news reports reveal its tail emerging from the ocean. Shortly thereafter, the creature moves inland, crawling through the Kamata district and the Shinagawa area of Tokyo, leaving a path of death and destruction during a disorganized and chaotic evacuation. The creature quickly evolves into a bipedal form but overheats and returns to the sea.\nThe government officials focus on military strategy and civilian safety; Yaguchi is put in charge of a task force researching the creature. With high radiation readings from the creature's path, the task force realizes that it is energized by nuclear fission. The U.S. sends a special envoy, Kayoco Anne Patterson, who reveals that Goro Maki, a disgraced, anti-nuclear zoology professor, studied mutations caused by radioactive contamination, predicting the appearance of the creature. Maki was disbelieved by both American and Japanese scientific circles. The U.S. then prevented him from making his conclusions public. The abandoned yacht in Tokyo Bay belonged to Maki, who left his research notes, jumbled into a code, on the boat before disappearing.\nThe creature\u2014named \"Godzilla,\" after Maki's research\u2014reappears in its fourth form, twice its original size, making landfall near Kamakura. The Japan Self-Defense Forces mobilize but prove ineffective as Godzilla breaks through their defenses into Tokyo. The U.S. intervenes with a massively destructive airstrike plan, prompting the evacuation of civilians and government personnel. Godzilla is wounded with MOP \"bunker-buster\" bombs but responds with destructive atomic rays fired from its mouth and dorsal plates, destroying a helicopter carrying the prime minister, along with top government officials and incinerating large swaths of Tokyo. Depleted of its energy, Godzilla goes into hibernation.\nYaguchi's team discovers that Godzilla's plates and blood work as a cooling system, theorizing that it could use a coagulating agent to freeze Godzilla. Analyzing tissue samples, it's discovered that Godzilla is an ever-evolving creature, able to reproduce asexually. The United Nations, aware of this, informs Japan that thermonuclear weapons will be used against Godzilla should the Japanese fail to subdue it in a few days; evacuations are ordered in multiple prefectures in preparation. Unwilling to see nuclear weapons detonated in Japan again, Patterson uses her political connections to buy time for Yaguchi's team, in which the interim government has little faith.\nYaguchi's team manages to decipher Goro Maki's encoded research using origami. The team adjusts its plan and procures the means to conduct its deep-freeze plan with international support. Hours before the planned nuclear attack, Japan enacts the deep-freeze plan. Godzilla is provoked into expending its atomic breath and energy against Predator and Reaper drones. The team then detonates nearby buildings and sends unmanned trains loaded with explosives toward Godzilla's feet, subduing it, and enabling tankers full of coagulant to inject it into Godzilla's mouth. Many are killed, but Godzilla is frozen solid.\nIn the aftermath, the fallout from Godzilla's attack is discovered to have a very short half-life of 20 days, and that Tokyo can soon be rebuilt. The international community agrees to cancel the nuclear attack on condition that, in the event of Godzilla's reawakening, an immediate thermonuclear strike will be executed. On Godzilla's tail, humanoid creatures appear frozen in the process of emerging.\n\nCast\nHiroki Hasegawa as Rando Yaguchi, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary. After Toho offered him the role, Hasegawa immediately accepted, stating, \"Who wouldn't want to be involved in a Godzilla production?\"\nYutaka Takenouchi as Hideki Akasaka, Aide to the Prime Minister of Japan. Takenouchi stated that the film would contain a \"deeper message\".\nSatomi Ishihara as Kayoco Anne Patterson, Special Envoy for the President of the United States. She became excited after accepting the role but stressed that her character features \"English-heavy dialogue\", stating, \"Sometimes it's so frustrating, I just want to cry\".\nThe film features several cameos and supporting appearances, including Kengo Kora, Ren Osugi, Akira Emoto, Kimiko Yo, Jun Kunimura, Mikako Ichikawa, Pierre Taki, Takumi Saito, Keisuke Koide, Arata Furuta, Sei Hiraizumi, Kenichi Yajima, Tetsu Watanabe, Ken Mitsuishi, Ky\u016bsaku Shimada, Kanji Tsuda, Issei Takahashi, Shinya Tsukamoto, Kazuo Hara, Isshin Inudo, Akira Ogata, Shingo Tsurumi, Suzuki Matsuo, Kreva, Katsuhiko Yokomitsu, and Atsuko Maeda. Mansai Nomura portrayed Godzilla through motion capture. Jun Kunimura previously appeared in Godzilla: Final Wars. Akira Emoto appeared in Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla.\nCast taken from the press notes, except where cited otherwise.\n\nThemes\nWhereas the original Godzilla film was conceived as a metaphor for the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the dangers of nuclear weapons, Shin Godzilla drew inspiration from the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster and the T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami. Many critics noted similarities to those events. Mark Schilling of The Japan Times wrote that the Godzilla creature serves \"as an ambulatory tsunami, earthquake and nuclear reactor, leaving radioactive contamination in his wake\". Roland Kelts, the author of Japanamerica, felt that the \"mobilizing blue-suited civil servants and piles of broken planks and debris quite nakedly echo scenes of the aftermath of the great Tohoku earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster.\" Matt Alt of The New Yorker drew similar parallels with \"the sight of blue-jumpsuited government spokesmen convening emergency press conferences ... [and] a stunned man quietly regarding mountains of debris, something that could have been lifted straight out of television footage of the hardest-hit regions up north. Even the sight of the radioactive monster's massive tail swishing over residential streets evokes memories of the fallout sent wafting over towns and cities in the course of Fukushima Daiichi's meltdown.\"\nRobert Rath from Zam argued that Shin Godzilla is a satire of Japanese politics, and likened the protagonist Rando Yaguchi to the Fukushima plant manager Masao Yoshida. William Tsutsui, author of Godzilla on My Mind, wrote in the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that \"Shin Godzilla leaves no doubt that the greatest threat to Japan comes not from without but from within, from a geriatric, fossilized government bureaucracy unable to act decisively or to stand up resolutely to foreign pressure.\" In his review for Forbes, Ollie Barder wrote that the film depicted the Japanese government's \"complex and corpulent bureaucratic ways ... unable to deal with a crisis in any kind of efficient or fluid way\", noting that the government members use the hierarchical system to protect their positions at the expense of citizens' lives. According to Schilling, the government officials, Self-Defense Forces officers and others working to defeat Godzilla are portrayed as hardworking and intelligent, despite \"some initial bumbling\".\nThen-prime minister Shinz\u014d Abe spoke positively of the film's pro-nationalist themes, stating, \"I think that [Godzilla's] popularity is rooted in the unwavering support that the public has for the Self-Defense Forces.\"\n\nProduction\nCrew\nDevelopment\nIn December 2014, Toho announced plans for a new Godzilla film for a 2016 release, stating, \"This is very good timing after the success of the American version this year: if not now, then when? The licensing contract we have with Legendary places no restrictions on us making domestic versions.\" The new film would have no ties to Legendary's MonsterVerse and would serve as a reboot to Toho's series. Minami Ichikawa would serve as the film's production manager and Taiji Ueda as the film's project leader. Ueda confirmed that the screenplay was in development and filming had been planned for a summer 2015 shoot. Toho would additionally put together a project team, known as \"Godzilla Conference\" or \"Godzi-con\", to formulate future projects.\nIn March 2015, Toho announced that the film would be co-directed by Hideaki Anno and Shinji Higuchi (who both collaborated on the anime Neon Genesis Evangelion), in addition to Anno writing the screenplay and Higuchi directing the film's special effects. In addition, Toho announced that the film would begin filming in the fall of 2015 set for a summer 2016 release. Promotional artwork of the new Godzilla's footprint was also released, with Toho confirming that their new Godzilla would surpass Legendary Pictures' Godzilla as the tallest incarnation to date.\nToho had approached Anno in January 2013 to direct the reboot but Anno initially declined due to falling into depression after completing Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo, stating, \"A representative from Toho contacted me directly, saying, 'We'd like to direct a new Godzilla film.' At the time, I was still recovering from EVA 3.0, and right on the spot, flatly refused the offer, 'It's impossible. Even to begin work on the next Eva is impossible.'\" However, Toho's sincerity and his longtime friend and co-director, Shinji Higuchi, eventually convinced him to accept the offer in March 2013. Anno had also refused the offer due to a lack of confidence, stating, \"I refused [the offer] since I didn't have confidence that I could exceed the first film or come close to equaling it. But I thought that if I were to come close even a little, I would have to do the same thing [as the first film].\" Mahiro Maeda provided the new design for Godzilla while Takayuki Takeya provided the maquette. Director Higuchi stated that he intended to provide the \"most terrifying Godzilla that Japan's cutting-edge special-effects movie-making can muster.\" A variety of techniques such as puppets, animatronics, and digital effects were initially considered and an upper-body animatronic was produced but went unused after Toho decided to create a completely CG Godzilla. VFX supervisor and co-editor Atsuki Sat\u014d stated, \"CG production had already been determined when I began participating. In the end, it was the best option to allow quick edits as creative visions changed and produced a high quality film.\" A colorless maquette was built for CG animators to use as a reference when rendering the CG Godzilla model. Mansai Nomura provided the motion capture performance for Godzilla.\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began on September 1, 2015, with a large on-location film shoot at Kamata station in Tokyo. It commenced on a budget of \u00a5900 million, which later rose to \u00a51.3 billion; Anno noted that \"originally, we couldn't make it with that budget\". Toho independently invested the film's production, taking a financial risk by doing so, as assisted funding from other organizations is customary for the creation of Japanese films.\nOn September 23, 2015, Toho revealed the film's official title as Shin Gojira and that the film would star Hiroki Hasegawa, Yutaka Takenouchi, and Satomi Ishihara. Producer Akihiro Yamauchi stated that the title Shin Gojira was chosen for the film due to the variety of meanings it conveys, such as either \"new\" (\u65b0), \"true\" (\u771f), or \"God\" (\u795e). Yamauchi also confirmed that the film has been planned for quite some time, stating, \"It's been in the works a long time. It's not like it was produced just because of the Hollywood Godzilla\". Principal photography wrapped at the end of October 2015, with special effects work scheduled for November 2015.\n\nMusic\nShiro Sagisu scored the film. The score features various remixes of \"Decisive Battle\" from Sagisu's Neon Genesis Evangelion score, and recycles several Akira Ifukube tracks. Anno had decided to use Ifukube's music while writing the screenplay and attempted to adapt the old Ifukube tracks to modern stereo settings but the task proved too daunting and eventually settled on using the mono mixes instead. The soundtrack was released on July 30, 2016, and sold 8,427 copies in 2 weeks.\n\nRelease\nMarketing\nIn November 2015, without any prior announcement, Toho screened a promo reel at the American Film Market for a potential sale for overseas markets, marketing the film (for a while) as Godzilla: Resurgence. In December 2015, Toho unveiled the film's first teaser trailer and teaser poster revealing Toho's new Godzilla design and the film's July 29, 2016, release date. Chunichi Sports reported the size of the new Godzilla to be 118.5 metres (389 ft) tall, over 10 metres (33 ft) taller than Legendary's Godzilla. He is the second tallest live action Godzilla in history.\nIn January 2016, images of the Godzilla suit were leaked online. In late March 2016, it was announced that Toho's Godzilla and Anno's Evangelion intellectual properties would form a \"maximum collaboration\" for merchandise in April 2016. In mid-April 2016, Toho revealed the complete design of the new Godzilla and that it is a completely CG-generated character, as well as a new trailer, details regarding the principal and supporting characters, and that the film will be released in IMAX, 4DX, and MX4D formats for its domestic release.\nFor summer 2016, the Namja Town amusement park held special Godzilla cross-promotion activities. The park unveiled a new virtual reality game, the food court produced kaiju-inspired food dishes,  and a Godzilla foot on display as though it had crashed through the roof of the attached Sunshine City Alpa shopping center. Sports equipment manufacturer Reebok released limited-edition Godzilla sneakers featuring a black reptilian skin pattern and either red or glow-in-the-dark green coloring in Japan.\n\nTheatrical\nShin Godzilla was theatrically released on July 29, 2016, in Japan in IMAX, 4DX, and MX4D in over 350 theaters and 446 screens. It had its red carpet premiere on July 25, 2016. The premiere took place in Tokyo along Kabuki-cho Central Road, with a red carpet from the Hotel Gracery Shinjuku, the hotel which has the large Godzilla head peering over, 118.5 metres in length, the same distance as the height of Godzilla.\nIn July 2016, Toho announced that the film had been sold to 100 territories (including Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America) in 19 days after opening to foreign sales and will be released in Taiwan on August 12, the Philippines on August 24, Hong Kong and Macao on August 25, and Thailand on September 8. At the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con, it was announced that Funimation would distribute the film for North America, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean for a late 2016 release as Shin Godzilla, instead of Godzilla: Resurgence, at the insistence of Toho.\nIn early September, Funimation officially announced that the film was to be given a one-week limited release in the United States and Canada from October 11\u201318 on 440 screens, in Japanese with English subtitles, making it the first Japanese Godzilla film to receive a theatrical North American release since Godzilla 2000. Funimation hosted two North American premieres for the film, one premiere on October 3 in Los Angeles and the other on October 5 in New York. Due to popular demand, Funimation extended the film's North American theatrical run with encore screenings for October 22 and select theaters offering daily screenings through October 27. That same month, Indonesian Film Censorship Board listed and registered both Shin Godzilla and Doraemon: Nobita and the Birth of Japan 2016.\nIn the UK, Altitude Films screened the film at FrightFest in Glasgow on February 24, 2017. Altitude Films later dropped the film, with The Electric confirming in a Tweet: \"the UK distributor Altitude have dropped it, and Toho aren't allowing any UK screenings at the mo  [sic].\" The UK theatrical rights were later acquired by Manga Entertainment for an August 10, 2017, release.\n\nBlack-and-white edition\nA black-and-white version of the film, titled Shin Godzilla: Orthochromatic (\u30b7\u30f3\u30fb\u30b4\u30b8\u30e9\uff1a\u30aa\u30eb\u30bd, Shin Gojira: Oruso), premiered at Ikebukuro Humax Cinemas in Tokyo on October 27, 2023 as part of the special theatrical screenings of four Godzilla films selected by Takashi Yamazaki in commemoration of the release of Godzilla Minus One. This version was conceived by Anno with Higuchi and associate director Katsuro Onoue supervising its production. The film was later screened at seven select Japanese theaters on October 28 and 29. On March 6, 2024, it was announced the black-and-white version would be released on DVD and Blu-Ray on May 1, 2024.\n\nHome media\nIn Japan, Shin Godzilla was released on DVD and Blu-ray by Toho on March 22, 2017. The film's Japan home video release sold 520,000 units for the DVD version, 100,000 units for the Blu-ray Special Edition, and 55,402 units for the Blu-ray Standard Edition, totaling 675,402 DVD and Blu-ray sales in Japan. In North America, the film was released on Blu-ray, DVD and digital on August 1, 2017, by Funimation, which featured an English dub produced by Funimation. In the United States, the Blu-ray and DVD grossed $4.5 million in video sales. In the United Kingdom, the film was released on DVD and Blu-ray by Manga Entertainment on December 4, 2017. This release also included the Funimation dub. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray in the UK on December 4. The Blu-ray edition of the film ranked at no.32 on the UK Blu-ray chart for the week ending December 16.\n\nReception\nBox office\nIn Japan, Shin Godzilla earned \u00a5625 million ($6.1 million) on its opening weekend and was number one at the box office for that weekend, placing Finding Dory at second place and One Piece Film: Gold at third place, and earned 23% more than 2014's Godzilla when it opened in Japan. It was more than triple the first weekend's gross of 2004's Godzilla: Final Wars, the previous Toho film in the series, which in the end grossed $12.3 million. The film remained at number one during its second weekend and was projected to finish at $40 million domestically. The film dropped to second place during its third weekend, topped by The Secret Life of Pets, earning $33.5 million after 17 days, topping the estimates for both 2004's Godzilla: Final Wars and 2014's Godzilla. The film reached \u00a55.3 billion ($51.63 million) a month after its release, topping the earnings for Anno's previous film Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo, which earned \u00a55,267,373,350.\nOn its sixth weekend, the film climbed back to number two, topped by Your Name, with an earning of US$3.2 million, bringing the film's total domestic gross to $60 million from 4.1 million admissions. On September 4, 2016, the film has grossed $58.18 million. After exiting the top ten in late September, the film has grossed nearly $78 million from 5.6 million admissions. Shin Godzilla became the highest grossing live-action Japanese film for 2016, and the second highest grossing film in Japan for the year. In the United States and Canada, the film grossed $1.9 million during its limited 31 day run. Outside of Japan and North America, the film was released in a handful of International markets. In Taiwan, it grossed $264,235; in Australia it grossed $84,090; in New Zealand it grossed $13,892; in Thailand it grossed $322,061; in South Korea it grossed $36,915; and in Spain it grossed $8,031. The film grossed $75.4 million in Japan and $79.3 million worldwide.\n\nCritical response\nShin Godzilla received critical acclaim in Japan, while Western critics gave it a more mixed response. The special effects and new depiction of Godzilla were praised, but the film was criticized for its long scenes, confusing dialogue, over-crowded characters and subplots. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 86% based on 73 reviews, with an average rating of 6.70\/10. The site's consensus reads: \"Godzilla: Resurgence offers a refreshingly low-fi \u2013 and altogether entertaining \u2013 return to the monster's classic creature-feature roots.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 67 out of 100 based on 14 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\nJapanese pop culture site RO65 called the film a \"masterpiece of unprecedented filmmaking\", and felt that the film retains a \"strong respect for the fundamental message within Godzilla\". Oricon Style praised directors Hideaki Anno and Shinji Higuchi for their realistic approach and the film's reality vs. idealism themes, calling it a \"world class\" Godzilla film. Cinema Today called the film a \"thrilling experience\" and a \"masterpiece\", feeling that the film was a return to form similar to 2004's Dawn of the Dead. Kazuo Ozaki from Eiga.com praised the film as well, stating, \"Hollywood, even with all its money, can't approach this kind of perfection\" while Koichi Irikura of Cinema Today called it a \"birth of a masterpiece that boldly announces the revival of a Japanese Godzilla\". Brian Ashcraft from Kotaku felt the film was a \"letdown\", though he praised the film's special effects and social reflection of Japan, he criticized the film's depiction of the human characters, stating, \"I wish the movie explored the relationships between the politicians and the researchers more instead of glossing over it\" and concluded that \"This isn't one of the best Godzilla films ever made, but it's certainly not one of the worst by any stretch, either. Godzilla: Resurgence is a series of compelling ideas in a so-so Godzilla movie\".\nOllie Barder from Forbes was surprised at \"how good\" the film was, praising Anno's classic Gainax motifs, though he was not completely fond of Godzilla's new design; he felt that the \"googly\" eyes made Godzilla look silly but that the design was more \"organic and menacing\" than previous incarnations and praised the film's depiction of Godzilla, stating, \"I really liked the way Godzilla is handled in this new movie, as it feels a lot more like the God Soldier short that both Anno and Higuchi worked on\" and concluded by stating that he \"really enjoyed\" the film and that it had a \"far more coherent plot\" than 2014's Godzilla. Marcus Goh from Yahoo felt that the film was a better reimagining than 2014's Godzilla, though he criticized parts of Godzilla's design and the protagonists' plan to stop Godzilla. Goh gave the film a 3.1 score out of 5 and concluded that it \"preserves the feel of Godzilla movies while updating it with modern responses\". Jay Hawkinson from Bloody Disgusting called the film a \"very good Godzilla movie that teeters on greatness\". However, he felt the film's drama \"didn't always work\" and that some of the English delivery felt \"canned and often corny\", particularly from Ishihara's character. Hawkinson praised the film's battle-scenes, Shiro Sagisu's score, and the film's homages to the franchise, and concluded that \"Shin Godzilla may be a reboot sans the rubber suit we've grown to love but it's unquestionably Godzilla\". Guardian chief film critic Peter Bradshaw found Ishihara \"slightly absurd\" as an American \"who bafflingly speaks English only with a strong and borderline unintelligible accent and comports herself with torpid model languor at all times\".\nElizabeth Kerr from The Hollywood Reporter felt that Anno and Higuchi had done \"the big guy justice\" and \"created a Godzilla for this era\". While she felt that \"all the telling (or reading) rather than showing reduces the story's overall impact\" Kerr concluded that \"there's an intangible quality to this Godzilla that Edwards (Emmerich doesn't count) never quite captured, and which is always welcome\". Matt Schley from Otaku USA called the film \"A match made in kaiju-heaven\", and praised Anno's directing: \"It's also a reminder, after years in the Evangelion reboot woods, that Anno is one of Japan's most unique directorial voices in either animation or live-action filmmaking.\" Though he felt the special effects weren't as impressive as 2014's Godzilla, Schley stated that the film's CG \"gets the job done, though there are a couple questionable shots\" and concluded by stating that \"Hideaki Anno has achieved a successful resurgence for both the Big G and himself\".\n\nAccolades\nPost\u2013release\nFurther films and proposed sequel\nIn July 2017, while attending the American fan convention G-Fest, Higuchi confirmed that Toho could not produce another Godzilla film until after 2020. This was due to Toho's contract with Legendary Entertainment, who were producing their own Godzilla films, that restricts Toho from releasing their Godzilla films in the same year as Legendary's Godzilla films; Legendary released Godzilla: King of the Monsters in 2019, originally slated for 2018, and Godzilla vs. Kong in 2021, originally slated for 2020. At the time, Higuchi noted that Legendary's contract was effective until 2020. In May 2018, Toho announced that it would not make a sequel to Shin Godzilla, but expressed interest in a potential shared universe series, akin to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, featuring Toho's monsters.\nDespite not producing a direct sequel, Toho released a trilogy of anime films: Godzilla: Planet of the Monsters (2017), Godzilla: City on the Edge of Battle (2018), and Godzilla: The Planet Eater (2018); an anime series, Godzilla Singular Point (2021); and another live-action film, Godzilla Minus One (2023).\nIn 2022, Hideaki Anno revealed that he had planned to create a sequel to the film, stating that \"I wrote a proposal during the filming of Shin Godzilla on February 3, 2016, labeled Sequel Shin Godzilla Memo. The primary working title for the project was Shin Godzilla's Counterattack (\u30b7\u30f3\u30fb\u30b4\u30b8\u30e9\u306e\u53cd\u6483, Shin Gojira no Hangeki) and with the assumption that Mr. Higuchi would direct, it was meant to be something like a Toho Champion Festival kaiju showdown. Since it was concocted to be released in 2018, the shortest time possible for a domestic-made Godzilla film to be released, it was a rough draft for people who wouldn't like Shin Godzilla, an idea that wouldn't cost too much or take too long to create. I believed that it would be a bad idea to let it go to waste so I gave the proposal, draft, and visuals, as a gift to Mr. Higuchi and Toho, but since it was premature or whatever, among other reasons, after the film's release the discussion ended. While I did feel it was a waste, it's not something I could help since Toho decides what gets made.\"\n\nCollaborative projects\nIn 2016, Toho and Khara, Inc. collaborated on Godzilla vs. Evangelion, a cross-over line of merchandise uniting Shin Godzilla and Anno's Neon Genesis Evangelion. In May 2019, Universal Studios Japan opened the Godzilla vs. Evangelion: The Real 4D attraction. It ran until August 2019. In February 2022, Toho, Khara, Toei Company, and Tsuburaya Productions announced a collaborative project titled Shin Japan Heroes Universe for merchandise, special events and tie-ins. The project unites films that Anno had worked on that bear the katakana title \"Shin\" (\u30b7\u30f3), such as Shin Godzilla, Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon a Time, Shin Ultraman and Shin Kamen Rider.\n\nPublic attractions\nIn 2017, Universal Studios Japan featured a temporary 4D Shin Godzilla attraction as part of its Universal Cool Japan 2017 program. In 2018, a statue of the film's version of Godzilla was erected in central Tokyo. The area was dubbed Hibiya Godzilla Square and is considered to be largest Godzilla statue in Japan, according to Toho. In October 2020, Nijigen no Mori opened a Shin Godzilla zip line attraction in Kobe, Japan.\n\nSee also\n2016 in science fiction\nShin Ultraman (2022)\nShin Kamen Rider (2023)\n\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\nAnno, Hideaki (May 13, 2022). \"Shin Ultraman's memoir Hideaki Anno\".

A frequent collaborator of Akira Kurosawa, he wrote the scripts for such internationally acclaimed films as Rashomon and Seven Samurai.\n\nEarly life\nShinobu Hashimoto was born in the Hyogo Prefecture of Japan on 18 April 1918. In 1938 he enlisted in the army, but became ill with tuberculosis while still training and spent four years in a veterans' sanitarium.\n\nCareer\nWhile hospitalized, another patient gave Hashimoto a film magazine. The magazine sparked his interest in screenwriting and he began a screenplay about his army experience, spending three years on the project.\nHashimoto was a frequent collaborator with Akira Kurosawa, from 1950 to 1970 writing eight screenplays Kurosawa directed. He often worked with Hideo Oguni, Ry\u016bz\u014d Kikushima as well as Kurosawa himself on the scripts for those projects. Hashimoto won numerous awards for his writing, including a succession of Blue Ribbon Awards and Mainichi Film Awards, particularly in the 1950s and 1960s. Hashimoto wrote more than eighty screenplays, including Rashomon, Ikiru, Seven Samurai (1950), Throne of Blood (a 1957 adaptation of Macbeth set in Japan), and The Hidden Fortress (1958). He also directed three films.\nAchieving international acclaim, Hashimoto's scripts inspired notable films abroad, including The Magnificent Seven (1960 and then remade again in 2016), a remake of Seven Samurai, and Star Wars (1977), which George Lucas has described as inspired by The Hidden Fortress.\nIn 2006, he authored a memoir entitled Compound Cinematics: Akira Kurosawa and I. In 2008, Hashimoto wrote a screenplay for I Want to Be a Shellfish, a second full-length film adaptation of the post-World War II-based television series he wrote for Tokyo Broadcasting System Television in 1958.\n\nLater life and death\nHashimoto turned 100 in April 2018. He died in Tokyo on 19 July 2018 at the age of 100. In a tribute article for TIME magazine, film director Antoine Fuqua expressed his respect for Hashimoto as a screenwriter stating: \"(Hashimoto's) \u2026 working with Akira Kurosawa and Hideo Oguni, was so beautiful and poetic and powerful and heartbreaking. It was all about justice, it was all about sacrifice, and it made me want to be one of those guys\".\n\nAwards and honors\n1950: Blue Ribbon Award for Best Screenplay for Rashomon\n1952: Mainichi Film Award for Best Screenplay for Ikiru\n1956: Mainichi Film Award for Best Screenplay for Mahiru no ankoku\n1956: Blue Ribbon Awards for Best Screenplay for Mahiru no ankoku\n1958: Mainichi Film Award for Best Screenplay for Summer Clouds, Stakeout and Night Drum\n1958: Blue Ribbon Awards for Best Screenplay for Summer Clouds and Stakeout\n1958: Kinema Junpo's Best Screenwriter Award for The Hidden Fortress\n1960: Mainichi Film Award for Best Screenplay for Black Art Book (ja:\u9ed2\u3044\u753b\u96c6)\n1962: Blue Ribbon Award for Best Screenplay for Harakiri\n1966: Mainichi Film Award for Best Screenplay for Shiroi Kyot\u014d\n1974: Mainichi Film Award for Best Screenplay for Castle of Sand\n2015: Mainichi Film Award Special Prize for screenwriting\n\nFilmography\nHashimoto is credited in the making of at least 85 films.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nShinobu Hashimoto at IMDb","172":"Shiroi Kyot\u014d (\u767d\u3044\u5de8\u5854, literally \"The White Tower\") is a 1965 novel by Toyoko Yamasaki.

The Never-setting Sun) is a 2009 Japanese film directed by Setsur\u014d Wakamatsu. It is also known as The Unbroken in the United States.\nShizumanu Taiy\u014d is based on a novel by Toyoko Yamasaki which centers on Hajime Onchi, an employee of \"NAL,\" a large national airline. The first part of the novel focuses on Onchi's activity as the chairman of the employees' union in the 1960s; his reward for fighting for better working conditions for the staff is a series of postings abroad, to Pakistan, Iran, and finally Kenya, a destination to which the company does not even fly. The second and third parts of the novel take place in 1985 and chronicle the crash of a jumbo jet and its aftermath within the company.\nThe events portrayed in the story are based upon actual events that took place at Japan Airlines. The character of Onchi is based upon JAL labor organizer and author Hirotaro Ogura, and the pivotal crash portrayed in the novel is based closely upon the crash of Japan Airlines Flight 123 (up to having the same flight number and taking place at the same location, date and time). Several politicians and JAL executives portrayed in the story are also based on real-world counterparts. JAL objected strongly to both the novel and the film, stating that they were defamatory to the airline and disrespected the victims of the actual Flight 123. The novel claims to be a work based upon real-life events, while the film claims to be entirely a work of fiction.\nThe cast of the film includes Ken Watanabe as Onchi, with K\u014dji Ishizaka, Ky\u014dko Suzuki, Yasuko Matsuyuki and Tomokazu Miura in supporting roles. The violininst Diana Yukawa, whose father died in the real-world crash of JAL Flight 123, was involved in the music for the film.\nThe premiere was on 24 October 2009 in Ginza. Yukawa performed \"Little Prayer\", the track she recorded for the film.\n\nAwards and nominations\n34th Hochi Film Award\n\nWon: Best Film\nWon: Best Actor - Ken Watanabe\n33rd Japan Academy Prize\n\nWon: Best Film\nWon: Best Actor - Ken Watanabe\n\nCast\nKen Watanabe as Hajime Onchi\nTomokazu Miura as Shiro Gyoten\nTeruyuki Kagawa as Kazuo Yagi\nKy\u014dka Suzuki as Ritsuko Onchi\nErika Toda as Junko Onchi\nGo Kato as the prime minister Yasushi Tonegawa (based on Yasuhiro Nakasone)\nNenji Kobayashi as the deputy prime minister Takemaru (based on Shin Kanemaru)\nT\u014dru Shinagawa as Issei Ryuzaki (based on Ry\u016bz\u014d Sejima)\nK\u014dji Ishizaka as Masayuki Kunimi\nTae Kimura as Natsuko Suzuki\nYasuko Matsuyuki as Miki Mitsui\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nShizumanu Taiy\u014d at IMDb","174":"Shoplifters (Japanese: \u4e07\u5f15\u304d\u5bb6\u65cf, romanized: Manbiki Kazoku, lit.\u2009'Shoplifting Family') is a 2018 Japanese drama film written, directed and edited by Hirokazu Kore-eda. Starring Lily Franky and Sakura Ando, it is about a family that relies on shoplifting to cope with a life of poverty.\nKore-eda wrote the screenplay contemplating what makes a family, inspired by reports on poverty and shoplifting in Japan. Principal photography began in mid-December 2017.\nShoplifters premiered on 13 May 2018 at the Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Palme d'Or. The film was released in Japan on 8 June 2018 and was a critical and commercial success. Shoplifters won three Mainichi Film Awards, including Best Film, and the Asia Pacific Screen Award for Best Feature Film, and was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars and the Golden Globes.\n\nPlot\nIn Tokyo, a family lives together in poverty: Hatsue, an elderly woman who owns the home and supports them with her deceased husband's pension; Nobuyo, who works for an industrial laundry service; her husband Osamu, a day laborer forced to leave his job after twisting his ankle; Aki, who works at a fetish club; and Shota, a young boy.\nOsamu and Shota routinely shoplift from stores, using a system of hand signals to communicate. Osamu tells Shota it is fine to steal things that have not been sold, as they do not belong to anyone. One cold night, they see Yuri, a neighborhood girl they regularly observe locked out on an apartment balcony, and bring her home with them. They only intend to have her stay for dinner, but after finding evidence of abuse, they choose not to return her.\nYuri bonds with her new family and learns to shoplift from Osamu and Shota. Osamu urges Shota to see him as his father and Yuri as his sister, but Shota is reluctant. The family learns on television that after almost two months, police are investigating Yuri's disappearance; her parents never reported her missing. The family cuts her hair, burns her old clothes, and renames her Lin.\nHatsue visits her husband's son from an affair, from whom she regularly receives money. The son and his wife are Aki's parents; they lie that their daughter is living in Australia. The family visits the beach, and Hatsue expresses contentment that she will not die a lonely death. At home that night, she dies in her sleep. Osamu and Nobuyo bury her under the house in order to avoid reporting her death and continue to collect her pension.\nOsamu steals a purse from a car, making Shota feel uneasy since he considers this theft against their moral code. Shota recalls joining the family after Nobuyo and Osamu found him in a locked car. Increasingly guilt-ridden about teaching Yuri to steal, Shota interrupts her theft by stealing fruit from a grocery store in view of the staff. Cornered, he jumps from a bridge and breaks his leg.\nShota is hospitalized and detained by police. Nobuyo and Osamu are caught after attempting to flee with Yuri and Aki. The authorities discover Yuri and the death of Hatsue and tell Shota that the family was going to abandon him. They reveal to Aki that Nobuyo and Osamu previously killed Nobuyo's abusive husband in a crime of passion, and that Hatsue was receiving money from Aki's parents.\nNobuyo takes the blame for the crimes to protect Osamu, who has a previous criminal record, and is sentenced to prison. Shota is placed in an orphanage. Osamu and Shota visit Nobuyo in prison, and she gives Shota details of the car they found him in so he can search for his parents. Shota stays overnight with Osamu, against the orphanage's rules. When Shota asks, Osamu tells him the truth, confirming that they intended to abandon him, and says he can no longer be his father.\nThe next morning, as he is about to depart, Shota says that he allowed himself to be caught. Osamu runs after Shota's bus; Shota looks back and finally acknowledges Osamu as his father. Yuri is returned to her parents, who continue to neglect her, and looks wistfully back at the house she shared with the family.\n\nCast\nProduction\nDirector Hirokazu Kore-eda said that he developed the story for Shoplifters when considering his earlier film Like Father, Like Son, with the question \"What makes a family?\" He had been considering a film exploring this question for 10 years before making Shoplifters. Kore-eda described it as his \"socially conscious\" film. With this story, Kore-eda said he did not want the perspective to be from only a few individual characters, but to capture \"the family within the society\", a \"wide point of view\" in the vein of his 2004 film Nobody Knows. He set his story in Tokyo and was also influenced by the Japanese Recession, including media reports of how people lived in poverty and of shoplifting. To research the project, Kore-eda toured an orphanage and wrote a scene inspired by a girl there who read from Swimmy by Leo Lionni. Kore-eda said,\n\nWhen I visited an orphanage, a little girl took the picture book Swimmy out of her backpack and suddenly started to read it. The staff tried to stop her, telling her she was bothering us, but she read it to the end. Everyone, including the staff, was moved and applauded her. She looked so happy. I thought she really wanted to read that book to her parents. I couldn\u2019t get her out of my head and wrote a scene reflecting that moment.\nWhen I was working in TV, a senpai (senior) told me that I should make my program for one person, be it my mother or a friend or anyone. \u2026 I made this film for the little girl I\u2019d heard reading Swimmy.\n\nLily Franky and Sakura Ando joined the cast before principal photography began in mid-December 2017. Child actors Sasaki Miyu and Jyo Kairi were cast for their first film. Sosuke Ikematsu, Chizuru Ikewaki and Y\u016bki Yamada joined the cast in February.  It was also one of the last films Kirin Kiki appeared in before her death in 2018.\nProduction began in December 2017, with Fuji Television Network, Gaga, and AOI Pro producing.  Cinematographer Kondo Ryuto used 35 mm film with an Arricam ST, aware 35 mm was a preference of Kore-eda's and also seeking the right texture and grain for the story.\n\nRelease\nWith Gaga Corporation as its distributor, the film was selected to screen at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival, where it went on to win the Palme d'Or. In Japan, it was scheduled for release on 8 June 2018. Magnolia Pictures also obtained the rights to distribute the film in North America. On 23 May 2018, Thunderbird Releasing acquired the UK distribution rights, while Road Pictures secured the rights to distribute it in China.\n\nReception\nBox office\nThe film grossed \u00a54.55 billion ($37.8 million) in Japan by the end of 2018, making it the fourth highest-grossing domestic film of the year and the second highest-grossing Japanese live-action film of the year (after Code Blue). In China, the film grossed $14 million, in what The Hollywood Reporter called \"an unprecedentedly strong performance for an imported pure arthouse drama\". Shoplifters also grossed $3,313,513 in the United States and Canada, and $17,398,743 in other territories, for a worldwide total of $72,625,772. This makes it the most successful commercially of the five nominees for the 2019 Academy Award for Best International Film.It scored China Box Office Record.\nIn its tenth weekend of release in the United States and Canada, following its Oscar nomination, the film made $190,000 from 114 theaters, for a running total of $2.5 million up until then.\n\nHome media\nIn the United Kingdom, it was 2019's fourth best-selling foreign language film on home video, below the Hayao Miyazaki anime films Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro and Princess Mononoke.\n\nCritical response\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating 99% based on 229 reviews, with an average rating of 8.8\/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Understated yet ultimately deeply affecting, Shoplifters adds another powerful chapter to director Hirokazu Kore-eda's richly humanistic filmography.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 93 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Shoplifters was also listed on numerous critics' top ten lists for 2018.\nPeter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave Shoplifters 4\/5 stars, declaring it a \"rich, satisfying film\", but subsequently upgraded this to a 5\/5 star review upon second viewing. The Guardian later ranked the film 15th in its Best Films of the 21st Century list. The Hollywood Reporter critic Deborah Young called it \"bittersweet\" as it \"contrasts the frigid emotions of socially correct behavior with the warmth and happiness of a dishonest lower-class family\". Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph awarded it five stars, hailing it as an \"outstanding domestic drama, crafted by Kore-eda with crystalline insight and an unsparing emotional acuity\".\nFor IndieWire, David Ehrlich gave it a grade of \"A\u2212\" and wrote the film \"stings\" with \"the loneliness of not belonging to anyone, and the messiness of sticking together\". TheWrap's Ben Croll declared it Kore-eda's \"richest film to date\". In Time Out, Geoff Andrew gave it four stars and saluted Kore-eda as \"a modern-day Ozu\". Variety's Maggie Lee also compared it to Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens; Lily Franky's character Osamu was likewise compared to Dickens's character Fagin.\nIn Japan, The Japan Times gave Shoplifters five stars, writing \"The cheers are entirely deserved\" and credited it for an \"outwardly naturalistic\" style.\n\nAccolades\nThe film competed at the Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Palme d'Or on 19 May. It was the first Japanese Palme d'Or-winner since The Eel in 1997. Jury president Cate Blanchett explained the decision: \"We were completely bowled over by Shoplifters. How intermeshed the performances were with the directorial vision\". In July 2018, Shoplifters also won Best International Film at the Munich Film Festival, with the jury citing it by stating it \"opens up new possibilities and ultimately offers [...] hope\".\nIn August, Shoplifters was selected as the Japanese entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 91st Academy Awards. It made the December shortlist in 2018, before being nominated for the Academy Award in January 2019.\n\nSee also\nList of submissions to the 91st Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film\nList of Japanese submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film\nParasite, a 2019 South Korean film directed by Bong Joon-ho about the wealth gap and class divide in an East Asian country.

Since 1952, it has conducted the well-known decennial Sight and Sound Poll of the Greatest Films of All Time.\n\nHistory and content\nSight and Sound was first published in Spring 1932 as \"A quarterly review of modern aids to learning published under the auspices of the British Institute of Adult Education\". In 1934, management of the magazine was handed to the nascent British Film Institute (BFI), which still publishes the magazine today. Sight and Sound was published quarterly for most of its history until the early 1990s, apart from a brief run as a monthly publication in the early 1950s, but in 1991 it merged with another BFI publication, the Monthly Film Bulletin, and started to appear monthly.\nIn 1949, Gavin Lambert, co-founder of film journal Sequence, was hired as the editor, and also brought with him Sequence editor Penelope Houston as assistant editor as well as co-founders and future film directors Lindsay Anderson and Karel Reisz. Lambert edited the journal until 1956, with Houston taking over as editor until 1990. Philip Dodd became the editor following the merging of Monthly Film Bulletin with Nick James taking over in 1997. James was editor until August 2019. It is currently edited by Mike Williams. The magazine reviews all film releases each month, including those with a limited (art house) release, as opposed to most film magazines which concentrate on those films with a general release.\nSight and Sound has in the past been the subject of criticism, notably from Raymond Durgnat, who often accused it of elitism, puritanism and snobbery, although he did write for it in the 1950s, and again in the 1990s. Until 2020, the magazine's American counterpart was Film Comment, a magazine that was published by the Film Society of Lincoln Center in New York City.\n\nThe Sight and Sound Poll of the Greatest Films of All Time\nSince 1952, Sight and Sound has conducted a decennial poll to determine the greatest films of all time. Until 1992, the votes of the invited critics and directors were compiled in one list;, since 1992, directors have been invited to participate in separate poll.\nThe Sight and Sound poll has come to be regarded as the most important of the \"greatest ever film\" lists. The critic Roger Ebert described it as \"by far the most respected of the countless polls of great movies\u2014the only one most serious movie people take seriously.\"\nSight and Sound first ran the poll in 1952 following publication earlier in the year of a list of the Top Ten Films, headed by Battleship Potemkin, based on a poll of mostly directors conducted by the committee of the Festival Mondial du Film et des Beaux-Arts de Belgique. Following publication of that poll, Sight and Sound decided to poll film critics for their choices and announced the results in their next issue. 85 critics from Britain, France, the United States, Italy, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Belgium, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia were asked but only 63 responded including Lindsay Anderson, Lotte H. Eisner, Curtis Harrington, Henri Langlois, Friedrich Luft, Claude Mauriac, Dilys Powell, Jean Queval, Terry Ramsaye, Karel Reisz, G. W. Stonier (under the name William Whitebait) and Archer Winsten. Most critics found the question unfair. The first poll was topped by Bicycle Thieves with 25 out of 63 votes and contained six silent films. The five subsequent polls (1962\u20132002) were won by Citizen Kane (which finished 13th in 1952).\nFor the 2012 poll, Sight and Sound listened to decades of criticism about the lack of diversity of its poll participants and made a huge effort to invite a much wider variety of critics and filmmakers from around the world to participate, taking into account gender, ethnicity, race, geographical region, socioeconomic status, and other kinds of underrepresentation. The list of people polled for the critics' poll expanded significantly from 145 to 846 and also included programmers, curators, archivists, film historians and other academics for the first time. Following the change, Citizen Kane only received the second highest number of votes, with Vertigo receiving the most. The directors' poll also expanded from 108 to 358 directors and Tokyo Story received the most votes with Citizen Kane receiving the joint second-most together with 2001: A Space Odyssey.\nIn 2022, the number of people polled for the critics' poll increased even further from 846 to 1,639 and Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles received the most votes, the first film to be directed by a woman to top the list. Vertigo received the second most and Citizen Kane third. Nearly 4,000 different films received at least one mention. 2001: A Space Odyssey topped the directors' poll for the first time in 2022 with Citizen Kane in second place and Tokyo Story in joint fourth together with Jeanne Dielman. Among the directors that participated were Julie Dash, Barry Jenkins, Lynne Ramsay, Martin Scorsese and Apichatpong Weerasethakul.\nLa R\u00e8gle du Jeu (The Rules of the Game) appeared in the first seven of the magazine's decennial polls; Citizen Kane has appeared in the last seven.\n\nCritics' Top Ten Poll\n1952\nBicycle Thieves (25 mentions)\n(tie) City Lights and The Gold Rush (19 mentions)\nBattleship Potemkin (16 mentions)\n(tie) Intolerance and Louisiana Story (12 mentions)\n(tie) Greed, The Passion of Joan of Arc and Le Jour Se L\u00e8ve (11 mentions)\n(tie) Le Million, The Rules of the Game and Brief Encounter (10 mentions)\nClosest runners-up: Citizen Kane, La Grande Illusion, and The Grapes of Wrath.

It stars Tetsur\u014d Tamba, Mako, Eiji Okada, and Shima Iwashita alongside English actors David Lampson and Don Kenny. Endo co-wrote the screenplay with Masahiro Shinoda. Most of the film's dialogue is in Japanese, though it has short sequences in English. It was entered Un Certain Regard into the 1972 Cannes Film Festival, and won four Mainichi Film Awards including Best Film and Best Director.\nThe film's themes analyze the conflict of human nature versus divine requirements and their compatibility, life's purpose, the interplay of emotional needs, suffering, and contentment. The storytelling device the film uses is circumstantial and depicts the struggles of life, allegorical presentation, and Christian theology. It is the first of three movie adaptations of the novel, succeeded by the Portuguese Os Olhos da \u00c1sia in 1996 and the 2016 American film of the same name.\n\nPlot\nIn the 17th century, two Portuguese Jesuit priests, Rodrigo and Garupe, travel to Japan to proselytize despite a formal ban on the practice or promotion of Christianity. They also search for their mentor Ferreira, with whom they lost contact five years prior and presume is imprisoned. Rodrigo is patronizing and Garupe is cautious. The two priests are overwhelmed with the welcome they receive from the persecuted Japanese Christians, but occasionally wish for some comfort food from home.\nThey travel to the village of Kichijiro, the fisherman who smuggled them into Japan from China. Returning, they learn that a detachment of Japanese officials and samurai have arrived to search for them. With most of their flock taken into custody or tortured for refusing to betray them, the two priests decide to leave but they become separated. Kichijiro finds Rodrigo and joins with him; he confesses to Rodrigo he is a weak man, and that his family was slaughtered for being Christians. Nagasaki Magistrate Inoue's men capture Rodrigo and throw 300 pieces of silver at Kichijiro (reminiscent of Judas Iscariot). He later gives away the money to a prostitute for emotional support.\nInoue takes Rodrigo to Nagasaki and puts him on trial. Later, he and other prisoners are forced to watch as a Christian samurai family are publicly humiliated and threatened for practicing Christianity; the wife, Kiku, recants, and the husband is put to death for his defiance. Kichijiro, guilt-ridden for his treachery, sneaks into the holding cell, asks Rodrigo to forgive him. He says he betrayed Rodrigo because everyone shamed him for recanting his faith and so he despises anyone who reminds him of it.\nInoue, through his interpreter, invites Rodrigo for a talk in private. Inoue says the Catholic Church is unwanted in Japan, comparing Rodrigo's faith to a concubine who makes trouble for a man's conscience. Rodrigo says the truth of the Church is universal and as the happiness between a man and woman is disturbed, the State disturbs the efforts of the Church to spread its teachings of peace and brotherhood. Each accuses the other of ignorance, but Inoue is eventually swayed somewhat by Rodrigo's conviction. Nonetheless, he is bound by the shogun's law to ban Christianity.\nLater Rodrigo is taken to the seaside and sees Garupe, who has been taken prisoner along with his Japanese companions. The interpreter tells Rodrigo that Inoue wants him to witness Garupe apostatizing his faith; if he fails to do so, the Japanese converts will be killed. While Garupe's companions are drowned one by one, the priest defies his captors, frees himself, and jumps into the sea. He tries to pull the drowning victims to safety but is stabbed at by spear-wielding samurai and slowly loses his strength until he drowns as well.\nLater, Rodrigo is taken to a Buddhist temple to visit Inoue's friend, Lord Chuan Sawano. Sawano turns out to be Ferreira, who has apostatized and is working under Inoue as an astronomy scholar, tasked with exposing errors and inconsistencies in the Bible and other Christian writings. Sawano advises his former student to renounce the Church and Christianity; Rodrigo rebukes him. Sawano says he preached in Japan for twenty years, and he knows this is not a land where Christianity can be rooted but a terrifying swamp where seedlings can rot and die and the inculturation of Christianity is the worst. Rodrigo rejects all these claims and censures him by saying that this wouldn't be the attitude of Saint Xavier.\nRodrigo is then hung upside down in a pit with a small incision at the back of his ear for the blood to drip slowly. Sawano visits him and explains that three newly recanted Christian believers have been hung upside down next to him for the past six hours. Sawano says he was in the same cell where Rodrigo is now and was hung for two days and there were five men who were hung in the pit, and he can still hear their voices. The former priest admits that the real reason he renounced his faith was not because of the torture, but the absence of God in others' suffering. Rodrigo replies those who are in suffering will receive eternal happiness for their pain. Sawano mocks him, and notes that if Rodrigo sacrifices his faith for the sake of love, the other three men will be spared and given medical treatment.\nThe interpreter comes with a fumi-e and encourages Rodrigo to step on it as Sawano watches and chants silently. Rodrigo steps on the fumi-e and a rooster crows twice (reminiscent of Saint Peter's denial). Later, a complacent Rodrigo is shown helping Inoue's officers to identify forbidden Christian objects being smuggled in by foreign ships. Rodrigo is asked to comment on a cup, and he says it's not a chalice because the stem would have been longer. He eventually becomes a samurai and is given Kiku as his wife; from that day forward, he is given her dead husband's name Sanemon Okada as Ferreira was given the title of Lord Sawano. A happy Kichijiro is shown sweeping the surroundings.\n\nCast\nDavid Lampson as Sebastian Rodrigo\nDon Kenny as Francisco Garupe\nTetsur\u014d Tamba as Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o Ferreira\nMako Iwamatsu as Kichijiro\nRokko Toura as The Interpreter\nEiji Okada as Inoue\nYoshi Kat\u014d as Old Man\nNoboru Matsuhashi as Mokichi\nShima Iwashita as Kiku\nY\u00fbsuke Takita as Ichizo\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nSilence at IMDb","177":"Sisters of the Gion (Japanese: \u7947\u5712\u306e\u59c9\u59b9, Hepburn: Gion no ky\u014ddai) or Sisters of Gion is a 1936 black and white Japanese drama film directed by Kenji Mizoguchi about two geisha sisters living in Kyoto's Gion district. It forms a diptych with Mizoguchi's Osaka Elegy which shares much of the same cast and production team.\n\nPlot\nThe story centers around two geisha sisters, Umekichi and Omocha, who live in their own lodging house (okiya) in the licensed pleasure district of Gion, Kyoto. The two women have very different outlooks on relationships with men. Umekichi, the elder sister, underwent classical geisha training and wears kimono, and has a strong sense of loyalty (giri) to her patron. Umekichi's younger sister, Omocha, was educated in public schools and wears western clothing, except when she is working as a geisha. Unlike Umekichi, Omocha doesn\u2019t trust men and believes that they will only use geisha and then abandon them without a care. Thus, she uses men to her own advantage, willing to manipulate and lie to her customers.\nUmekichi's patron is a newly bankrupt businessman named Shimbei Furusawa, who Umekichi takes care of after he loses his house and business. Omocha does not believe that her sister should support Shimbei, that doing so will prevent her from providing for herself by finding a new patron, and that she owes him nothing as, in her view, he has received more than he has given in the past. Omocha finds her sister a new patron and, one day when Umekichi is out, gives Shimbei some money to return to his wife in the country and tells him that her sister no longer wants him around. He takes the money but, rather than leaving, spends it drinking and takes up residence with his former clerk.\nOmocha also attempts to find a patron for herself and appears to be successful in gaining the attention of the owner of a clothing shop. However, in the process of helping her sister, Omocha has previously taken advantage of the owner's clerk, who has stolen from the shop to provide a kimono for Umekichi and been found out.\nUmekichi throws over her new patron when she learns from the kimono shop clerk of Omocha's deception of Shimbei, and returns to him. The clerk is discovered at Omocha's okiya by the shop owner and dismissed. He seeks revenge on his former employer by informing his wife of her husband's infidelity, and then exacts his revenge on Omocha by abducting her in a car and later throwing her out of it.\nUltimately, both Omocha and Umekichi are defeated at the end of the film. Umekichi is abandoned by her patron Shimbei when he is given the chance to manage a factory in the country where his wife has retired, and she ends up caring for Omocha after her hospitalization for her injuries. Bandaged and confined to her hospital bed, Omocha curses the geisha system and the sexual subjugation involved.\n\nCast\nIsuzu Yamada as younger sister Omocha\nY\u014dko Umemura as older sister Umekichi\nBenkei Shiganoya as Shimbei Furusawa\nFumio Okura as Jurakudo\nEitar\u014d Shind\u014d as Kudo\nTaiz\u014d Fukami as Kimura\nSakurako Iwama as Omasa Kud\u014d\nNamiko Kawajima\nReiko Aoi\nShizuko Takizawa\n\nLegacy\nCritic Tadashi Iijima considered Sisters of the Gion to be \"the best prewar sound film\". In the British Film Institute's \"Best Japanese film of every year\" list, film historian Alexander Jacoby observed that Mizoguchi \"delivered his social analysis with concision, force, rigour and scalpel-like precision\". Mizoguchi himself named this film and its companion piece Osaka Elegy as the works with which he achieved artistic maturity.\nA remake of the same name directed by Hiromasa Nomura was released in 1956. Film historian Donald Richie also saw strong similarities between Mizoguchi's film and K\u014dzabur\u014d Yoshimura's 1951 geisha drama  Clothes of Deception.\n\nAwards\nThe film won the 1937 Kinema Junpo Award for best film (director Kenji Mizoguchi).\n\nNote on the running time\nReferences\nExternal links\nSisters of the Gion at IMDb\nhttp:\/\/www.talkingpix.co.uk\/ReviewsSisterofG.html","178":"Slant Magazine is an American online publication that features reviews of movies, music, TV, DVDs, theater, and video games, as well as interviews with actors, directors, and musicians.

It was Kurosawa's second film of 1949 produced by the Film Art Association and released by Shintoho. It is also considered a detective movie (among the earliest Japanese films in that genre) that explores the mood of Japan during its painful postwar recovery. The film is also considered a precursor to the contemporary police procedural and buddy cop film genres, based on its premise of pairing two cops with different personalities and motivations together on a difficult case.\n\nPlot\nThe film takes place during a heatwave in the middle of summer in post-war Tokyo. Murakami (Toshiro Mifune), a newly-promoted homicide detective in the Tokyo police, has his Colt pistol stolen while riding on a crowded trolley. He chases the pickpocket, but loses him. A remorseful Murakami reports the theft to his superior, Nakajima, at police headquarters. After Nakajima encourages him to conduct an investigation into the theft, the inexperienced Murakami gets a lead from one of the ladies who traveled in the trolley and goes undercover in the city's backstreets for days, trying to infiltrate the illicit arms market. He eventually locates a dealer who agrees to sell him a stolen gun, but when Murakami arrests the dealer's girlfriend at the exchange, he is distraught to find that she doesn't know anything about his missing gun.  \nWith the aid of a self-missed test fired bullet retrieved in a tree trunk by Murakami, the police forensic firearms expert determines that Murakami's Colt was used to mug a woman of \u00a540,000. Nakajima partners him up with veteran detective Sat\u014d (Takashi Shimura). After Sat\u014d skillfully questions the girlfriend, the two detectives learn that the gun dealer Tachibana, who is using the alias of 'Honda', is a fan of baseball. They stake-out a local high-attendance baseball game looking for Tachibana and manage to lure him away from the crowd before taking him into custody. A rice ration card found on his person reveals that the gun was loaned to Yusa, a disenchanted war veteran who has become involved with the yakuza to support himself. The detectives interview Yusa's sister, one of his yakuza associates, and his sweetheart, showgirl Harumi Namiki (Keiko Awaji); but none of these visits produce any useful leads. Sat\u014d takes Murakami to eat at his place, where he meets Sat\u014d's wife and children. \nMurakami's gun is used again, this time to murder another woman during a robbery. He and Sat\u014d continue to question Namiki at her mother's house. She is still reluctant to talk, so Sat\u014d leaves to trace Yusa's movements, while Murakami remains behind hoping that Namiki's mother can persuade her to begin cooperating. Sat\u014d finds the hotel where Yusa is staying. He tries to call Murakami, but just as he is about to reveal Yusa's location, the criminal (having overheard the hotel owners mention that a cop is present) shoots Sat\u014d twice before making his escape. Sat\u014d, badly wounded but alive, staggers out the door, passes out from blood loss, and is taken to the hospital. A distraught Murakami is forcibly removed from the hospital on Nakajima's orders when he becomes disruptive and starts wailing loudly. \nThe following morning, Namiki has a change of heart and informs Murakami that Yusa called and asked her to meet him at a train station so they can skip town. Murakami races to the station and manages to get a positive identification on Yusa by taking into account his age, white suit stained with mud, and left-handedness, three tips he has collected over the past few days. Yusa tries to flee and Murakami pursues him into the forest; Yusa is able to wound him in the arm, but then panics, wastes his last two bullets, and throws the gun away. Murakami, in spite of his injury, wrestles Yusa down, handcuffs him, retrieves the gun, and takes him into custody. Days later at the hospital, Sat\u014d has recovered and congratulates Murakami on receiving his first citation. Murakami admits that he sympathizes with Yusa's situation, to which Sat\u014d replies that there are lots more like Yusa and that he will lose such sentimentality over time as he arrests more people.\n\nCast\nProduction\nKurosawa mentioned in several interviews that his script was inspired by Jules Dassin\u2019s The Naked City and the works of Georges Simenon.  Stray Dog was the first time that Kurosawa collaborated with Ryuzo Kikushima, with the former sending the latter to the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department to collect cases that they could use as the basis for the script of the film, choosing a case where a young detective lost his pistol. It also takes inspiration from contemporary debates in Japan about the \"apr\u00e8s-guerre\" generation with its apparent rise in delinquency and crime. Despite being one of Akira Kurosawa's most critically renowned postwar films, Stray Dog was not always held in such high regard by the director himself. Kurosawa initially said that he thought little of the film, calling it \"too technical\" and also remarking that it contains \"all that technique and not one real thought in it.\" His attitude had changed by 1982, when he wrote in his autobiography that \"no shooting ever went as smoothly,\" and that \"the excellent pace of the shooting and the good feeling of the crew can be sensed in the finished film.\" However, Kurosawa was rankled when someone from the ASPCA accused him of infecting a dog with rabies for the movie's opening shot of a canine panting in the heat. He had to write a letter to American occupation officials denying the allegation, and he later said that he never felt \"a stronger sense of regret over Japan's losing the war.\"\nStray Dog was mostly shot at a studio rented by Toho with more than thirty sets built. Ishir\u014d Honda, who would go on to direct several monster movies such as Godzilla and Mothra, served as Kurosawa's chief assistant, shooting second unit footage for the 10-minute long sequence of Murakami roaming through Tokyo, and often doubled for Toshiro Mifune in waist shots. Kurosawa later praised Honda for helping him capture the atmosphere of post-World War II Tokyo. The film marks the first appearances of Minoru Chiaki, Noriko Honma and Isao Kimura in a Kurosawa film. Chiaki would go on to appear in ten more movies by the director, Honma played the medium in Rashomon and Kimura played the youngest of the seven samurai in Seven Samurai. The baseball game scene was shot at the actual Korakuen Stadium.\nThe film was also the debut of then sixteen-year old Keiko Awaji, who plays Harumi Namiki, a dancer and the girlfriend of Yusa, the villain of the film. She was chosen over other actresses because of her mean looks. Kurosawa described her as being too spoiled and that she could not cry on cue, and never cast her again in another movie of his. Awaji would later regret her unprofessionalism during filming. Kurosawa became so close with his cast and crew during filming that he remarked later it was difficult for him to break up with them after filming was completed.\n\nRelease\nStray Dog was distributed theatrically by Toho in Japan on 17 October 1949. The film received a theatrical release in the United States by Toho International with English subtitles on August 31, 1963.\n\nReception\nStray Dog holds a 95% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 20 reviews, with an average rating of 7.90\/10. At the 1950 Mainichi Film Concours, it won awards for Best Actor (Takashi Shimura), Best Film Score (Fumio Hayasaka), Best Cinematography (Asakazu Nakai) and Best Art Direction (S\u014d Matsuyama). The film was included on Kinema Junpo's \"Best Ten\" of the year at third place. In 2009, the film was voted at No. 10 on the list of The Greatest Japanese Films of All Time by Japanese film magazine Kinema Junpo.\n\nRemake\nThe film was remade in 1973, under the name Nora inu, for Shochiku. It was later remade for television in 2013.\nAn Indian Tamil film, 8 Thottakkal, was loosely inspired by the film, which was remade in Kannada as 8MM Bullet (2018), Telugu as Senapathi (2021), and Malayalam as Corona Papers (2023).\n\nReferences\nSources\nExternal links\n\nStray Dog at IMDb\nStray Dog at AllMovie\nExcess in Stray Dog an essay by Chris Fujiwara at the Criterion Collection\nStray Dog (in Japanese) at the Japanese Movie Database","180":"Stuart Eugene Galbraith IV (born December 29, 1965) is an American film historian, film critic, essayist, and audio commentator.\n\nEarly life and education\nRaised in Livonia, Michigan, Galbraith first worked professionally as a film reviewer and long-running home video columnist for The Ann Arbor News.

Spirited Away tells the story of Chihiro \"Sen\" Ogino, a ten-year-old girl who, while moving to a new neighborhood, inadvertently enters the world of kami (spirits of Japanese Shinto folklore). After her parents are turned into pigs by the witch Yubaba, Chihiro takes a job working in Yubaba's bathhouse to find a way to free herself and her parents and return to the human world. The film was animated by Studio Ghibli for Tokuma Shoten, Nippon Television Network, Dentsu, Buena Vista Home Entertainment, Tohokushinsha Film, and Mitsubishi and distributed by Toho.\nMiyazaki wrote the screenplay after he decided the film would be based on the ten-year-old daughter of his friend Seiji Okuda, the film's associate producer, who came to visit his house each summer. At the time, Miyazaki was developing two personal projects, but they were rejected. With a budget of US$19 million, production of Spirited Away began in 2000. Pixar animator John Lasseter, a fan and friend of Miyazaki, convinced Walt Disney Pictures to buy the film's North American distribution rights, and served as executive producer of its English-dubbed version. Lasseter then hired Kirk Wise as director and Donald W. Ernst as producer, while screenwriters Cindy and Donald Hewitt wrote the English-language dialogue to match the characters' original Japanese-language lip movements.\nReleased in Japan on 20 July 2001, Spirited Away was widely acclaimed and commercially successful, grossing $395.8 million at the worldwide box office. Accordingly, it became the highest-grossing film in Japanese history with a total of \u00a531.68 billion ($305 million). It held the record for 19 years until it was surpassed by Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba \u2013 The Movie: Mugen Train in 2020.\nSpirited Away was a co-recipient of the Golden Bear with Bloody Sunday at the 2002 Berlin International Film Festival and became the first hand-drawn, Japanese anime and non-English-language animated film to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards. The film is now regarded as one of the greatest films of all time and has been included in various \"best-of\" lists, including ranking fourth on BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century.\n\nPlot\nTen-year-old Chihiro Ogino and her parents are traveling to their new home. Chihiro's father decides to take a shortcut. He stops in front of a tunnel leading to what appears to be an abandoned amusement park, which her mother insists on exploring over Chihiro's protestations. Upon finding a seemingly empty restaurant still stocked with food, Chihiro's parents immediately begin to eat. While exploring further, Chihiro finds an enormous bathhouse and meets a boy named Haku, who warns her to return across the riverbed before sunset. However, Chihiro discovers her parents have been transformed into pigs and she cannot cross the now-flooded river.\nHaku finds Chihiro and instructs her to ask for a job from the bathhouse's boiler-man, Kamaji, a y\u014dkai commanding the susuwatari. Kamaji instead asks a worker named Lin to send Chihiro to Yubaba, the witch who runs the bathhouse and cursed her parents, as well as Haku's master. Yubaba tries to frighten Chihiro away, but eventually gives her a work contract. As Chihiro signs the contract with her name (\u5343\u5c0b), Yubaba takes away the second kanji in her name, renaming her Sen (\u5343). She soon forgets her real name, and Haku later explains that Yubaba controls people by taking their names; if she completely forgets hers like he once did, she will never be able to leave the spirit world.\nThe other workers, except for Kamaji and Lin, frequently mocked Sen. While working, she invites a silent creature named No-Face inside, believing him to be a customer. The spirit of a polluted river arrives as Sen's first customer. After she cleans him, he gives her a magic emetic dumpling as a token of gratitude. Meanwhile, No-Face demands food from the bathhouse workers, granting gold copied from the river spirit in exchange. However, when Sen declines the gold and leaves, he angrily swallows some workers.\nSen sees paper shikigami attacking a dragon and recognizes the dragon as Haku metamorphosed. When the seriously injured Haku crashes into Yubaba's penthouse, Sen follows him upstairs. A shikigami that stowed away on her back shapeshifts into Yubaba's twin sister Zeniba, who turns Yubaba's son, Boh, into a mouse and creates a false copy of him. Zeniba tells Sen that Haku has stolen a magic golden seal from her that carries a deadly curse. Haku strikes the shikigami, causing Zeniba to vanish. Once he and Sen fall into the boiler room, she gives him part of the emetic dumpling to vomit up the seal and a slug that Sen disgustedly kills.\nSen resolves to return the seal and apologize to Zeniba. She confronts an engorged No-Face and feeds him the rest of the dumpling to regurgitate the workers. No-Face follows Sen out of the bathhouse, and Lin helps them leave. Sen, No-Face, and Boh travel to see Zeniba with train tickets gifted by Kamaji. Meanwhile, Yubaba nearly orders Sen's parents' slaughtering, but Haku reveals Boh is missing and offers to retrieve him if Yubaba releases Sen and her parents. Yubaba complies, but only if Sen can pass a final test.\nSen meets with Zeniba, who makes her a magic hairband and reveals that Yubaba used the slug to control Haku. Using his dragon form, Haku flies Sen and Boh back, while No-Face decides to stay with Zeniba. Mid-flight, Sen recalls falling into the Kohaku River years earlier and being washed safely ashore, correctly guessing Haku's real identity as the spirit of the Kohaku River (\u30cb\u30ae\u30cf\u30e4\u30df \u30b3\u30cf\u30af\u30cc\u30b7, Nigihayami Kohakunushi). \nWhen they arrive at the bathhouse, Yubaba tests Sen to identify her parents among a group of pigs to leave. After she answers correctly that none of the pigs are her parents, her contract disappears and she is given back her real name. Haku takes her to the now-dry riverbed and vows to meet her again. Chihiro crosses the riverbed to her restored parents. Shortly before leaving for her new home, Chihiro looks back at the tunnel with her hairband from Zeniba still intact.\n\nVoice cast\nProduction\nDevelopment and inspiration\nDuring summers, Hayao Miyazaki spent his vacation at a mountain cabin with his family and five girls who were friends of the family. The idea for Spirited Away came about when he wanted to make a film for these friends. Miyazaki had previously directed films for small children and teenagers such as My Neighbor Totoro and Kiki's Delivery Service, but he had not created a film for ten-year-old girls. For inspiration, he read the sh\u014djo manga magazines (like Nakayoshi and Ribon) that the girls had left at the cabin, but felt they only offered subjects on \"crushes\" and romance. Miyazaki felt this was not what these young friends \"held dear in their hearts\", and resolved to make the film about a young heroine whom they could look up to.\n\nMiyazaki had wanted to produce a new film for years, but his two previous proposals\u2014one based on the Japanese book Kiri no Muk\u014d no Fushigi na Machi (\u9727\u306e\u3080\u3053\u3046\u306e\u3075\u3057\u304e\u306a\u753a) by Sachiko Kashiwaba, and another about a teenage heroine\u2014were rejected. His third proposal, which ended up becoming Spirited Away, was more successful. The three stories revolved around a bathhouse that was inspired by one in Miyazaki's hometown. He thought the bathhouse was a mysterious place, and there was a small door next to one of the bathtubs in the bath house. Miyazaki was always curious about what was behind it, and he made up several stories about it, one of which inspired the bathhouse setting of Spirited Away.\n\nProduction of Spirited Away commenced in February 2000 on a budget of \u00a51.9 billion (US$15 million). Walt Disney Pictures financed ten percent of the film's production cost for the right of first refusal for American distribution. As with Princess Mononoke, Miyazaki and the Studio Ghibli staff experimented with computer animation. With the use of more computers and programs such as Softimage 3D, the staff learned the software, but used the technology carefully so that it enhanced the story, instead of \"stealing the show\". Each character was mostly hand-drawn, with Miyazaki working alongside his animators to see if they were getting it just right. The biggest difficulty in making the film was to reduce its length. When production began, Miyazaki realized it would be more than three hours long if he made it according to his plot. He had to delete many scenes from the story, and tried to reduce the \"eye candy\" in the film because he wanted it to be simple. Miyazaki did not want to make the hero a \"pretty girl\". At the beginning, he was frustrated at how she looked \"dull\" and thought, \"She isn't cute. Isn't there something we can do?\" As the film neared the end, however, he was relieved to feel \"she will be a charming woman.\"\n\nDuring production, Miyazaki often sought inspiration by visiting the Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum in Koganei, Tokyo. He based some of the buildings in the spirit world on the Pseudo-Western style buildings from the Meiji period that were available there. The museum made Miyazaki feel nostalgic, \"especially when I stand here alone in the evening, near closing time, and the sun is setting \u2013 tears well up in my eyes.\" Another major inspiration was the Notoya Ryokan (\u80fd\u767b\u8c37\u65c5\u9928), a traditional Japanese inn located in Yamagata Prefecture, famous for its exquisite architecture and ornamental features. While some guidebooks and articles claim that the old gold town of Jiufen in Taiwan served as an inspirational model for the film, Miyazaki has denied this. The D\u014dgo Onsen is also often said to be a key inspiration for the Spirited Away onsen\/bathhouse.\nToshio Suzuki, the producer of the film, also cites European inspirations and influences in the production of Spirited Away. He specifically invokes the structure of the film as European-inspired due to Miyazaki's own influences by European films such as The Snow Queen and The Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep.\n\nMusic\nThe film score of Spirited Away was composed and conducted by Miyazaki's regular collaborator Joe Hisaishi, and performed by the New Japan Philharmonic. The soundtrack received awards at the 56th Mainichi Film Competition Award for Best Music, the Tokyo International Anime Fair 2001 Best Music Award in the Theater Movie category, and the 17th Japan Gold Disk Award for Animation Album of the Year. Later, Hisaishi added lyrics to \"One Summer's Day\" and named the new version of the song \"The Name of Life\" (\u3044\u306e\u3061\u306e\u540d\u524d, \"Inochi no Namae\") which was performed by Ayaka Hirahara.\nThe closing song, \"Always With Me\" (\u3044\u3064\u3082\u4f55\u5ea6\u3067\u3082, \"Itsumo Nando Demo\", lit. 'Always, No Matter How Many Times') was written and performed by Youmi Kimura, a composer and lyre-player from Osaka. The lyrics were written by Kimura's friend Wakako Kaku. The song was intended to be used for Rin the Chimney Painter (\u7159\u7a81\u63cf\u304d\u306e\u30ea\u30f3, Entotsu-kaki no Rin), a different Miyazaki film which was never released. In the special features of the Japanese DVD, Hayao Miyazaki explains how the song in fact inspired him to create Spirited Away. The song itself would be recognized as Gold at the 43rd Japan Record Awards.\nBesides the original soundtrack, there is also an image album, titled Spirited Away Image Album (\u5343\u3068\u5343\u5c0b\u306e\u795e\u96a0\u3057\u3000\u30a4\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u30a2\u30eb\u30d0\u30e0, Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi Im\u0113ji Arubamu), that contains 10 tracks.\n\nEnglish dub\nJohn Lasseter, Pixar animator and a fan and friend of Miyazaki, would often sit with his staff and watch Miyazaki's work when encountering story problems. After seeing Spirited Away Lasseter was ecstatic. Upon hearing his reaction to the film, Disney CEO Michael Eisner asked Lasseter if he would be interested in introducing Spirited Away to an American audience. Lasseter obliged by agreeing to serve as the executive producer for the English adaptation. Following this, several others began to join the project: Beauty and the Beast co-director Kirk Wise and Aladdin co-producer Donald W. Ernst joined Lasseter as director and producer of Spirited Away, respectively. Screenwriters Cindy Davis Hewitt and Donald H. Hewitt penned the English-language dialogue, which they wrote in order to match the characters' original Japanese-language lip movements.\nThe cast of the film consists of Daveigh Chase, Jason Marsden, Suzanne Pleshette (in her final film role before her death in January 2008), Michael Chiklis, Lauren Holly, Susan Egan, David Ogden Stiers and John Ratzenberger (a Pixar regular). Advertising was limited, with Spirited Away being mentioned in a small scrolling section of the film section of Disney.com; Disney had sidelined their official website for Spirited Away and given the film a comparatively small promotional budget. Marc Hairston writing for FPS Magazine argues that this was a justified response to Studio Ghibli's retention of the merchandising rights to the film and characters, which limited Disney's ability to properly market the film.\n\nThemes\nSupernaturalism\nThe major themes of Spirited Away, heavily influenced by Japanese Shinto-Buddhist folklore, centre on the protagonist, Chihiro, and her liminal journey through the realm of spirits. The central location of the film is a Japanese bathhouse where a great variety of Japanese folklore creatures, including kami, come to bathe. Miyazaki cites the solstice rituals when villagers call forth their local kami and invite them into their baths. Chihiro also encounters kami of animals and plants. Miyazaki says of this:In my grandparents' time, it was believed that kami existed everywhere \u2013 in trees, rivers, insects, wells, anything. My generation does not believe this, but I like the idea that we should all treasure everything because spirits might exist there, and we should treasure everything because there is a kind of life to everything.Chihiro's archetypal entrance into another world changes her status as one somewhere between child and adult. Chihiro also stands outside societal boundaries in the supernatural setting. The use of the word kamikakushi (literally 'hidden by gods') within the Japanese title, and its associated folklore, reinforces this liminal passage: \"Kamikakushi is a verdict of 'social death' in this world, and coming back to this world from Kamikakushi meant 'social resurrection.'\"\nAdditional themes are expressed through No-Face, who reflects the characters who surround him, learning by example and taking the traits of whomever he consumes. This nature results in No-Face's monstrous rampage through the bathhouse. After Chihiro saves No-Face with the emetic dumpling, he becomes timid once more. At the end of the film, Zeniba decides to take care of No-Face so he can develop without the negative influence of the bathhouse.\n\nFantasy\nThe film has been compared to Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, as the stories are set in fantasy worlds, involve disturbances in logic and stability, and there are motifs such as food having metamorphic qualities; though other developments and themes are not shared.\nYubaba has many similarities to the Coachman from the 1940 film Pinocchio, in the sense that she mutates humans into pigs in a similar way that the boys of Pleasure Island were mutated into donkeys. Upon gaining employment at the bathhouse, Yubaba's seizure of Chihiro's true name symbolically kills the child, who must then assume adulthood. She then undergoes a rite of passage according to the monomyth format; to recover continuity with her past, Chihiro must create a new identity.\n\nTraditional Japanese culture\nSpirited Away contains critical commentary on modern Japanese society concerning generational conflicts and environmental issues. Chihiro has been seen as a representation of the sh\u014djo, whose roles and ideology had changed dramatically since post-war Japan. Just as Chihiro seeks her past identity, Japan, in its anxiety over the economic downturn occurring during the release of the film in 2001, sought to reconnect to past values. In an interview, Miyazaki has commented on this nostalgic element for an old Japan.\nJapanese philosophy plays a huge role in Spirited Away, specifically through concepts like Kami and principles like Mottainai and On. The concept of Kami, for instance, involves various spirits that each represent different elements and aspects of nature. The principle of Mottainai, which is deeply ingrained in Japanese culture, embodies a sense of regret towards waste, valuing the complete utilization of an object or resource. While the principle of On, a key tenet of Japanese ethics that signifies a sense of moral indebtedness, plays a significant role in Chihiro's character development.\n\nWestern consumerism\nSimilar to the Japanese concept of On, the film can be partly understood as an exploration of the effect of greediness and Western consumerism on traditional Japanese culture. For instance, Yubaba is stylistically unique within the bathhouse, wearing a Western dress and living among European d\u00e9cor and furnishings, in contrast with the minimalist Japanese style of her employees' quarters, representing the Western capitalist influence over Japan in its Meiji period and beyond. Along with its function within the ostensible coming of age theme, Yubaba's act of taking Chihiro's name and replacing it with Sen (an alternate reading of chi, the first character in Chihiro's name, lit.\u2009'one thousand') can be thought of as symbolic of capitalism's single-minded concern with value.\n\nThe film's setting encapsulates Miyazaki's commentary on modern Japanese values and the erosion of cultural heritage. The bathhouse, situated within an abandoned theme park, symbolizes Japan's distorted cultural identity. This once-traditional locale is marred by neon signs and Westernization, exemplifying cultural degradation. Early scenes highlight economic concerns and consumerism. The film's visuals underscore the commercialization of Japanese culture. The failed theme park serves as a metaphor for the unsuccessful fusion of ideologies. The Meiji design of the park is the setting for Chihiro's parents' metamorphosis \u2013 the family arrives in an imported Audi car and the father wears a European-styled polo shirt, reassuring Chihiro that he has \"credit cards and cash\", before morphing into literal consumerist pigs because of their bad habits. Miyazaki has stated:Chihiro's parents turning into pigs symbolizes how some humans become greedy. At the very moment Chihiro says there is something odd about this town, her parents turn into pigs. There were people that \"turned into pigs\" during Japan's bubble economy (consumer society) of the 1980s, and these people still haven't realized they've become pigs. Once someone becomes a pig, they don't return to being human but instead gradually start to have the \"body and soul of a pig\". These people are the ones saying, \"We are in a recession and don't have enough to eat.\" This doesn't just apply to the fantasy world. Perhaps this isn't a coincidence and the food is actually (an analogy for) \"a trap to catch lost humans\".\nThe bathhouse of the spirits cannot be seen as a place free of ambiguity and darkness. Many of the employees are rude to Chihiro because she is human, and corruption is ever-present; it is a place of excess and greed, as depicted in the initial appearance of No-Face. In stark contrast to the simplicity of Chihiro's journey and transformation is the constantly chaotic carnival in the background.\n\nEnvironmentalism\nCommentators have often referred to environmental themes in the films of Miyazaki. In Spirited Away, two major instances of allusions to environmental issues have been noted. Pam Coats, for example, a Vice President of Walt Disney Feature Animation, describes Chihiro dealing with the \"stink spirit\", who, it turns out, is actually a river spirit but is so corrupted with filth that one cannot tell what it is at first glance. It only becomes clean again when Chihiro pulls out a huge amount of trash, including car tires, garbage, and a bicycle. This alludes to human pollution of the environment, and how people can carelessly toss away things without thinking of the consequences and of where the trash will go.\nThe second allusion is seen in Haku himself. Haku does not remember his name and lost his past, which is why he is stuck at the bathhouse. Eventually, Chihiro remembers that he used to be the spirit of the Kohaku River, which was destroyed and replaced with apartments. Because of humans' need for development, they destroyed a part of nature, causing Haku to lose his home and identity. This can be compared to deforestation and destruction of natural habitats; humans tear down nature, cause imbalance in the ecosystem, and demolish animals' homes to satisfy their want for more space (housing, malls, stores, etc.) but do not think about how it can affect other living things.\n\nRelease\nBox office and theatrical release\nSpirited Away was released theatrically in Japan on 20 July 2001 by distributor Toho. It grossed a record \u00a51.6 billion ($13.1 million) in its first three days, beating the previous record set by Princess Mononoke. It was number one at the Japanese box office for its first eleven weeks and spent 16 weeks there in total. After 22 weeks of release and after grossing $224 million in Japan, it started its international release, opening in Hong Kong on 13 December 2001. It was the first film that had grossed more than $200 million at the worldwide box office excluding the United States. It went on to gross \u00a530.4 billion to become the highest-grossing film in Japanese history, according to the Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan. It also set the all-time attendance record in Japan, surpassing the 16.8 million tickets sold by Titanic. Its gross at the Japanese box office has since increased to \u00a531.68 billion, as of 2020.\nIn February 2002, Wild Bunch, an international sales company that had recently spun off from its former parent StudioCanal, picked up the international sale rights for the film outside of Asia and France. The company would then on-sell it to independent distributors across the world. On 13 April 2002, The Walt Disney Company acquired the Taiwanese, Singapore, Hong Kong, French and North American sale rights to the film, alongside Japanese Home Media rights.\nDisney's English dub of the film, supervised by Lasseter, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on 7 September 2002 and was later released in the United States on 20 September 2002. The film grossed $450,000 in its opening weekend from 26 theatres. Spirited Away had very little marketing, less than Disney's other B-films, with a maximum of 151 theatres showing the film in 2002. After the 2003 Oscars, it expanded to 714 theatres. It ultimately grossed around $10 million by September 2003. Outside of Japan and the United States, the movie was moderately successful in both South Korea and France where it grossed $11 million and $6 million, respectively. In Argentina, it is in the top 10 anime films with the most tickets sold.\nIn the United Kingdom, then-independent based film distributor Optimum Releasing acquired the rights to the movie from Wild Bunch in January 2003. The company then released it theatrically on 12 September 2003. The movie grossed $244,437 on its opening weekend from 51 theatres, and by the end of its theatrical run in October, the movie has grossed $1,383,023 in the country.\nAbout 18 years after its original release in Japan, Spirited Away had a theatrical release in China on 21 June 2019. It follows the theatrical China release of My Neighbour Totoro in December 2018. The delayed theatrical release in China was due to long-standing political tensions between China and Japan, but many Chinese became familiar with Miyazaki's films due to rampant video piracy. It topped the Chinese box office with a $28.8-million opening weekend, beating Toy Story 4 in China. In its second weekend, Spirited Away grossed a cumulative $54.8 million in China, and was second only behind Spider-Man: Far From Home that weekend. As of 16 July 2019, the film has grossed $70 million in China, bringing its worldwide total box office to over $346 million as of 8 July 2019.\nSpirited Away's worldwide box office total stands at US$395,802,070.\n\nHome media\nSpirited Away was first released on VHS and DVD formats in Japan by Buena Vista Home Entertainment on 19 July 2002. The Japanese DVD releases include storyboards for the film and the special edition includes a Ghibli DVD player. Spirited Away sold 5.5 million home video units in Japan by 2007, and holds the record for most home video copies sold of all-time in the country as of 2014. The movie was released on Blu-ray by Walt Disney Studios Japan on 14 July 2014, and DVD was also reissued on the same day with a new HD master, alongside several other Studio Ghibli movies.\nIn North America, the film was released on DVD and VHS formats by Walt Disney Home Entertainment on 15 April 2003. The attention brought by the Oscar win resulted in the film becoming a strong seller. The bonus features include Japanese trailers, a making-of documentary which originally aired on Nippon Television, interviews with the North American voice actors, a select storyboard-to-scene comparison and The Art of Spirited Away, a documentary narrated by actor Jason Marsden. The movie was released on Blu-ray by and North America by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on 16 June 2015. GKIDS and Shout! Factory re-issued the film on Blu-ray and DVD on 17 October 2017 following the expiration of Disney's previous deal with Studio Ghibli in the country in North America. On 12 November 2019, GKIDS and Shout! Factory issued a North-America-exclusive Spirited Away collector's edition, which includes the film on Blu-ray, and the film's soundtrack on CD, as well as a 40-page book with statements by Toshio Suzuki and Hayao Miyazaki, and essays by film critic Kenneth Turan and film historian Leonard Maltin. Along with the rest of the Studio Ghibli films, Spirited Away was released on digital markets in the United States for the first time, on 17 December 2019.\nIn the United Kingdom, the film was released on DVD and VHS as a rental release through independent distributor High Fliers Films PLC following the film's limited theatrical release. It was later officially released on DVD in the UK on 29 March 2004, with the distribution being done by Optimum Releasing themselves. In 2006, the DVD was reissued as a single-disc release (without the second one) with packaging matching other releases in Optimum's \"The Studio Ghibli Collection\" range. The then-renamed StudioCanal UK released the movie on Blu-ray on 24 November 2014, A British 20th Anniversary Collector's Edition, similar to other Studio Ghibli anniversary editions released in the UK, was released on 25 October 2021.\nIn the United States, the 2015 Blu-ray release grossed $9,925,660 from 557,613 physical units sold as of 21 February 2021. In the United Kingdom, the film's Studio Ghibli anniversary release appeared several times on the annual lists of best-selling foreign language film on home video, ranking number six in 2015, number five in 2016, and number one in 2019.\n\nTelevision\nThe film was aired on Nippon TV (NTV) in Japan, on 24 January 2003. It became NTV's most-watched film of all time with a 46.9% audience rating, surpassing the 35.1% record previously set by Princess Mononoke in 1999.\nIn the United Kingdom, the film was watched by 670,000 viewers on BBC2 in 2010. This made it the year's most-watched foreign-language film on BBC, and the year's second highest foreign film on UK television (below the Indian Bollywood film Om Shanti Om). Spirited Away was later watched by 300,000 UK viewers on BBC2 in 2011, making it the year's most-watched foreign-language film on BBC2. Combined, the film drew a 970,000 UK television viewership on BBC2 between 2010 and 2011.\n\nReception\nCritical response\nSpirited Away received widespread acclaim. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 96% approval rating based on 221 reviews, with an average rating of 8.6\/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"Spirited Away is a dazzling, enchanting, and gorgeously drawn fairy tale that will leave viewers a little more curious and fascinated by the world around them.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 96 out of 100 based on 41 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a full four stars, praising the work and Miyazaki's direction. Ebert also said that Spirited Away was one of \"the year's best films\", as well as adding it to his \"Great Movies\" list. Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times positively reviewed the film and praised the animation. Mitchell drew a favorable comparison to Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass, and wrote that Miyazaki's \"movies are as much about moodiness as mood\" and that \"the prospect of animated figures' not being what they seem \u2013 either spiritually or physically \u2013 heightens the tension\". Derek Elley of Variety said that Spirited Away \"can be enjoyed by sprigs and adults alike\" and praised the animation and music. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times praised Miyazaki's direction and the voice acting, as well as saying that the film is the \"product of a fierce and fearless imagination whose creations are unlike anything a person has seen before.\" Orlando Sentinel's critic Jay Boyar also praised Miyazaki's direction and said the film is \"the perfect choice for a child who has moved into a new home.\"\nIn 2004, Cinefantastique listed the film as one of the \"10 Essential Animations\". In 2005, Spirited Away was ranked by IGN as the 12th-best animated film of all time. The film is also ranked number 9 of the highest-rated movies of all time on Metacritic, being the highest rated traditionally animated film on the site. The film ranked number 10 in Empire magazine's \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\" in 2010. In 2010, Rotten Tomatoes ranked it as the 13th-best animated film on the site, and in 2012, as the 17th. In 2019, the site considered the film to be #1 among 140 essential animated movies to watch. The film was ranked at number 46 on Time Out magazine's list of \"The 100 Best Movies of All Time\". The film is listed within the top ten on the British Film Institute's list of \"Top 50 films for children up to the age of 14\". In 2016, it was voted the fourth-best film of the 21st century by the BBC, as picked by 177 film critics from around the world, making it the highest-ranking animated film on the list. In 2017, The New York Times ranked it as the second best film of the 21st Century so far. In 2021, the Writers Guild of America ranked Spirited Away's screenplay the 67th greatest of the 21st century so far. In 2022, the film was ranked number 75 on Sight & Sound's greatest films list, being one of two animated films to make the list (alongside Miyazaki's own My Neighbor Totoro).\nIn his book Otaku, Hiroki Azuma observed: \"Between 2001 and 2007, the otaku forms and markets quite rapidly won social recognition in Japan,\" and cites Miyazaki's win at the Academy Awards for Spirited Away among his examples.\n\nAccolades\nImpact and legacy\nFilm industry\nSpirited Away is frequently regarded as one of the best films of the 21st century as well as one of the greatest animated films ever made. Comic Book Resources wrote that the film \"set the bar extremely high for all anime movies that followed it \u2013 including Studio Ghibli's\" and further explained that \"It's a movie many people re-watch due to its comfort and nostalgia, and since Netflix brought the Ghibli movies to North America last year, it's become even more accessible\". Swapnil Dhruv Bose from Far Out Magazine declared the film to be \"the greatest animated film of all time\" and explained that it \"resonated with audiences all over the world despite the existence of cultural barriers is because of its brilliantly devised universality\" and has the ability to \"generate fascinating multiplicities which morph according to the age of the viewer\". In another article detailing Hayao Miyazaki's wide impact to the film industry, he wrote \"The influence of Spirited Away can be easily observed in Disney productions like Brave and Frozen, thanks to John Lasseter's (the Chief Creative Officer of Pixar) efforts to introduce it to Western audiences\". Vice also declared Spirited Away to be the all-time best animated film and wrote that the film \"showed how breathtaking, heartfelt, and serious animation can be\" that \"Pixar, Disney, and other mainstream animators have still failed to genuinely realize 15 years later\".\nFilm director Steven Spielberg said that Spirited Away might be \"better than any Disney films\" he has ever seen. Rayna Denison, professor of film, television, and media studies, told Time that \"This is a film made by a master animator at the height of his powers and it is one where the quality of the animation really does set it apart from everything else around it. Nobody else was making films that looked like this or that were as inventive as this was at this time\". The film has been cited as influence for various Disney and Pixar animated films. Production designer Harley Jessup said that he initially looked at Spirited Away and was inspired by the spiritual feelings elements to utilize them in Coco. Co-writers Ken and Ryan Firpo cited the film as one of the influences that helps them explore \"ideas of morality and humanity\" in Eternals.  Turning Red's director Domee Shi named Spirited Away as one of her favorite animated films and one of the influences for her film.\n\nCommercial and cultural significance\nAccording to Time, Spirited Away \"arrived at a time when animation was widely perceived as a genre solely for children, and when cultural differences often became barriers to the global distribution of animated works\" but it \"shattered preconceived notions about the art form and also proved that, as a film created in Japanese with elements of Japanese folklore central to its core, it could resonate deeply with audiences around the world\". Denison emphasized that John Lasseter and Disney \"boosted Spirited Away's visibility in America by heavily campaigning for the film to be considered for the Academy Awards\", and cited it as one of the reasons why it won Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. Writer Jonathan Clements, whose published works revolve around East Asian culture, anime, and Japanese television dramas, emphasized that the film's Oscar win was \"a wake-up call for a lot of people in the film business who had been disregarding Japanese animation for years\". Susan Napier, professor of Japanese studies at Tufts University, called Spirited Away's wins at major Western award shows \"a very big shot in the arm to the Japanese animation industry\". She further explained that cartoons in the West have often been seen as \"childish, vulgar, things that you didn't take seriously\" but after the film took home the Academy Award, people were starting to see animation as \"a real art form\".\n\nStage adaptation\nA stage adaptation of Spirited Away was announced in February 2021 with a world premiere planned in Tokyo on 28 February 2022. It is written and directed by John Caird, with Toho as the production company, with Studio Ghibli's blessing. The role of Chihiro is played by both Kanna Hashimoto and Mone Kamishiraishi. In August 2023, it was announced that the production would have its European premiere at the London Coliseum from April 2024, with most of the cast reprising their roles.\n\nLimited time re-release\nOn a limited time release from 11 November to 18 December in 2022, the Imperial Theater performance of the play was available for rental in Japan in several streaming services such as Abema, Amazon Prime Video Japan, Docomo Anime Store, FOD, Hulu Japan and U-Next.\nThere were 2 versions of the play available for rental:\n\nStage \"Spirited Away\" (Chihiro role: Kanna Hashimoto) \u226aImperial Theater performance version\u226b (First distribution).

It was chosen as Best Film at the Japan Academy Prize ceremony. It is one of the few notable depictions of sumo in film.\n\nPlot\nKyoritsu University student Shuhei Yamamoto gets a job with his uncle's connection but learns from the supervisor of his graduation thesis, Professor Anayama that he's missing the credits to graduate. The professor makes a deal with Shuhei that if he participates in the tournament for Kyoritsu's sumo club, he would be willing to overlook the missing credits. Shuhei reluctantly accepts at the request of Natsuko Kawamura, a graduate student from the Anayama Lab and a sumo club manager.\nThe Sumo Club's only member is Aoki Tomio, a traditionalist sumo enthusiast who has repeated years. Shuhei and Aoki struggle to recruit Shuhei's younger brother Haruo and obese Hosaku Tanaka. The amateur team loses at the tournament, and are abused by alumni at the afterparty. Shuhei promises they'll win next, recruiting a British student and experienced footballer George Smiley who joins to save on rent. During the summer vacation, the team visits Anayama's hometown for a training camp. At the end of the camp, the team plays a practice match against elementary schoolers in the neighbourhood.\nThe team wins the next third league match and replaced the second league. Haruo breaks his arm in the third match, and Shuhei is injured. Masako Mamiya, a female manager with a crush on Haruo, volunteers to join as a member. On the day of the match, Masako binds her chest with bandages and tape but loses. The Sumo Club is inspired by her attempt, with Tanaka and Aoki winning their matches. The team wins the league match in the final round, when Shuhei dramatically throws his opponent out of the ring.\nTanaka is scouted for sumo wrestling, Smiley returns to Britain, Masako and Haruo leave to study abroad in London, and Aoki graduates. Shuhei declines the job offer to continue the sumo club as the sole member. Natsuko visits him in the club, and the movie ends as they playfully practice shiko.\n\nCast\nReception\nThe film has been described by Japan Times columnist and sumo commentator John Gunning as \"well-crafted and at times touching\" and he notes that it is virtually the only big-screen sumo film with the exception of the Wakanohana Kanji I biopic Devil of the Dohy\u014d.\n\nAwards and nominations\n16th Japan Academy Prize \n\nWon: Best Picture\nWon: Best Director - Masayuki Suo\nWon: Best Screenplay - Masayuki Suo\nWon: Best Actor - Masahiro Motoki\nWon: Best Supporting Actor - Naoto Takenaka\nNominated: Best Supporting Actress - Misa Shimizu\nNominated: Best Editing - Junichi Kikuchi\n\nTV series\nThe film was remade as a television series, with Misa Shimizu and Naoto Takenaka reprising their roles, which premiered on Disney+ on October 26, 2022.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nSumo Do, Sumo Don't at IMDb\nShino Funjatta at AllMovie\n\u30b7\u30b3\u3075\u3093\u3058\u3083\u3063\u305f\u3002 (in Japanese).

His late arrival at the memorial irritates his father (Masat\u014d Ibu), who accuses him of disrespecting his late mother and shaming their family name. Takeru's older brother Minoru (Teruyuki Kagawa) quickly intervenes and soothes their father with drinks and sympathetic comments.\nTakeru and Minoru later have a conversation, which reveals Takeru's thinly veiled contempt towards Minoru for not having the strength to leave their dead-end hometown, but Minoru tells him he doesn't understand how things are and besides, he's fine with the way things are. Takeru later learns that his brother has taken over their family business, a run-down garage, and that his ex-girlfriend, Chieko (Y\u014dko Maki), now works there as a gas attendant.\nChieko and Takeru later meet for drinks, and proceed to have a one-night stand. In the morning after, she hesitantly suggests she would be happy to follow him to Tokyo when he leaves, but he pretends he doesn't hear her.\nMinoru realises something has happened between his younger brother and Chieko, and suggests they all should go for a walk along the Hasami River in the mountains where Takeru could take photographs. Chieko, believing this would buy more time with Takeru, immediately agrees. Wanting to get away from their town's mundaneness, Takeru agrees.\nDuring the trip, Takeru distances himself from Chieko by walking ahead of her and Minoru. Whilst on a forested mountain, he takes photographs and through his viewfinder, sees Minoru and Chieko talking on a suspension bridge over a gorge. He looks away to take photographs of flowers.\nOn the bridge, Minoru tries to catch Chieko when she stumbles, but she recoils from his touch as she shouts at him to get away from her. They stare at each other for a few tense seconds. Minoru asks if she's leaving him for Takeru. Chieko replies that she has no interest in him, and never will.\nTakeru glances back to the bridge and sees Minoru alone on the bridge, looking down to the gorge below, and realises Chieko has fallen from the bridge. The police locates Chieko's body in the gorge and arrests Minoru for murder. His father rejects the charge, insisting Minoru isn't the type to kill, but Takeru isn't so sure.\nAs the case proceeds during a courtroom trial, Takeru begins to doubt his testimony when he realises hidden resentment and deeply buried anger between Minoru and himself, which may have affected what he witnessed on the bridge that afternoon.\n\nAwards\nSway won the Best Film award at the 2007 Yokohama Film Festival. and the Best Film award at the 2006 Mainichi Film Award.\n\nCast\nJo Odagiri - Takeru Hayakawa\nTeruyuki Kagawa - Minoru Hayakawa\nMasat\u014d Ibu - Isamu Hayakawa (father)\nY\u014dko Maki - Chieko Kawabata\nHirofumi Arai - Yohei Okajima\nKeiz\u014d Kanie - Osamu Hayakawa\nY\u016bichi Kimura - Akihito Maruo\nTomorowo Taguchi - Judge\nPierre Taki - Funaki\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nYureru at IMDb","185":"S\u014djir\u014d Motoki (\u672c\u6728 \u8358\u4e8c\u90ce, Motoki S\u014djir\u014d) was a Japanese filmmaker who served primarily as a film producer, but also as a writer and director.  He was most famous for producing several films for Akira Kurosawa, including Seven Samurai, Ikiru and Throne of Blood.  He also produced films for other directors, including Mikio Naruse, for whom he produced Spring Awakens and Battle of Roses, and Kazuo Mori, for whom he produced Vendetta for a Samurai.  As a writer, he provided the story for Kei Kumai's 1968 film The Sands of Kurobe, starring Kurosawa favorite Toshiro Mifune.\nBesides the films he is credited with producing, Motoki also had an influence on other Kurosawa films.  For example, he was involved in the production of Rashomon.  Motoki sent the letter to screenwriter Shinobu Hashimoto inviting him to help expand the script of Rashomon.\nDuring the late 1940s, Motoki joined with directors Kurosawa, Senkichi Taniguchi and Kajiro Yamamoto (eventually joined by Naruse as well) to form a short-lived independent production company, the Motion Picture Art Association, which was responsible for such films as Rashomon, The Quiet Duel and Stray Dog.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nS\u014djir\u014d Motoki at IMDb","186":"Takashi Shimura (\u5fd7\u6751 \u55ac, Shimura Takashi, March 12, 1905 \u2013 February 11, 1982) was a Japanese actor who appeared in over 200 films between 1934 and 1981. He appeared in 21 of Akira Kurosawa's 30 films (more than any other actor), including as a lead actor in Drunken Angel (1948), Rashomon (1950), Ikiru (1952) and Seven Samurai (1954). He played Professor Kyohei Yamane in Ishir\u014d Honda's original Godzilla (1954) and its first sequel, Godzilla Raids Again (1955). For his contributions to the arts, the Japanese government decorated Shimura with the Medal with Purple Ribbon in 1974 and the Order of the Rising Sun, 4th Class, Gold Rays with Rosette in 1980.\n\nEarly life\nShimura was born Sh\u014dji Shimazaki (\u5cf6\u5d0e \u6377\u723e, Shimazaki Sh\u014dji) in Ikuno, Hy\u014dgo Prefecture, Japan. His forebears were members of the samurai class: in 1868 his grandfather took part in the Battle of Toba\u2013Fushimi during the Boshin War. Shimura entered Ikuno Primary School in 1911 and Kobe First Middle School in 1917. He missed two years of schooling because of a mild case of tuberculosis, and subsequently moved to the prefectural middle school in Nobeoka, Miyazaki Prefecture, where his father had been transferred by his employer, Mitsubishi Mining. At Nobeoka Middle School, he excelled in English and became active on the literary society's magazine, to which he contributed poetry. He also became a star of the rowing club.\nIn 1923, he entered Kansai University, but after his father's retirement the family could no longer afford the fees for a full-time course and he switched to the part-time evening course in English literature, supporting himself by working at the Osaka municipal waterworks. Among the teachers in the English Literature Department were the playwright Toyo-oka Sa-ichir\u014d (\u8c4a\u5ca1\u4f50\u4e00\u90ce) and the Shakespeare scholar Tsubouchi Shik\u014d (\u576a\u5185\u58eb\u884c). These two inspired in Shimura an enthusiasm for drama. He joined the University's Theatre Studies Society and in 1928 formed an amateur theatrical group, the Shichigatsu-za (\u4e03\u6708\u5ea7) with Toyo-oka as director. He began to miss work because of the time he spent on theatrical activities and eventually lost his job. He then left university to try to earn a living in the theatre. The Shichigatsu-za turned professional and began to tour, but got into financial difficulties and folded.\n\nCareer\nAfter the failure of the Shichigatsu-za, Shimura went back to Osaka, where he began to get roles in radio plays. In 1930 he joined the Kindaiza (\u8fd1\u4ee3\u5ea7) theatre company and became a fully professional actor. He toured China and Japan with the Kindaiza, but in 1932 he left the company and returned again to Osaka, where he appeared with the Shinseigeki (\u65b0\u58f0\u5287) and Shinsenza (\u65b0\u9078\u5ea7) troupes. Talking pictures were just then coming in and Shimura realised they would provide opportunities for stage-trained actors. In 1932 he joined the Kyoto studios of the film production company Shink\u014d Kinema. He made his film debut in the 1934 silent Ren'ai-gai itch\u014dme (\u604b\u611b\u8857\u4e00\u4e01\u76ee: Number One, Love Street). The first film in which he had a speaking part was the 1935 Ch\u016bji uridasu (\u5fe0\u6b21\u58f2\u51fa\u3059), directed by Mansaku Itami. His first substantial film role was as a detective in Mizoguchi Kenji's 1936 Osaka Elegy (Naniwa erejii; \u6d6a\u83ef\u60b2\u6b4c).\n\nThe film which established his reputation as a first-rate actor was Itami Mansaku's 1936 Akanishi Kakita (\u8d64\u897f\u8823\u592a: Capricious Young Man). In 1937 he moved to Nikkatsu film corporation's Kyoto studios, and between then and 1942 appeared in nearly 100 films. His most notable role in these years was that of Keishir\u014d in the long-running series Umon Torimono-ch\u014d (\u53f3\u9580\u6355\u7269\u5e16), starring Kanj\u016br\u014d Arashi. He also demonstrated his considerable ability as a singer in the 1939 \"cine-operetta\", Singing Lovebirds. During this time the political regime in Japan was growing ever more oppressive, and Shimura was arrested by the Special Higher Police (Tokubetsu K\u014dt\u014d Keisatsu, known as Tokk\u014d) and held for about three weeks because of his earlier association with left-wing theatre groups. He was eventually released on the recognisance of his wife Masako and fellow-actor Ry\u016bnosuke Tsukigata. He is said to have made use of this experience later when playing a Tokk\u014d official in Akira Kurosawa's 1946 No Regrets for Our Youth. When Nikkatsu and Daiei merged in 1942, Shimura moved to the K\u014da Eiga studios and then in 1943 to T\u014dh\u014d. A few weeks before the end of the Pacific War in August 1945, Shimura's elder brother was killed in Southeast Asia.\n\nIn 1943, Shimura appeared as the old jujutsu teacher Murai Hansuke, a character based on the historical Hansuke Nakamura, in Kurosawa's debut movie, Sanshiro Sugata. Along with Toshir\u014d Mifune, Shimura is the actor most closely associated with Kurosawa: he eventually appeared in 21 of Kurosawa's 30 films. In fact, Kurosawa's cinematic collaboration with Shimura, from Sanshiro Sugata in 1943 to Kagemusha in 1980, started earlier and lasted longer than his work with Mifune (1948\u201365). Shimura's performances for Kurosawa included the doctor in Drunken Angel (1948), the veteran detective in Stray Dog (1949), the flawed lawyer in Scandal (1950), the woodcutter in Rashomon (1950), the mortally ill bureaucrat in Ikiru (1952), and the lead samurai Kambei in Seven Samurai (1954). Kurosawa wrote the part in Kagemusha specifically for Shimura, but the scenes were cut from the Western release, so many in the West did not know that he had been in the film. The DVD release of the film by The Criterion Collection restored Shimura's footage.\nShimura appeared in a number of T\u014dh\u014d kaiju (giant monster) and tokusatsu (special effects) films, many of which were directed by Kurosawa's good friend and colleague Ishir\u014d Honda. Shimura's roles included Professor Kyohei Yamane in the original Godzilla (1954), a character he briefly reprised in Godzilla Raids Again (1955).\n\nDeath\nShimura died on February 11, 1982, in Tokyo, Japan, from emphysema at the age of 76. His effects were presented to the Film Centre of the National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo.\n\nFilmography\nTelevision\nAk\u014d R\u014dshi (1964)\nTen to Chi to (1969), Nagao Fusakage\nHaru no Sakamichi (1971), Aoyama Tadatoshi\nDaich\u016bshingura (1971), Horiuchi Denzaemon\nAkai Unmei (1976)\n\u014cgon no Hibi (1978), Notoya\nFum\u014d Chitai (1979), Tanigawa\n\nHonours\nMedal with Purple Ribbon (1974)\nOrder of the Rising Sun, 4th Class, Gold Rays with Rosette (1980)\n\nReferences\nSources\nRyfle, Steve (1998).

It was the first film to be produced under Kurosawa's own independent production company. It was entered into the 11th Berlin International Film Festival.\nThe film stars Toshiro Mifune as a young man who gets a prominent position in a corrupt postwar Japanese company in order to expose the men responsible for his father's death. It draws upon Shakespeare's Hamlet, while also doubling as a critique of corporate corruption. It is one of four films, along with Drunken Angel (1948), Stray Dog (1949) and High and Low (1963), in which Kurosawa explores the film noir genre. Like Kurosawa and Mifune's next two movies, Yojimbo (1961) and Sanjuro (1962), Mifune's character is \"a lone hero fighting against overwhelming odds and corrupt authorities.\"\n\nPlot\nA group of news reporters watch and gossip at an elaborate wedding reception held by the Public Development Corporation's Vice President Iwabuchi, who married his daughter Yoshiko to his secretary Koichi Nishi. The police interrupt the wedding to arrest corporate assistant officer Wada, who is the reception's master of ceremony, on charges of bribery in a kickback scheme. The reporters comment this incident is similar to an earlier scandal involving Iwabuchi, administrative officer Moriyama, and contract officer Shirai that was hushed up after the suicide of Assistant Chief Furuya, who had jumped from a seventh-story window of the corporate office building, which brought the investigation to a dead end, before any of the company's higher-ups could be implicated. Following the wedding, the police question Wada and accountant Miura about bribery between Dairyu Construction Company and the government-funded Public Corporation.\nFollowing the inquiry, Miura commits suicide by running in front of a truck when about to be arrested. Wada attempts to take his own life by jumping into an active volcano. But Nishi, pursuing Wada, stops the suicide attempt. To convince Wada to help him and his best friend Itakura in their agenda of revenge, Nishi then drives Wada where they both are shown spying on the (pre-scripted) funeral, that reveals to Wada what his employers thought of him. Nishi then focuses his efforts on contract officer Shirai by setting him up so that Iwabuchi and Moriyama believe him to be stealing from them, while also using Wada to drive him insane with guilt. Nishi then saves Shirai from an assassin hired by Iwabuchi before taking him to the office where Furuya died, revealing himself as Furuya's illegitimate son who exchanged identities with Itakura to avenge his father's death. Nishi's interrogation methods shatter what little sanity Shirai had left, with Moriyama deducing that someone connected to Furuya is orchestrating these events as he soon learns the truth about Nishi and informs Iwabuchi. Iwabuchi's son Tatsuo overhears and angrily drives Nishi off when he returns to the house.\nRetreating to the ruins of a factory he worked at during World War II, Nishi manages to abduct Moriyama and starves him into revealing the location of evidence he can use to expose the corruption and all involved to the press. In the meantime, Wada slips away and brings back Yoshiko in the hopes that the newlyweds will reconcile. Nishi tells his wife that he has grown to truly love her. Yoshiko accepts the truth about her father's evil deeds and reluctantly agrees to allow Nishi to complete his plans to expose him. But as Nishi calls for a press conference to be held the next day and prepares to retrieve the final evidence, Iwabuchi deduces Yoshiko saw Nishi and tricks her by claiming Tatsuo intends to kill Nishi while promising to turn himself in. She offers to go with Iwabuchi, but he drugs his daughter with wine laced with sleeping pills.\nYoshiko comes to by the time Tatsuo returns home from duck hunting, realizing her father tricked her as they rush to Nishi's location. But they are too late, Itakura revealing that Nishi had been killed under the cover of drunk driving crash with Wada, Moriyama, and the evidence all disposed of. All three are devastated by this development, knowing the truth but having nothing to back up their story. After canceling Nishi's conference, Iwabuchi's children confront him and disown him. Iwabuchi receives a call from his superior and apologizes for the recent trouble while assuring them that he handled it. He then requests retirement, but his superior advises him to take a vacation. Iwabuchi proceeds to hang up after apologizing, as he lost his sense of time from having not slept at all the previous night.\n\nCast\nProduction\nWhile a critical and commercial success, Toho Studios grew frustrated with Kurosawa going overbudget during filming of The Hidden Fortress, and in response, Kurosawa decided to form his film company Kurosawa Productions in 1959. As his first independent film, Kurosawa believed that it would be insulting to the audience to make a movie with the intention of only making money and decided that his next film would be about a subject of social significance.\nThe idea for The Bad Sleep Well came from Kurosawa's nephew Yoshio Inoue, whose story called \"Bad Men's Prosperity\" was used as the basis for Kurosawa's draft. Kurosawa began writing the script with Eijir\u014d Hisaita, whom he had collaborated with on No Regrets for Our Youth and The Idiot, both starring Setsuko Hara. Kurosawa's other writing collaborators Hideo Oguni, Ry\u016bz\u014d Kikushima and Shinobu Hashimoto would later join Kurosawa and Hisaita in the writing process once they were free from other projects. The process of writing the script took 80 days, with the script being carefully written to not resemble actual real-life cases of corruption in Japan.\nFilming began in March 22, 1960, with the Navy Yard of Toyohashi, Mount Aso, Marunouchi Building and the Yokohama Prison serving as main locations for the film. To convincingly play the part of a disabled wife, Ky\u014dko Kagawa used uneven shoes and a knee brace. During filming of a car scene, Kagawa suffered injuries in her face and considered quitting her acting career. At the hospital where she was being treated, Toshiro Mifune stopped the press from interviewing her by standing in front of the door to her room.\n\nReception\nContemporary reviews were positive, with a Bosley Crowther piece in The New York Times from January 1963 calling it \u201dan aggressive and chilling drama of modern-day Japan\u201d which \u201dgives to an ordinary tale of greedy and murderous contention a certain basic philosophical tone\u201d. It praises Kurosawa for staging \u201dwhat amounts to cliches in this type of strongarm fiction in a way that makes them seem fresh and as fully of sardonic humor as though we had never seen their likes before\u201d. Dan Schneider considers it one of Kurosawa\u2019s finest movies.\nThe most common criticism of the film among professional reviewers refers to the ending. In a 2006 review of the Criterion Collection DVD release, The A.V. Club's Keith Phipps calls it \"an assured, muscular Kurosawa film [...] that it's all the more disappointing when a shapeless, anticlimactic, but probably inevitable ending does it in\".\nAt the 14th Mainichi Film Awards, Masayuki Mori and Masaru Sato won the awards for Best Supporting Actor and Best Music.\nAmerican filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola has listed The Bad Sleep Well as one of his favorite films, citing the first thirty minutes of the film \"as perfect as any film I've ever seen\" and used it as inspiration for the wedding sequence in the 1972 Oscar-winning gangster drama The Godfather.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nThe Bad Sleep Well at AllMovie\nThe Bad Sleep Well at IMDb\nThe Bad Sleep Well at the TCM Movie Database\nThe Bad Sleep Well at Rotten Tomatoes\nThe Bad Sleep Well (in Japanese) at the Japanese Movie Database\nThe Bad Sleep Well: The Higher Depths, an essay by Chuck Stephens at the Criterion Collection\nKurosawa's Hamlet? by Kaori Ashizu at the Wayback Machine (archived 23 July 2008)","188":"TV Asahi Corporation, commonly abbreviated as Tere Asa (\u30c6\u30ec\u671d), with the call sign JOEX-DTV (channel 5), is a Japanese television station subsidiary of certified broadcasting holding company TV Asahi Holdings Corporation, itself controlled by The Asahi Shimbun Company serving as the flagship station of the All-Nippon News Network.

Among the three, one of them is used by NHK Educational TV, while the other two were open for private bidding. Among those bidders are film production companies Toho and Toei Company, radio broadcasters Nippon Cultural Broadcasting and Nippon Broadcasting System, and educational publishing group Obunsha.:\u200a11\u201313\u200aOn July 4, 1957, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications later decided to unify those applications into Tokyo Educational Television (as its tentative name) which was later obtained on July 8.:\u200a19\u201320\u200a\nOn October 10, 1957, Tokyo Educational Television held its first shareholders meeting and changed its company name to Nippon Educational Television Co., Ltd. (NET).:\u200a22\u200a In November 1 of the same year, the broadcaster was later established.:\u200a24\u200aAfter Fuji Television obtained their broadcast licenses, they set an official start date of broadcast on March 1, 1959. NET advanced their start date of broadcast a month earlier (February 1, 1959).:\u200a33\u200aOn Christmas Eve 1958, NET began its test transmissions.:\u200a33\u200a On January 9 of the following year, their broadcast license was approved, and test transmissions continued every night throughout the month.:\u200a34\n\nAs Nippon Educational Television\nAt 9:55a.m. on February 1, 1959, NET signed on, airing at least 6.5 hours of programming per day.:\u200a39\u200aBy April, this figure was extended to 10 hours.:\u200a42\u200aWith the launch of the Mainichi Broadcasting System and Kyushu Asahi Broadcasting on March 1, 1959, NET programming started airing on those mentioned broadcasters. Shortly after the start of broadcasts, NET broadcast their first live program, which is the wedding of Crown Prince (now Emperor Emeritus) Akihito and Empress Michiko held on April 10 of the same year.:\u200a49\u201350\u200a\nAt the time, its broadcasting license dictated that the network was required to devote at least 50% of its airtime to educational programming, and at least 30% of its airtime to children's educational programming. However, the for-profit educational television model eventually proved to be a failure. In July 1959, average ratings of the network were less than 5%.:\u200a54\u200a\nIn 1960, NET began its transformation into a general-purpose television station. It began to broadcast anime and foreign movies (in the following years, the channel contains not only original anime but also foreign cartoons dubbed into Japanese and some subtitled). So as not to run afoul of the educational TV license requirements, NET justified the airing of these programs under the pretext of \"nurturing a child's emotional range\" (\u5b50\u4f9b\u306e\u60c5\u64cd\u6559\u80b2\u306e\u305f\u3081, Kodomo no j\u014ds\u014d ky\u014diku no tame) and \"introduction of foreign cultures\" (\u5916\u56fd\u6587\u5316\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb, Gaikoku bunka no sh\u014dkai). In December 1960, NET also changed its common name from Nippon Educational Television to NET TV (NET\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3).:\u200a64\u201365\u200aThe change also made its ratings to reach about 10% after 1963. Although it still ranks at the bottom rank of other rival broadcasters, it has greatly narrowed the gap between it and the other three.:\u200a57\u200a\nSince April 1961, the station began adding primetime programming.:\u200a66\u200a Two years later, NET announced its arrival into the anime race with the Toei produced Wolf Boy Ken. The first of many Toei Animation productions, its premiere began a long line of animated cartoons and series that the station has aired until today.\nIn November 1963, NET joined forces with NHK General TV for the first live via satellite telecast in Japanese TV history.\n\nTransition from educational to entertainment programming\nThe switch to general programming also led to an infighting among the management. In contrast to the then-president of NET TV, Hiroshi Ogawa (from Toei Company), who was actively promoting entertainment programs, Yoshio Akao (from Obunsha) thought that too many entertainment programs were against the original purpose of the educational TV station and was strongly dissatisfied with the vulgar programs that filled NET TV's program schedule at that time.:\u200a61\u201362\u200aIn November 1964, Akao, together with shareholders other than Toei and Nikkei, Inc., succeeded in its major reorganization, forcing Ogawa to resign from the presidency.:\u200a61\u200aSince then, Toei's influence in NET TV has been gradually replaced by Asahi Shimbun.:\u200a93\u200aThe following year, the Asahi Shimbun appointed to the post of station director Koshiji Miura (former Deputy Minister of Political Affairs).:\u200a86\u201392\u200a\nIn the 1960s, NET TV also started airing foreign films as part of its schedule.:\u200a67\u200aThe NET TV premiere of The Morning Show in 1964 created a trend for a news-talk format on daytime Japanese TV, causing other networks to follow suit, it was the first Japanese morning program in its format.:\u200a116\u200aHy\u014dten, NET TV's drama in 1966, had a 42.7% ratings in its finale.:\u200a121\u200aThe success of the drama made the network to adjust its target audiences to single and married females.:\u200a127\u200aDespite heavily focusing on entertainment programs, they continued to broadcast educational programs, albeit on a limited number of hours every morning.:\u200a77\u200a In 1967, NET TV launched the Minkyokyo to strengthen the production of educational programs.:\u200a74\u201375,\u200a132\u200aIn April 1967, they started to broadcast in color TV, and by 1969, all of its programs were broadcast in color.:\u200a134\u2013135\u200aAfter 1968, many regional broadcasters in Japan began to pop up. This led to the broadcaster launching the All-Nippon News Network on April 1, 1970, the country's 4th national network, with NET producing national news and other nationally produced programming for the regional channels that had joined the network.:\u200a161\u2013163\u200aWith the continuous network expansion, NET TV shifted its focus on its target audience again, this time from females, to being family oriented similar to the US PBS.:\u200a169\u2013170\u200a\nBut the best was yet to come. One year after ANN was launched, the ground-breaking superhero series such as Kamen Rider, Metal Hero Series, and Super Sentai are produced by Toei, since its national premiere in April 1971 on NET TV and the ANN network. This program ended the long-standing tokusatsu duopoly TBS and Fuji Television then had with the then hit Ultra Series franchise almost half a decade ago on TBS and the fact that since 1958, these two were the only Japanese TV stations to air tokusatsu productions so far, TBS the first and Fuji the second. With its hit premiere, a rivalry was beginning to start between the three, with TBS seeing NET's tokusatsu programming as a threat. Toei's decision to successfully pitch the series to NET was seen by its staff as revenge for the removal of Hiroshi Ogawa from the NET TV presidency in 1964.\n\nAs Asahi National Broadcasting\nIn November 1973, the Ministry of Posts revised its plans on how TV broadcasters would operate, including abolishing education-focused TV broadcasting. Therefore, NET's transformation into a general-purpose television station was complete by that same month, when NET, along with the educational channel \"Tokyo Channel 12\" (now TV Tokyo) in Tokyo applied and received a general purpose television station license.:\u200a200\u2013201\u200a In March of the following year, both ended their broadcasts of educational programming, completing the transition.:\u200a200\u2013201\u200aJapan's major newspapers are also sorting out their holdings in TV stations. The Nikkei transferred its ownership of NET TV to The Asahi Shimbun, making the latter the largest shareholder of NET TV.:\u200a204\u2013205\u200a On April 1, 1975, the ANN affiliation in the Kansai Region changed hands, from Mainichi Broadcasting System, Asahi Broadcasting Corporation assumed the network affiliation slot.:\u200a209\u2013214\u200a Days later, the channel debuted another Ishinomori creation, Himitsu Sentai Gorenger, yet another Toei production, and it would be a stunning success (this was the same month when Kamen Rider jumped ship to rival TBS with the season premiere of Kamen Rider Stronger, the franchise would return to what is now TV Asahi in 2000). The series marked the beginning of the Super Sentai franchise and established NET as a force to be reckoned with regarding toku productions and anime.\nOn April 1, 1977, the corporate name of NET TV was changed to Asahi National Broadcasting Co., Ltd, with the name of its channel changed to TV Asahi.:\u200a240\u2013241\u200aThis also symbolizes that the Asahi Shimbun has the right to operate TV Asahi both in name and in essence.:\u200a122\u2013123\u200aSince December 17, 1978, TV Asahi has been broadcasting programs with stereo audio.:\u200a267\u2013268\u200a The corporation also started entering into different ventures such as publishing in the late 70s to gain revenue other than advertising.:\u200a264\u2013265\u200a\nIn 1977, thanks to his close relationship with Ivan Ivanovich, head of the Japanese Section of the International Department of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Koshiji Miura was able to meet with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and help TV Asahi obtain exclusive broadcasting rights for the 1980 Moscow Olympics in Japan. This was the first time that a private TV station in Japan was exclusively granted the broadcasting rights of the Olympic Games,:\u200a241\u2013246\u200a but this was controversial as rival broadcasters including NHK opposed the move.:\u200a302\u2013303\u200a Japan followed the Western countries in boycotting the 1980 Summer Olympics.:\u200a280\u2013284\u200aAs a result, TV Asahi only aired high-profile Olympic events:\u200a284\u2013287\u200a and the broadcaster had significant losses in its revenue.:\u200a156\n\nRoppongi HQ Redevelopment\nAs the broadcaster expanded its business, its HQ ran out of space. Since its HQ was located in a residential area, it became difficult to expand its existing infrastructure.:\u200a316\u200aTV Asahi collaborated with property development firm Mori Building Company to redevelop the Roppongi area. While the new HQ was under development, TV Asahi temporarily moved to the newly built studios in Ark Hills.:\u200a315\u2013317\u200a In 1985, the Ark Broadcasting Center was officially completed.:\u200a225\u200aAs Japan entered into the economic bubble era, local residents around the Roppongi area had a negative perception towards the redevelopment of the said area, which resulted into delaying the redevelopment plan.:\u200a236\u2013237\u200aThe old headquarters was demolished in 2000. Prior to the new headquarters being built on the site, offices of TV Asahi were located in multiple locations around Tokyo, including the studios in Ark Hills.:\u200a280\u2013285\n\nPre-transition to TV Asahi Corporation\nThe launch of the evening news program \"News Station\" and \"Super J Channel\" in 1985 and 1997 helped TV Asahi establish its positive viewership advantage at 5pm and 10pm on weekdays, strengthening its position in news programs as a partnership with Warner Bros. Discovery-owned CNN and Disney Entertainment-owned ABC News from the US.:\u200a228\u2013229\u200aIn 1987, ANN had a total of 14 regional affiliated stations, much smaller than the other 3 networks (JNN and FNN had 25 each and NNN had 27). However, affected by the economic bubble at that time, Kikuo Tashiro (then president of TV Asahi), announced that it wouldn't open more regional stations which resulted in protest from the existing stations. As a result, the decision was reverted and decided to open 10 more stations.:\u200a233\u200aIn response to the arrival of satellite TV, TV Asahi established TV Asahi Satellite Corporation in 1991.:\u200a237\u2013238\u200a\nAfter Iwate Asahi Television started broadcasting in 1996, the number of ANN stations reached 26, announcing that the broadcaster has already completed the establishment of its national network.:\u200a242\u200aIn June of the same year, media tycoon Rupert Murdoch and investor Masayoshi Son planned to buy a large stake of TV Asahi, jeopardizing the status of Asahi Shimbun as the major shareholder.:\u200a238\u2013244\u200aIn this regard, Toshitada Nakae personally went to the US to meet Murdoch and asked him not to increase his shareholding to TV Asahi.:\u200a246\u2013248\u200aBy the following year, Asahi Shimbun purchased the shares of Asahi TV held by Murdoch and Son.:\u200a262\u200aTV Asahi is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange since October 3, 2000.:\u200a252\u200aMultiple changes happened since 2000 after TV Asahi had been staying in the same 4th place for 10 consecutive years in TV ratings.:\u200a62\u201363, 253\u200aIn April 2000, major changes in its schedules, such as starting its programs a few minutes before the top of the hour and improving its entertainment programming at late-night.:\u200a254\u200a TV Asahi launched BS Asahi in December 2000, the satellite version of its main terrestrial channel.:\u200a259\u2013260\n\nReturn to Roppongi and renaming to TV Asahi Corporation\nOn September 29, 2003, TV Asahi moved back its head office from its Ark Hills Studio to Roppongi Hills.:\u200a261\u200a On October 1, the company changed its name to TV Asahi Corporation, with the name presented as TV asahi on-screen, commemorating the 45th anniversary of the launch.:\u200a260\u200aAs part of digital broadcasting, TV Asahi started to broadcast on digital TV, being designated to channel 5.:\u200a266\u2013267\u200a In 2004, TV Asahi's ratings reached 7.5% ranking third among the commercial broadcasters in the Kanto Region after a lapse of 32 years.:\u200a262\u200aThe ratings would further improve by the following year, ranking first in late-night TV ratings.:\u200a260\u200aHowever, in 2008, affected by the global recession, TV Asahi recorded its first annual loss of revenue.:\u200a132\u200aIn 2009, Hiroshi Hayakawa became the president of the broadcaster, being the first president of TV Asahi who had been serving the broadcaster since its inauguration.:\u200a14\u200a Between April and June 2012, TV Asahi won in the Triple Crown ratings for the first time with 12.3% in primetime, 12.7% in evening time, and 7.9% for whole day.:\u200a17\u200a\nOn May 10, 2011, TV Asahi launched its mascot \"Go-chan\" which was designed by Sanrio.:\u200a122\u2013123\u200a\nOn April 1, 2014, TV Asahi became a certified broadcasting holding company \"TV Asahi Holdings, Inc.\", and newly founded \"TV Asahi Corporation\" took over the broadcasting business.\nThe transmission of international aquatics competitions, FIFA World Cup football matches, and creation of popular late-night TV programs contributed to a rise in ratings for TV Asahi and lifted the TV station from its popularly ridiculed \"perpetual fourth place\" finish into second place, right behind Fuji TV, by 2005. Disney-owned ABC signed a strategic alliance with former rival commercial broadcaster Fuji TV due to sluggish viewership ratings.\nThe station also launched its own mascot, G\u014d EX Panda (\u30b4\u30fc\u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30d1\u30f3\u30c0, G\u014d Ekkusu Panda), also known as G\u014d-chan (\u30b4\u30fc\u3061\u3083\u3093\u3002) G\u014d-chan is currently seen on TV Asahi's opening sign-on ID.\n\nBranding\nTV Asahi's current branding were created by British design collective Tomato (some members work as the electronic music group Underworld) along with TV Asahi's in-house design department in 2003. It comprises a set of computer-generated \"sticks\" in white background, which changes in colour and movement along with the background music that accompanies the idents. TV Asahi also uses a brief eyecatch of its sticks animation at the top-left of the screen after commercial breaks. The background music used for TV Asahi's sign-on and sign-off videos are Underworld's Born Slippy .NUXX 2003 and Rez. TV Asahi later updated its sign-on and sign-off video in 2008 with a revised version of computer-generated \"sticks\" animation and new background music. TV Asahi's slogan New Air, On Air. appears at the top of its name. It can be seen on TV Asahi's YouTube channel, which in 2011\u201312, was replaced by its mascot, Go-Chan.\nThe company writes its name in lower-case letters, tv asahi, in its logo and public-image materials. Normally, the station branding on-screen appears as either \"\/tv asahi\" or \"tv asahi\\\". The station's watermark appearance is the stick at the top with the station's name at the bottom. The fonts used by TV Asahi for the written parts are Akzidenz Grotesk Bold (English) and Hiragino Kaku Gothic W8 (Japanese).\nFrom 1991 to 2001, TV Asahi was unique among the national television networks for its English language theme song, Join Us, which was used for both the startup and closedown sequences. Before that, from 1977 to 1987, another song was used for these (instrumental only from 1978, formerly with vocals).\n\nCoverage\nCurrent\nBroadcasting rights\nFootball (Soccer)\nFIFA\nNational teams\nFIFA World Cup\nFIFA Women's World Cup\nJFA\nJapan women's national football team\nJapan national football team\nAFC\nAFC Asian Cup (shared with DAZN)\nPremier League (shared with Abema)\n\nBasketball\nFIBA\nFIBA Basketball World Cup\n\nGolf\nU.S. Open\nThe Open Championship\n\nWrestling\nNew Japan Pro-Wrestling\n\nMulti-sport events\nWorld Aquatics Championships\nOlympic Games (via Japan Consortium)\nHPEO Games\nSummer Olympic Games\nWinter Olympic Games\nYouth Olympic Games\n\nTV broadcasting\nSince 2004, the funding of this station is through sponsorship.\n\nAnalog\n(until July 24, 2011, only for 44 out of 47 prefectures)\nJOEX-TV \u2013 TV Asahi Analog Television (\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u671d\u65e5\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3)\n\nTokyo Tower \u2013 VHF Channel 10\nTokyo\n\nHachi\u014dji \u2013 Channel 45\nTama \u2013 Channel 57\nIslands in Tokyo\n\nChichijima \u2013 Channel 59\nIbaraki Prefecture\n\nMito \u2013 Channel 36\nHitachi \u2013 Channel 60\nTochigi Prefecture\n\nUtsunomiya \u2013 Channel 41\nGunma Prefecture\n\nMaebashi \u2013 Channel 60\nSaitama Prefecture\n\nChichibu \u2013 Channel 38\nChiba Prefecture\n\nNarita \u2013 Channel 59\nTateyama \u2013 Channel 60\nKanagawa Prefecture\n\nYokohama-minato \u2013 Channel 60\nYokosuka-Kurihama \u2013 Channel 35\nHiratsuka \u2013 Channel 41\nOkinawa Prefecture\n\nKita-Daito \u2013 Channel 48\nMinami-Daito \u2013 Channel 60\n\nDigital\nJOEX-DTV \u2013 TV Asahi Digital Television (\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u671d\u65e5\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3)\n\nRemote controller ID 5\nTokyo Sky Tree \u2013 UHF Channel 24\nIbaraki Prefecture\n\nMito \u2013 Channel 17\nTochigi Prefecture\n\nUtsunomiya \u2013 Channel 17\nGunma Prefecture\n\nMaebashi \u2013 Channel 43\nKanagawa Prefecture\n\nHiratsuka \u2013 Channel 24\n\nHeadquarters\nIn 2003, the company headquarters moved to a new building designed by Fumihiko Maki currently located at 6-9-1 Roppongi, Minato, Tokyo, Japan.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nSome of TV Asahi's departments and subsidiaries, such as TV Asahi Productions and Take Systems, are still located at TV Asahi Center, the company's former headquarters from 1986 to 2003.

It is based on the 1956 novella of the same name by Shichir\u014d Fukazawa.

Weiler called the film \"an odd and colorful evocation of Japan's past that is only occasionally striking\", adding that it was \"stylized and occasionally graphic fare in the manner of the Kabuki Theatre\" and \"decidedly strange to Western tastes.\"\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times rated the film a maximum four stars, and added it to his Great Movies list in 2013, making it the final film he added to the list before his death.\n\nRestoration\nDuring the 2012 Cannes Film Festival, a digitally restored version of the film was screened out of competition, as part of the festival's Cannes Classics selections.\nIn his 2013 review of the Criterion Blu-ray release of the restored film, Jordan Cronk of Slant stated that Kinoshita, a \"less celebrated\" practitioner in the jidaigeki genre, used kabuki theater \"as a stylistic blueprint\" for his adaptation of the literary source, making it \"one of the era's most radical experiments\" which played \"more like a cinematic elegy than cosmetic theater.\"\n\nAwards\nThe Ballad of Narayama received three Mainichi Film Awards for Best Film, Best Director and Best Film Score.

(or simply Criterion) is an American home-video distribution company that focuses on licensing, restoring and distributing \"important classic and contemporary films\". A de facto subsidiary of arthouse film distributor Janus Films, Criterion serves film and media scholars, cinephiles and public and academic libraries. Criterion has helped to standardize certain aspects of home-video releases such as film restoration, the letterboxing format for widescreen films and the inclusion of bonus features such as scholarly essays and documentary content about the films and filmmakers. Criterion most notably pioneered the use of commentary tracks. Criterion has produced and distributed more than 1,000 special editions of its films in VHS, Betamax, LaserDisc, DVD, Blu-ray and Ultra HD Blu-ray formats and box sets. These films and their special features are also available via The Criterion Channel, an online streaming service that the company operates.\nThe Criterion Collection is considered a leading boutique Blu-ray label.\n\nHistory\nThe company was founded in 1984 by Robert Stein, Aleen Stein and Joe Medjuck, who later were joined by Roger Smith. In 1985, the Steins, William Becker and Jonathan B. Turell founded the Voyager Company to publish educational multimedia CD-ROMs (1989\u20132000), and the Criterion Collection became a subordinate division of the Voyager Company, with Janus Films holding a minority stake in the company, and decided to expand its product on videocassettes and videodiscs. In March 1994, Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck GmbH bought 20% of Voyager for US$6.7 million; the four founders each retained a 20% owner's share.\nIn 1997, the Voyager Company was dissolved (Aleen Stein founded the Organa LLC CD-ROM publishing company), and Holtzbrinck Publishers sold the Voyager brand name, 42 CD-ROM titles, the Voyager web site and associated assets to Learn Technologies Interactive, LLC (LTI). Stein sold 42 Voyager titles to LTI from his Voyager\/Criterion company share. The remaining three partners, Aleen Stein, Becker and Turell owned the Criterion Collection company, which has a business partnership with Janus Films and had one with Home Vision Entertainment (HVE) until 2005, when Image Entertainment bought HVE. On November 4, 2013, it was announced that Sony Pictures Home Entertainment would handle distribution. In May 2024, Janus Films and Criterion were acquired by Steven Rales.\n\nHome Vision Entertainment\nIn 1986, Charles Benton founded Home Vision Entertainment (HVE), the home-video division of Public Media Inc. (PMI), which he had previously founded in 1968. The HVE company sold, advertised, marketed and distributed Criterion Collection DVDs, and also sold its own HVE brand of DVDs (co-produced with Criterion), including The Merchant Ivory Collection and the Classic Collection, a joint venture between Home Vision Entertainment and Janus Films. The latter enterprise published HVE imprint films, for which Janus Films owned the video rights, but which were unavailable from the Criterion Collection; however, Criterion published the Classic Collection films. In 2005, Image Entertainment bought HVE making it the exclusive distributor of Criterion Collection products until 2013.\n\nOnline ventures and marketing\nThe Criterion Collection began to provide video-on-demand (VOD) in partnership with Mubi (formerly The Auteurs) in 2008. In February 2011, Criterion began switching its VOD offerings exclusively to Hulu Plus. In November 2016, FilmStruck, a film streaming service from Turner Classic Movies, succeeded Hulu as the exclusive streaming service for the Criterion Collection. Some Criterion films were streamed by Kanopy. On October 26, 2018, Warner Bros. Digital Networks and Turner announced that FilmStruck would shut down on November 29. Criterion stated in a blog post that it was \"trying to find ways we can bring our library and original content back to the digital space as soon as possible\".\nOn November 16, 2018, Criterion announced the launch of the Criterion Channel as a standalone service, wholly owned and operated by the Criterion Collection, in the United States and Canada. Some of the VOD service's offerings are also available on the Max streaming platform.\nBritish film magazine Sight & Sound revealed in its April 2016 issue that Criterion would be expanding its releases to the United Kingdom. The first six titles were released on April 18, 2016.\n\nContributions and influence\nThe Criterion Collection video company pioneered the correct aspect-ratio letterboxing presentation of films, as well as commentary soundtracks, multi-disc sets, special editions and definitive versions. These ideas and the special features introduced by the Criterion Collection have been highly influential, and have become industry-wide standards for premium home video releases.\n\nLetterboxing\nWith its eighth LaserDisc release, Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956), Criterion introduced the letterbox format, which added black bars to the top and bottom of the 4:3 standard television set in order to preserve the original aspect ratio of the film. Thereafter, Criterion made letterboxing the standard presentation for all its releases of films shot in widescreen aspect ratios.\n\nCommentary soundtracks\nThe Criterion Collection's second LaserDisc title, King Kong (1933), was the debut of the scene-specific audio commentary contained in a separate analog channel of the LaserDisc, in which American film historian Ronald Haver spoke about the production, cast, screenplay, production design and special effects. He also provides commentary on the LaserDisc editions of Casablanca (1942), Here Comes Mr. Jordan (1941), Singin' in the Rain (1952) and The Wizard of Oz (1939). Typically, the chapter-indexed commentaries are exclusive to the Criterion releases and their initial DVD reissues; they became collectors' items when the original studios reissued titles previously licensed to Criterion, regardless of whether new commentary tracks were produced.\n\nSpecial editions\nThe Criterion Collection began in 1984 with the releases of Citizen Kane (1941) and King Kong (1933) on LaserDisc, the latter's source negatives courtesy of the Library of Congress. The company later became known for pioneering the \"special edition\" DVD concept containing bonus materials such as trailers, commentaries, documentaries, alternate endings and deleted scenes. The success of these releases established the special-edition version in the DVD business. In 2006, taking advantage of advanced film-transfer and film-restoration technologies, Criterion published higher-quality versions, with bonus materials, of early catalog titles such as Amarcord (1973), Brazil (1985) and Seven Samurai (1954).\n\nFilm restoration\nOriginally, Criterion released art, genre and mainstream movies on LaserDisc such as Halloween (1978), Ghostbusters (1984), Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992), Armageddon (1998) and The Rock (1996). Increasingly, the Criterion Collection has also focused on releasing world cinema, mainstream cinema classics and critically successful obscure films. Using the best available source materials, the company produced technologically improved and cleaner versions, such as those for The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928), M (1931),  Children of Paradise (1945), The Third Man (1949), Seven Samurai (1954) and Amarcord (1973). Almost every title contains film-cleaning and film-restoration essays in the booklets, while some even have featurettes comparing the restored and unrestored images.\n\nLicenses\nSome previously licensed Criterion Collection titles, such as The Harder They Come (1972), are now commercially unavailable as new product, and are only available in resale (used) form. Titles such as RoboCop (1987), Hard Boiled (1992), The Killer (1989) and Ran (1985) became unavailable when their publishing licenses expired or when Criterion published improved versions, such as those for Beauty and the Beast (1946), M (1931), The Wages of Fear (1953) and Seven Samurai (1954). As of October 2023, over 200 of the 384 titles from the List of Criterion Collection Laserdisc releases have been re-released.\nAnother example is the film Charade (1963), which had become a public-domain property for lacking the legally-required copyright notice. Criterion produced a restored edition under license from Universal Pictures for the initial edition and for the later anamorphic widescreen re-release edition of the film.\nPeriodically, Criterion releases material on DVD and Blu-ray disc licensed from the studios with whom the company had previously dealt (such as Universal's and Terry Gilliam's 1985 film Brazil); these new releases are generally undertaken on a case-by-case basis.\nCriterion released its first Walt Disney Pictures title, Andrew Stanton's WALL-E, in 2022. This was not the result of an ongoing deal between Disney and Criterion, but rather licensed as a one-off, with Stanton approaching Criterion and \"wanting to be part of the club\".\n\nFormats\nAll Criterion titles are numbered, which is shown on the bottom of the spine of the packaging. Though the bulk of Criterion's catalog is of live-action films, they have also released animated films (Akira, Fantastic Planet, Fantastic Mr. Fox and WALL-E), television series (Tanner '88, Fishing with John and select episodes of I Love Lucy and The Addams Family) and music videos (Beastie Boys Video Anthology).\n\nLaserDisc and VHS\/Betamax\nThe Criterion Collection began publishing LaserDiscs on December 1, 1984, with its release of Citizen Kane, until March 16, 1999, with Michael Bay's Armageddon (#384). Three of the company's early titles (The 39 Steps, The Lady Vanishes and The Third Man) were also issued on VHS and Betamax. These were Criterion's only releases on those formats\u2014other Janus\/Criterion titles were often released to VHS through Home Vision Entertainment.\n\nDVD and Blu-ray\nCriterion entered the DVD market in 1998 with a reset numbering system, beginning with Seven Samurai, spine #2 (Grand Illusion, #1, was delayed for a year while restoration was underway on a then-newly-found camera negative.) As with its laserdiscs, Criterion's early DVD editions of widescreen films were presented in the letterbox format, but Criterion did not anamorphically enhance its discs for 16:9 monitors until mid-1999 with its release of Insomnia (#47).\nCriterion was slow to expand into high-definition releases, partly because of the HD format wars between Blu-ray and HD DVD. Once Blu-ray had emerged as the industry-standard high-definition home-video format, Criterion began to release Blu-ray editions of select films from its collection, beginning with the Blu-ray release of Wong Kar-wai's Chungking Express (#453; currently out of print) on December 16, 2008. In late 2013, Criterion announced that with the November release of the Zatoichi boxset (spine #679), all future releases would be in dual format (DVD and Blu-ray packaged together) rather than as individual releases. This decision also applied to most upgrade re-releases introduced after November 2013. After customer feedback revealed some reluctance to this approach, All That Jazz (#724) became the last chronological spine number released as a dual-format edition, and the decision was reversed to release separate discs for titles beginning in September 2014.\nDespite the emergence of Blu-ray as the industry-standard high-definition format, Janus\/Criterion continues to support the DVD format. Not only are all their new Blu-ray releases accompanied by a standard-definition DVD version, but revised and upgraded releases are also released on both formats (barring the brief foray into dual-format releases). Moreover, the company's standalone line of Eclipse releases are currently only made available in the standard DVD format.\nAside from the core catalog, the company has also released films through its Essential Art House, Eclipse, Merchant Ivory and Janus Contemporaries lines, as well as a few releases outside of any product line. Many of these releases have also been collected and sold in various box sets.\n\nIn early 2016 for the first time in its history, Criterion announced it would begin releasing its catalogue outside of the US and Canada (earlier international Criterion titles such as the Japanese LaserDisc of Blade Runner were licensed to other companies). In partnership with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, releases began to be distributed with the launch of six titles in the U.K. during the month.\nCriterion's DVD releases are a mixture of NTSC-standard Region 0 (region-free) and Region 1 DVDs. Blu-ray discs are Region A-locked in North America or Region B-locked in the United Kingdom (though there are exceptions). However, when SPHE stopped distributing Criterion's releases in the UK, the distribution moved to Spirit Entertainment.\n\nUltra HD Blu-ray\nOn August 11, 2021, Criterion announced that it would begin publishing titles in Ultra HD Blu-ray format in November 2021. All Criterion Ultra HD Blu-ray releases will include both an Ultra HD Blu-ray copy and a regular Blu-ray copy of a film (with all the special features on the regular Blu-ray), with select releases including Dolby Vision HDR and Dolby Atmos. The first such releases were announced on August 16 for a November 21 release: Citizen Kane (#1104, returning to the collection for the first time since 1992), Mulholland Drive and Menace II Society. The company also released The Red Shoes, A Hard Day's Night and The Piano on Ultra HD Blu-ray disc. The film Uncut Gems (#1101), which was previously planned for Blu-ray and DVD release in October 2021, was delayed until November in order to also give the film an Ultra HD Blu-ray release.\n\nStreaming as The Criterion Channel\nAfter forays in providing titles from the Collection as streaming video-on-demand (VOD) in partnership with other companies \u2013 Mubi (formerly The Auteurs, 2008), Hulu Plus (2011\u20132016) and TCM's FilmStruck (2016\u20132018) \u2013 Criterion titles found themselves without an online home when FilmStruck announced it would be shutting down on November 29, 2018. The company stated in a blog post that it was \"trying to find ways we can bring our library and original content back to the digital space as soon as possible\".\nA month later, Criterion announced their own standalone subscription service, The Criterion Channel available to subscribers in the United States and Canada. The service began on April 8, 2019. The Channel's offerings include rotating playlists, temporarily licensed films (and some television offerings) from a variety of studios and rights holders alongside streaming editions of Criterion Collection releases replete with special features. The Channel also hosts some original content, including academic overviews and curated introductions as well as featuring some Janus-owned titles that have yet to be released on physical media. Criterion maintains a close relationship with Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming platform Max, which frequently also houses Criterion-released titles.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nCriterion Collection \u2013 official site\nCriterion Channel \u2013 official site\nCriterion Collection at Blu-ray.com\nCriterion Collection at NPR\nCriterion Collection titles on Netflix Instant Watch at MUBI\nThe Criterion Collection's channel on YouTube\nCriterion Origin History (video; 15:45) on YouTube\nCriterion Supercut (1190 titles; May 2023) (video; 23:45) on YouTube","191":"The Daily Telegraph, known online and elsewhere as The Telegraph, is a British daily broadsheet newspaper published in London by Telegraph Media Group and distributed in the United Kingdom and internationally. It was founded by Arthur B. Sleigh in 1855 as The Daily Telegraph and Courier. The Telegraph is considered a newspaper of record. The paper's motto, \"Was, is, and will be\", was included in its emblem which was used for over a century starting in 1858.\nIts sister paper, The Sunday Telegraph, which started in 1961, had a circulation of 281,025 as of December 2018. The two sister newspapers are run separately, with different editorial staff, but there is cross-usage of stories. It is now politically conservative and supports the Conservative Party. It was politically moderately liberal before the late 1870s.\nThe Telegraph has had a number of news scoops, including the outbreak of World War II by rookie reporter Clare Hollingworth, described as \"the scoop of the century\", the 2009 parliamentary expenses scandal \u2013 which led to a number of high-profile political resignations and for which it was named 2009 British Newspaper of the Year \u2013 its 2016 undercover investigation on the England football manager Sam Allardyce, and the Lockdown Files in 2023.\n\nHistory\nFounding and early history\nThe Daily Telegraph and Courier was founded by Colonel Arthur B. Sleigh in June 1855 to air a personal grievance against the future commander-in-chief of the British Army, Prince George, Duke of Cambridge. Joseph Moses Levy, the owner of The Sunday Times, agreed to print the newspaper, and the first edition was published on 29 June 1855. The paper cost 2d and was four pages long. Nevertheless, the first edition stressed the quality and independence of its articles and journalists: \"We shall be guided by a high tone of independent action.\" As the paper was not a success, Sleigh was unable to pay Levy the printing bill.\nLevy took over the newspaper, his aim being to produce a cheaper newspaper than his main competitors in London, the Daily News and The Morning Post, to expand the size of the overall market. Levy appointed his son, Edward Levy-Lawson, Lord Burnham, and Thornton Leigh Hunt to edit the newspaper. Lord Burnham relaunched the paper as The Daily Telegraph, with the slogan \"the largest, best, and cheapest newspaper in the world\". Hunt laid out the newspaper's principles in a memorandum sent to Levy: \"We should report all striking events in science, so told that the intelligent public can understand what has happened and can see its bearing on our daily life and our future. The same principle should apply to all other events\u2014to fashion, to new inventions, to new methods of conducting business\".\nIn 1876, Jules Verne published his novel Michael Strogoff, whose plot takes place during a fictional uprising and war in Siberia. Verne included among the book's characters a war correspondent of The Daily Telegraph, named Harry Blount\u2014who is depicted as an exceptionally dedicated, resourceful and brave journalist, taking great personal risks to follow closely the ongoing war and bring accurate news of it to The Telegraph's readership, ahead of competing papers.\n\n1901 to 1945\nIn 1908, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany gave a controversial interview to The Daily Telegraph that severely damaged Anglo-German relations and added to international tensions in the build-up to World War I. In 1928, the son of Baron Burnham, Harry Lawson Webster Levy-Lawson, 2nd Baron Burnham, sold the paper to William Berry, 1st Viscount Camrose, in partnership with his brother Gomer Berry, 1st Viscount Kemsley and Edward Iliffe, 1st Baron Iliffe.\nIn 1937, the newspaper absorbed The Morning Post, which traditionally espoused a conservative position and sold predominantly amongst the retired officer class. Originally William Ewart Berry, 1st Viscount Camrose, bought The Morning Post with the intention of publishing it alongside The Daily Telegraph, but poor sales of the former led him to merge the two. For some years, the paper was retitled The Daily Telegraph and Morning Post before it reverted to just The Daily Telegraph. \nIn the late 1930s, Victor Gordon Lennox, The Telegraph's diplomatic editor, published an anti-appeasement private newspaper The Whitehall Letter that received much of its information from leaks from Sir Robert Vansittart, the Permanent Under-Secretary of the Foreign Office, and Rex Leeper, the Foreign Office's Press Secretary. As a result, Gordon Lennox was monitored by MI5. In 1939, The Telegraph published Clare Hollingworth's scoop that Germany was to invade Poland.\nIn November 1940, Fleet Street, with its close proximity to the river and docklands, was subjected to almost daily bombing raids by the Luftwaffe and The Telegraph started printing in Manchester at Kemsley House (now The Printworks entertainment venue), which was run by Camrose's brother Kemsley. Manchester quite often printed the entire run of The Telegraph when its Fleet Street offices were under threat. The name Kemsley House was changed to Thomson House in 1959. In 1986, printing of Northern editions of the Daily and Sunday Telegraph moved to Trafford Park and in 2008 to Newsprinters at Knowsley, Liverpool.\nDuring the Second World War, The Daily Telegraph covertly helped in the recruitment of code-breakers for Bletchley Park. The ability to solve The Telegraph's crossword in under 12 minutes was considered to be a recruitment test. The newspaper was asked to organise a crossword competition, after which each of the successful participants was contacted and asked if they would be prepared to undertake \"a particular type of work as a contribution to the war effort\". The competition itself was won by F. H. W. Hawes of Dagenham who finished the crossword in less than eight minutes.\n\n1946 to 1985\nBoth the Camrose (Berry) and Burnham (Levy-Lawson) families remained involved in management until Conrad Black took control in 1986. On the death of his father in 1954, Seymour Berry, 2nd Viscount Camrose assumed the chairmanship of the Daily Telegraph with his brother Michael Berry, Baron Hartwell as his editor-in-chief. During this period, the company saw the launch of sister paper The Sunday Telegraph in 1960.\n\n1986 to 2004\nCanadian businessman Conrad Black, through companies controlled by him, bought the Telegraph Group in 1986. Black, through his holding company Ravelston Corporation, owned 78% of Hollinger Inc. which in turn owned 30% of Hollinger International. Hollinger International in turn owned the Telegraph Group and other publications such as the Chicago Sun-Times, the Jerusalem Post and The Spectator.\nOn 18 January 2004, Black was dismissed as chairman of the Hollinger International board over allegations of financial wrongdoing. Black was also sued by the company. Later that day, it was reported that the Barclay brothers had agreed to purchase Black's 78% interest in Hollinger Inc. for \u00a3245m, giving them a controlling interest in the company, and to buy out the minority shareholders later. However, a lawsuit was filed by the Hollinger International board to try to block Black from selling his shares in Hollinger Inc. until an investigation into his dealings was completed. Black filed a countersuit but, eventually, United States judge Leo Strine sided with the Hollinger International board and blocked Black from selling his Hollinger Inc. shares to the twins.\nOn 7 March 2004, the twins announced that they were launching another bid, this time just for The Daily Telegraph and its Sunday sister paper rather than all of Hollinger Inc. The then owner of the Daily Express, Richard Desmond, was also interested in purchasing the paper, selling his interest in several pornographic magazines to finance the initiative. Desmond withdrew in March 2004, when the price climbed above \u00a3600m, as did Daily Mail and General Trust plc a few months later on 17 June.\n\nSince 2004\nIn November 2004, The Telegraph celebrated the tenth anniversary of its website, Electronic Telegraph, now renamed www.telegraph.co.uk. The Electronic Telegraph launched in 1995 with The Daily Telegraph Guide to the Internet by writer Sue Schofield for an annual charge of \u00a3180.00. On 8 May 2006, the first stage of a major redesign of the website took place, with a wider page layout and greater prominence for audio, video and journalist blogs.\nOn 10 October 2005, The Daily Telegraph relaunched to incorporate a tabloid sports section and a new standalone business section. The Daily Mail's star columnist and political analyst Simon Heffer left that paper in October 2005 to rejoin The Daily Telegraph, where he has become associate editor. Heffer has written two columns a week for the paper since late October 2005 and is a regular contributor to the news podcast. In November 2005, the first regular podcast service by a newspaper in the UK was launched. Just before Christmas 2005, it was announced that The Telegraph titles would be moving from Canada Place in Canary Wharf, to new offices at Victoria Plaza at 111 Buckingham Palace Road near Victoria Station in central London. The new office features a \"hub and spoke\" layout for the newsroom to produce content for print and online editions.\nIn October 2006, with its relocation to Victoria, the company was renamed the Telegraph Media Group, repositioning itself as a multimedia company. On 2 September 2008, the Daily Telegraph was printed with colour on each page for the first time when it left Westferry for Newsprinters at Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, another arm of the Murdoch company. The paper is also printed in Liverpool and Glasgow by Newsprinters. In May 2009, the daily and Sunday editions published details of MPs' expenses. This led to a number of high-profile resignations from both the ruling Labour administration and the Conservative opposition.\nIn June 2014, The Telegraph was criticised by Private Eye for its policy of replacing experienced journalists and news managers with less-experienced staff and search engine optimisers.\nOn 26 October 2019, the Financial Times reported that the Barclay Brothers were about to put the Telegraph Media Group up for sale. The Financial Times also reported that the Daily Mail and General Trust (owner of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday, Metro and Ireland on Sunday) would be interested in buying.\nThe Daily Telegraph supported Liz Truss in the July\u2013September 2022 Conservative Party leadership election.\nIn July 2023, it was announced that Lloyds Banking Group had appointed Mike McTighe as chairman of Press Acquisitions Limited and May Corporation Limited in order to spearhead the sale of The Telegraph and The Spectator.\n\nAccusation of news coverage influence by advertisers\nIn July 2014, the Daily Telegraph was criticised for carrying links on its website to pro-Kremlin articles supplied by a Russian state-funded publication that downplayed any Russian involvement in the downing of the passenger jet Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. These had featured on its website as part of a commercial deal, but were later removed.\nAs of 2014, the paper was paid \u00a3900,000 a year to include the supplement Russia Beyond the Headlines, a publication sponsored by the Rossiyskaya Gazeta, the Russian government's official newspaper.\nIn February 2015, the chief political commentator of the Daily Telegraph, Peter Oborne, resigned. Oborne accused the paper of a \"form of fraud on its readers\" for its coverage of the bank HSBC in relation to a Swiss tax-dodging scandal that was widely covered by other news media. He alleged that editorial decisions about news content had been heavily influenced by the advertising arm of the newspaper because of commercial interests. Jay Rosen at New York University stated that Oborne's resignation statement was \"one of the most important things a journalist has written about journalism lately\".\nOborne cited other instances of advertising strategy influencing the content of articles, linking the refusal to take an editorial stance on the repression of democratic demonstrations in Hong Kong to the Telegraph's support from China. Additionally, he said that favourable reviews of the Cunard cruise liner Queen Mary II appeared in the Telegraph, noting: \"On 10 May last year The Telegraph ran a long feature on Cunard's Queen Mary II liner on the news review page. This episode looked to many like a plug for an advertiser on a page normally dedicated to serious news analysis. I again checked and certainly Telegraph competitors did not view Cunard's liner as a major news story. Cunard is an important Telegraph advertiser.\"\nIn response, the Telegraph called Oborne's statement an \"astonishing and unfounded attack, full of inaccuracy and innuendo\". Later that month, Telegraph editor Chris Evans invited journalists at the newspaper to contribute their thoughts on the issue. Press Gazette reported later in 2015 that Oborne had joined the Daily Mail tabloid newspaper and The Telegraph had \"issued new guidelines over the way editorial and commercial staff work together\".\nIn January 2017, the Telegraph Media Group had a higher number of upheld complaints than any other UK newspaper by its regulator IPSO. Most of these findings pertained to inaccuracy, as with other UK newspapers.\nIn October 2017, a number of major western news organisations whose coverage had irked Beijing were excluded from Xi Jinping's speech event launching a new politburo. However, the Daily Telegraph had been granted an invitation to the event.\nIn April 2019, Business Insider reported The Telegraph had partnered with Facebook to publish articles \"downplaying 'technofears' and praising the company\".\n\nPremature obituaries\nThe paper published premature obituaries for Cockie Hoogterp, the second wife of Baron Blixen, Dave Swarbrick in 1999, and Dorothy Southworth Ritter, the widow of Tex Ritter and mother of John Ritter, in August 2001.\n\nAccusation of antisemitism\nEditors for both the Daily Telegraph and the Sunday Telegraph have been criticised by Guardian columnist Owen Jones for publishing and authoring articles which espouse an antisemitic conspiracy theory. In 2018, Allister Heath, the editor of the Sunday Telegraph wrote that \"Cultural Marxism is running rampant.\" Assistant comment editor of the Daily Telegraph Sherelle Jacobs also used the term in 2019. The Daily Telegraph also published an anonymous civil servant who stated: \"There is a strong presence of Anglophobia, combined with cultural Marxism that runs through the civil service.\"\n\nFalse allegations of Islamic extremism\nIn January 2019, the paper published an article written by Camilla Tominey titled \"Police called in after Scout group run from mosque is linked to Islamic extremist and Holocaust denier\" in which it was reported that the police were investigating Ahammed Hussain, the Leader of the Scout Group at the Lewisham Islamic Centre, because he had links to extremist Muslim groups that promoted terrorism and antisemitism.\nIn January 2020, the paper issued an official apology and accepted that the article contained many falsehoods, and that Hussain had never supported or promoted terrorism, or been antisemitic. The paper paid Hussain damages and costs. In a letter sent to Hussain's lawyers accompanying the text of their published apology, the newspaper's lawyers wrote: \"The article was published by our client following receipt of information in good faith from the Scout Association and the Henry Jackson Society; nevertheless our client now accepts that the article (using that expression to refer to both print and online versions) is defamatory of your client and will apologise to him for publishing it.\"\n\nChina Watch\nIn 2016, the Hong Kong Free Press reported that The Daily Telegraph was receiving \u00a3750,000 annually to carry a supplement called 'China Watch' as part of a commercial deal with Chinese state-run newspaper China Daily. The Guardian reported in 2018 that the China Watch supplement was being carried by The Telegraph along with other newspapers of record such as The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and Le Figaro. The Telegraph published the supplement once a month in print, and published it online at least until March 2020.\nIn April 2020, The Telegraph removed China Watch from its website, along with another advertisement feature section by Chinese state-run media outlet People's Daily Online. The paper had run many pieces critical of China since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCOVID-19 misinformation\nIn January 2021, the British press regulator, the Independent Press Standards Organisation, ordered The Daily Telegraph to publish a correction to two \"significantly misleading\" claims in a comment article published by Toby Young. The July 2020 article \"When we have herd immunity Boris will face a reckoning on this pointless and damaging lockdown,\" which spread COVID-19 misinformation that the common cold provided \"natural immunity\" to COVID-19 and that London was \"probably approaching herd immunity\". The regulator said that a correction was appropriate rather than a more serious response due to the level of scientific uncertainty at the time the comment was published. At the time of the ruling, the Telegraph had removed the comment article but had not issued a correction.\n\nClimate change\nThe Telegraph has published multiple columns and news articles which promote pseudoscientific views on climate change, and misleadingly cast the subject of climate change as a subject of active scientific debate when there is a scientific consensus on climate change. It has published columns about the \"conspiracy behind the Anthropogenic Global Warming myth\", described climate scientists as \"white-coated prima donnas and narcissists,\" and claimed that \"global warming causes about as much damage as benefits.\" In 2015, a Telegraph news article incorrectly claimed that scientists predicted a mini-ice age by 2030. Climate change denying journalist James Delingpole was first to use \"Climategate\" on his Telegraph blog for a manufactured controversy where emails were leaked from climate scientists ahead of the Copenhagen climate summit and misleadingly presented to give the appearance that the climate scientists were engaged in fraud.\nIn 2014, The Telegraph was one of several media titles to give evidence to the House of Commons Select Committee 'Communicating climate science'. The paper told MPs they believe climate change is happening and humans play a role in it. Editors told the committee, \"we believe that the climate is changing, that the reason for that change includes human activity, but that human ingenuity and adaptability should not be ignored in favour of economically damaging prescriptions.\"\nIn November 2023, the journalist and climate activist group DeSmog published its judgments for coverage of environmental topics in 171 of The Telegraph's opinion pieces from April to October 2023. DeSmog stated that of these 171 pieces, 85 per cent were categorized as \"anti-green\", defined as \"attacking climate policy, questioning climate science and ridiculing environmental groups.\"\n\nOwen Paterson\nThe Daily Telegraph, in particular its columnist and former editor Charles Moore, were staunch supporters of Owen Paterson, a former MP and minister who resigned after it was found that he had breached advocacy rules to lobby ministers for fees. A plan to overhaul the Commons standard and spare Paterson from being suspended and a possible recall petition that follows was leaked to the newspaper and it was \"approvingly\" splashed across the paper's front page. Boris Johnson flew back from the COP 26 summit in Glasgow to attend a Telegraph journalists' reunion at the Garrick and was seen to leave the club with Moore the same evening.\n\n2023\u20132024 takeover bid\nIn June 2023, The Guardian and other newspapers reported that, following a breakdown in discussions relating to a financial dispute, Lloyds Bank was planning to take control of the companies owning the Telegraph titles and the Spectator and sell them off. Representatives of the Barclay family have described the reports as \"irresponsible\". By 20 October, a sale of the publications had been initiated after bankers seized control. Lloyds appointed receivers and started shopping the brands to bidders.\nBy November, it was revealed that the bid had been agreed upon by RedBird IMI, a joint venture between RedBird Capital Partners and International Media Investments, a firm based in the United Arab Emirates and owned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The bid would see the firm take over The Telegraph, while allowing the Barclay family to repay a debt of \u00a31.2 billion to Lloyds Bank. Conservative MPs raised national security concerns, and pushed the government to investigate into the bid, as the United Arab Emirates had a poor reputation for freedom of speech. Culture secretary Lucy Frazer issued a public interest intervention notice on 30 November, preventing the group from taking over without further scrutiny from the media regulator Ofcom over potential breaches of media standards. Conservative MPs also called on Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden to use the National Security and Investment Act 2021 to investigate the Emirati-backed bid.\nChairman Andrew Neil threatened to quit if the sale was approved, saying \"You cannot have a major mainstream newspaper group owned by an undemocratic government or dictatorship where no one has a vote.\" Fraser Nelson, editor of The Spectator, which would be included in the sale, also opposed the move, saying, \"the very reason why a foreign government would want to buy a sensitive asset is the very reason why a national government should be wary of selling them.\"\nIn March 2024, the Lords voted in a new law, under which restrictions were imposed on foreign governments regarding the ownership of British newspapers and magazines, including only being allowed up to a 0.1 per cent stake. In April 2024, the UK government effectively banned RedBird IMI from taking over The Telegraph and The Spectator by introducing new laws which prevented foreign governments from owning British newspapers. RedBird also confirmed it would withdraw its takeover plans, saying they were \"no longer feasible\".\n\nCirculation\nIt had a circulation of 270,000 in 1856, and 240,000 in 1863. It had a circulation of 1,393,094 in 1968, and 1,358,875 in 1978. It had a circulation of 1,439,000 in 1980, and 1,235,000 in 1984. It had a circulation of 1,133,173 in 1988. The paper had a circulation of 363,183 in December 2018, not including bulk sales. It descended further until it withdrew from newspaper circulation audits in 2020. The bulk of its readership has  moved online; the Telegraph Media Group reported a subscription number of 1,035,710 for December 2023, composed of 117,586 for its print edition, 688,012 for its digital version and 230,112 for other subscriptions.\n\nPolitical stance\nThe Daily Telegraph supported Whig, and moderate liberal ideas, before the late 1870s. The Daily Telegraph is politically conservative and has endorsed the Conservative Party at every UK general election since 1945. The personal links between the paper's editors and the leadership of the Conservative Party, along with the paper's generally right-wing stance and influence over Conservative activists, have led the paper commonly to be referred to, especially in Private Eye, as the Torygraph.\nWhen the Barclay brothers purchased the Telegraph Group for around \u00a3665 million in late June 2004, Sir David Barclay suggested that The Daily Telegraph might no longer be the \"house newspaper\" of the Conservatives in the future. In an interview with The Guardian, he said: \"Where the government are right we shall support them.\" The editorial board endorsed the Conservative Party in the 2005 general election. During the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, the paper supported the Better Together 'No' Campaign. Alex Salmond, the former leader of the SNP, called The Telegraph \"extreme\" on Question Time in September 2015. In the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, it endorsed voting to leave the EU.\nIn December 2015, The Daily Telegraph was fined \u00a330,000 in 2015 for \"sending an unsolicited email to hundreds of thousands of its subscribers, urging them to vote for the Conservatives.\" During the 2019 Conservative Party leadership election, The Daily Telegraph endorsed their former columnist Boris Johnson. In 2019, former columnist Graham Norton, who had left the paper in late 2018, said \"about a year before I left, it took a turn\" and criticised it for \"toxic\" political stances, namely for a piece defending US Supreme Court then-nominee Brett Kavanaugh and for being \"a mouthpiece for Boris Johnson\" whose columns were allegedly published with \"no fact-checking at all\".\n\nLGBT+ rights\nIn 2012, prior to the legalisation of same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom, Telegraph View published an editorial stating that it was a \"pointless distraction\" as \"many [gay couples] already avail themselves of the civil partnerships introduced by Labour\". The Telegraph wrote in another editorial that same year that it feared that changing \"the law on gay marriage risks inflaming anti-homosexual bigotry\".\nIn 2015, the newspaper published an article by former editor Charles Moore claiming a \"gay rights sharia\" was dictating what the LGBT+ community should believe, following Dolce & Gabbana's openly gay founders criticising gay adoptions. Moore wrote: \"If you are gay, Mr Strudwick seemed to assert, there are certain things you must believe. Nothing else is permitted under the gay rights sharia.\" Moore has previously expressed his views that civil partnerships achieved a \"balance\" for heterosexual and homosexual couples. In 2013, he wrote: \"Respectable people are truly terrified of being thought anti-homosexual. In a way, they are right to be, because attacking people for their personal preferences can be a nasty thing.\"\nAlso in 2015, The Telegraph published its \"Out at Work\" list, naming \"the top 50 list of LGBT executives\". Since then, The Telegraph appeared to shift towards a more liberal attitude on LGBT+ issues, publishing articles that then-Prime Minister Theresa May needed to be \"serious about LGBT equality\" and that \"bathroom bills\" in Texas \u2013 which were criticised as being transphobic \u2013 were \"a Kafkaesque state intrusion\". The newspaper also featured an article written by Maria Munir about their experience coming out to President Barack Obama as non-binary. Stonewall CEO Ruth Hunt penned an article in The Telegraph after the Orlando nightclub shooting in June 2016 that the attack on a gay nightclub \"grew out of everyday homophobia\".\nAlso in 2016, Telegraph Executive Director Lord Black was awarded Peer of the Year at the 2016 PinkNews Awards for his campaigning on LGBT rights. The Telegraph has published articles which have been criticised by PinkNews as transphobic. In 2017, the newspaper published an article by Allison Pearson titled: \"Will our spineless politicians' love affair with LGBT ever end?\", arguing that NHS patients' being asked their sexual orientation was unnecessary and another in 2018 with the headline: \"The tyranny of the transgender minority has got to be stopped.\"\n\nSister publications\nThe Sunday Telegraph\nThe Daily Telegraph's sister Sunday paper was founded in 1961. The writer Sir Peregrine Worsthorne is probably the best known journalist associated with the title (1961\u20131997), eventually being editor for three years from 1986. In 1989, the Sunday title was briefly merged into a seven-day operation under Max Hastings's overall control. In 2005, the paper was revamped, with Stella being added to the more traditional television and radio section. It costs \u00a32.20 and includes separate Money, Living, Sport and Business supplements.\nCirculation of The Sunday Telegraph in July 2010 was 505,214 (ABC).\n\nYoung Telegraph\nYoung Telegraph was a weekly section of The Daily Telegraph published as a 14-page supplement in the weekend edition of the newspaper. Young Telegraph featured a mixture of news, features, cartoon strips and product reviews aimed at 8\u201312-year-olds. It was edited by Damien Kelleher (1993\u20131997) and Kitty Melrose (1997\u20131999). Launched in 1990, the award-winning supplement also ran original serialised stories featuring popular brands such as Young Indiana Jones and the British children's sitcom Maid Marian and Her Merry Men. It featured the cartoon \"Mad Gadget\" by Chris Winn, and a computer game \"Mad Gadget: Lost In Time\" (1993) and a book \"Mad Gadget: Gadget Mad\" (1995) were produced.\nIn 1995, an interactive spin-off called Electronic Young Telegraph (EYT) was launched on floppy disk. Described as an interactive computer magazine for children, Electronic Young Telegraph was edited by Adam Tanswell, who led the relaunch of the product on CD-Rom in 1998. Electronic Young Telegraph featured original content including interactive quizzes, informative features and computer games, as well as entertainment news and reviews. It was later re-branded as T:Drive in 1999.\n\nWebsite\nTelegraph.co.uk is the online version of the newspaper. It uses the banner title The Telegraph and includes articles from the print editions of The Daily Telegraph and The Sunday Telegraph, as well as web-only content such as breaking news, features, picture galleries and blogs. It was named UK Consumer Website of the Year in 2007 and Digital Publisher of the year in 2009 by the Association of Online Publishers. The site is overseen by Kate Day, digital director of Telegraph Media Group. Other staff include Shane Richmond, head of technology (editorial), and Ian Douglas, head of digital production. In November 2012, international customers accessing the Telegraph.co.uk site would have to sign up for a subscription package. Visitors had access to 20 free articles a month before having to subscribe for unlimited access. In March 2013, the pay meter system was also rolled out in the UK.\nThe site, which has been the focus of the group's efforts to create an integrated news operation producing content for print and online from the same newsroom, completed a relaunch during 2008 involving the use of the Escenic content management system, popular among northern European and Scandinavian newspaper groups. Telegraph TV is a Video on Demand service run by The Daily Telegraph and the Sunday Telegraph. It is hosted on The Telegraph's website, telegraph.co.uk. Telegraph.co.uk became the most popular UK newspaper site in April 2008. It was overtaken by Guardian.co.uk in April 2009 and later by \"Mail Online\". In December 2010, \"Telegraph.co.uk\" was the third most visited British newspaper website with 1.7 million daily browsers compared to 2.3 million for \"Guardian.co.uk\" and nearly 3 million for \"Mail Online\". In October 2023, \"Telegraph.co.uk\" was the tenth most visited UK newspaper site, with 13.8 million monthly visits, compared to the most popular, the BBC, with 38.3 million.\n\nHistory\nThe website was launched, under the name electronic telegraph at midday on 15 November 1994 at the headquarters of The Daily Telegraph at Canary Wharf in London Docklands with Ben Rooney as its first editor. It was Europe's first daily web-based newspaper. At this time, the modern internet was still in its infancy, with as few as 10,000 websites estimated to have existed at the time \u2013 compared to more than 100 billion by 2009. In 1994, only around 1% of the British population (some 600,000 people) had internet access at home, compared to more than 80% in 2009.\nInitially, the site published only the top stories from the print edition of the newspaper but it gradually increased its coverage until virtually all of the newspaper was carried online and the website was also publishing original material. The website, hosted on a Sun Microsystems Sparc 20 server and connected via a 64 kbit\/s leased line from Demon Internet, was edited by Ben Rooney.\nAn early coup for the site was the publication of articles by Ambrose Evans-Pritchard on Bill Clinton and the Whitewater controversy. The availability of the articles online brought a large American audience to the site. In 1997, the Clinton administration issued a 331-page report that accused Evans-Pritchard of peddling \"right-wing inventions\". Derek Bishton, who by then had succeeded Rooney as editor, later wrote: \"In the days before ET it would have been highly unlikely that anyone in the US would have been aware of Evans-Pritchard's work \u2013 and certainly not to the extent that the White House would be forced to issue such a lengthy rebuttal.\" Bishton, who later became consulting editor for Telegraph Media Group, was followed as editor by Richard Burton, who was made redundant in August 2006. Edward Roussel replaced Burton.\n\nMy Telegraph\nMy Telegraph offers a platform for readers to have their own blog, save articles, and network with other readers. Launched in May 2007, My Telegraph won a Cross Media Award from international newspaper organisation IFRA in October 2007. One of the judges, Robert Cauthorn, described the project as \"the best deployment of blogging yet seen in any newspaper anywhere in the world\".\n\nNotable stories\nIn December 2010, Telegraph reporters posing as constituents secretly recorded Business Secretary Vince Cable. In an undisclosed part of the transcript given to the BBC's Robert Peston by a whistleblower unhappy that The Telegraph had not published Cable's comments in full, Cable stated in reference to Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation takeover bid for BSkyB, \"I have declared war on Mr Murdoch and I think we are going to win.\" Following this revelation, Cable had his responsibility for media affairs \u2013 including ruling on Murdoch's takeover plans \u2013 withdrawn from his role as business secretary.\nIn May 2011, the Press Complaints Commission upheld a complaint regarding The Telegraph's use of subterfuge: \"On this occasion, the commission was not convinced that the public interest was such as to justify proportionately this level of subterfuge.\" In July 2011, a firm of private investigators hired by The Telegraph to track the source of the leak concluded \"strong suspicion\" that two former Telegraph employees who had moved to News International, one of them Will Lewis, had gained access to the transcript and audio files and leaked them to Peston.\n\n2009 MP expenses scandal\nIn May 2009, The Daily Telegraph obtained a full copy of all the expenses claims of British Members of Parliament. The Telegraph began publishing, in instalments from 8 May 2009, certain MPs' expenses. The Telegraph justified the publication of the information because it contended that the official information due to be released would have omitted key information about redesignating of second-home nominations. This led to a number of high-profile resignations from both the ruling Labour administration and the Conservative opposition.\n\n2016 Sam Allardyce investigation\nIn September 2016, Telegraph reporters posing as businessmen filmed England manager Sam Allardyce, offering to give advice on how to get around on FA rules on player third party ownership and negotiating a \u00a3400,000 deal. The investigation saw Allardyce leave his job by mutual consent on 27 September and making the statement \"entrapment has won\".\n\nReception and historical value\nDenise Bates included The Daily Telegraph in a list of national newspapers which, because of the quality of their reporting, or the extent of their audience, stand out and are likely to be used for historical research. The editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica said that The Daily Telegraph has consistently had a \"high standard of reporting\". The Daily Telegraph was renowned for its foreign correspondents. According to the DNCJ, during the nineteenth century The Daily Telegraph had excellent coverage of the arts. In 1989, Nicholas and Erbach said The Daily Telegraph is factually accurate, and that its reputation for being so extends outside the country.\n\nAwards\nThe Daily Telegraph has been named the National Newspaper of the Year in 2009, 1996 and 1993, while The Sunday Telegraph won the same award in 1999. Its investigation on the 2009 expenses scandal was named the \"Scoop of the Year\" in 2009, with William Lewis winning \"Journalist of the Year\". The Telegraph won \"Team of the Year\" in 2004 for its coverage of the Iraq War. The paper also won \"Columnist of the Year\" three years' running from 2002 to 2004: Zo\u00eb Heller (2002), Robert Harris (2003) and Boris Johnson (2004).\n\nCharity and fundraising work\nIn 1979, following a letter in The Daily Telegraph and a Government report highlighting the shortfall in care available for premature babies, Bliss, the special care baby charity, was founded. In 2009, as part of the Bliss 30th birthday celebrations, the charity was chosen as one of four beneficiaries of the newspaper's Christmas Charity Appeal. In February 2010, a cheque was presented to Bliss for \u00a3120,000.\nIn 2014, The Telegraph designed a Newspaper-themed Paddington Bear statue, one of fifty located around London prior to the release of the film Paddington, which was auctioned to raise funds for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC).\n\nNotable people\nEditors\nNotable columnists and journalists\nSee also\nList of the oldest newspapers\nHistory of journalism\nNewspaper of record\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nBurnham, E.

She is characterized as self-absorbed and uninterested in her husband's struggles, unless they directly affect her.\nGerasim is the Golovins' young butler. He takes on the role of sole comforter and caretaker during Ivan's illness.\nPyotr Ivanovich is Ivan's longtime friend and colleague. He studied law with Ivan and is the first to recognize Ivan's impending death.\nVasia is Ivan's son.\nLisa is Ivan's daughter.\nPetrishchev is Lisa's fianc\u00e9.\n\nPlot summary\nIvan Ilyich lives a carefree life that is \"most simple and most ordinary and therefore most terrible.\" Like everyone he knows, he spends his life climbing the social ladder. Enduring marriage to a woman whom he often finds too demanding, he works his way up to be a magistrate, thanks to the influence he has over a friend who has just been promoted, focusing more on his work as his family life becomes less tolerable.\nWhile hanging curtains for his new home one day, he falls awkwardly and hurts his side. Though he does not think much of it at first, he begins to suffer from a pain in his side. As his discomfort grows, his behavior towards his family becomes more irritable. His wife finally insists that he visit a physician. The physician cannot pinpoint the source of his malady, but soon it becomes clear that his condition is terminal (although no diagnosis is ever stated by the physician.) Confronted with his terminal condition, Ivan attempts every remedy he can to obtain a cure for his worsening situation, until the pain grows so intense that he is forced to cease working and spend the remainder of his days in bed. Here, he is brought face to face with his mortality and realizes that, although he knows of it, he does not truly grasp it.\nDuring the long and painful process of dying, Ivan dwells on the idea that he does not deserve his suffering because he has lived rightly. If he had not lived a good life, there could be a reason for his pain; but he has, so pain and death must be arbitrary and senseless. As he begins to hate his family for avoiding the subject of his death, for pretending he is only sick and not dying, he finds his only comfort in his peasant boy servant, Gerasim, the only person in Ivan's life who does not fear death, and also the only one who, apart from his own son, shows compassion for him. Ivan begins to question whether he has, in fact, lived a good life.\nIn the final days of his life, Ivan makes a clear split between an artificial life, such as his own, which masks the true meaning of life and makes one fear death, and an authentic life, the life of Gerasim. Authentic life is marked by compassion and sympathy, the artificial life by self-interest. Then \"some force\" strikes Ivan in the chest and side, and he is brought into the presence of a bright light. His hand falls onto his nearby son's head, and Ivan pities his son. He no longer hates his daughter or wife, but rather feels pity for them, and hopes his death will release them. In so doing, his terror of death leaves him, and as Tolstoy suggests, death itself disappears.\n\nInterpretation\nIn 1984, philosopher Merold Westphal said that the story depicts \"death as an enemy which:\n(1) leads us to deceive ourselves,\n(2) robs us of the meaning of life, and\n(3) puts us in solitary confinement.\"\nIn 1997, psychologist Mark Freeman wrote:\n\nTolstoy's book is about many things: the tyranny of bourgeois niceties, the terrible weak spots of the human heart, the primacy and elision of death. But more than anything, I would offer, it is about the consequences of living without meaning, that is, without a true and abiding connection to one's life ... (384)\nIndeed, the mundane portrayal of Ivan's life coupled with the dramatization of his long and grueling battle with death seems to directly reflect Tolstoy's theories about moral living, which he largely derived during his sabbatical from personal and professional duties in 1877. In his lectures on Russian literature, Russian-born novelist and critic Vladimir Nabokov argues that, for Tolstoy, a sinful life (such as Ivan's) is moral death. Therefore, death, the return of the soul to God, is, for Tolstoy, moral life. To quote Nabokov: \"The Tolstoyan formula is: Ivan lived a bad life and since the bad life is nothing but the death of the soul, then Ivan lived a living death; and since beyond death is God's living light, then Ivan died into a new life \u2013 Life with a capital L.\"\nDeath permeates the narrative in a realistic and absorbing fashion, but the actual physicality of death is only present in the early chapters during Ivan's wake. Instead, the story leads the reader through a pensive, metaphysical exploration of the reason for death and what it means to truly live. Tolstoy was a man who struggled greatly with self-doubt and spiritual reflection, especially as he grew close to his own death in 1910. In his book A Confession, Tolstoy writes:\n\nNo matter how often I may be told, \"You cannot understand the meaning of life so do not think about it, but live,\" I can no longer do it: I have already done it too long. I cannot now help seeing day and night going round and bringing me to death. That is all I see, for that alone is true. All else is false.\nThis personal epiphany caused significant spiritual upheaval in Tolstoy's life, prompting him to question the Russian Orthodox Church, sexuality, education, serfdom, etc. The literature Tolstoy composed during this period is some of his most controversial and philosophical, among which falls The Death of Ivan Ilyich and other famous short stories such as The Kreutzer Sonata and The Devil. From a biographical standpoint, therefore, it is possible to interpret The Death of Ivan Ilyich as a manifestation of Tolstoy's embroilment with death and the meaning of his own life during his final years. In other words, by dramatizing a particular sort of lifestyle and its unbearable decline, Tolstoy is able to impart his philosophy that success as it is judged by society, such as Ivan Ilyich's, comes at a great moral cost and if one decides to pay this cost, life will become hollow and insincere and therefore worse than death.\nMartin Heidegger's magnum opus, Being and Time (1927), refers to the novella as an illustration of Being towards death.\n\nEnglish translations\nAylmer and Louise Maude\nConstance Garnett (1902)\nRosemary Edmonds (1960)\nLynn Solotaroff (1981)\nIan Dreiblatt (2008)\nRichard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky (2009)\nPeter Carson (2013)\nNicolas Pasternak Slater (2015)\nKirsten Lodge (2016)\n\nAdaptations\nFilm \n\nIkiru (1952) directed by Akira Kurosawa\nA Simple Death (1985) directed by Alexander Kaidanovsky\nIvans Xtc (2000) directed by Bernard Rose\nThe Last Step (2005) directed by Ali Mosaffa\nLiving (2022) directed by Oliver Hermanus\nOpera\n\nDeath of Ivan Ilych: A Full-Length Chamber Opera in One Act (2021) Composed by John Young with libretto by Alan Olejniczak.

Unfortunately, shortly after the photo session, the father suffers a fatal heart attack. After his death, his eldest son Shin'ichir\u014d announces that as their father had acted as a guarantor for a company which has gone bankrupt, they must help pay off that company's debts. The family sells off all their late father's properties and antiques, leaving only an old house by the sea. Meanwhile, the mother and the youngest daughter Setsuko go and stay with Shin'ichir\u014d and his wife. The unmarried second brother Sh\u014djir\u014d takes the opportunity to move away from Japan to Tianjin, China (which had been occupied by Japan during the Second Sino-Japanese war).\nThe mother and Setsuko disharmonise with Shin'ichir\u014d's wife Kazuko and go to stay with Chizuko, the married eldest sister. However, Setsuko's plans to go out to work are met with vehement objections from Chizuko, who finds the idea disgraceful since they are an upper-class family. Chizuko also clashes with the mother over Chizuko's son, who has been playing truant from school. Instead of accepting Setsuko's second sister Ayako offer to live with her and her husband, Mrs. Toda and Setsuko decide to move out to the unsold dilapidated house by the sea. Ayako and her husband are secretly relieved for not having to take them in.\nOn the first anniversary of the father's death, the family comes together for a ceremonial gathering. Sh\u014djir\u014d arrives in time for the family dinner and is shocked to learn that his mother and Setsuko are staying alone by the sea. He reprimands his brother and his sisters for not doing their part as children and urges them to leave at once, which they do. After dinner, Sh\u014djir\u014d asks his mother and Setsuko to stay with him in Tianjin, to which they agree. Setsuko tries to arrange a marriage between Sh\u014djir\u014d and her friend Tokiko, who has come for a visit, but Sh\u014djir\u014d runs off to the beach before she can get them to meet.\n\nCast\nMieko Takamine - Setsuko Toda\nShin Saburi - Sh\u014djir\u014d Toda\nHideo Fujino - Shintar\u014d Toda\nFumiko Katsuragi - Mrs. Toda\nMitsuko Yoshikawa - Chizuru\nChish\u016b Ry\u016b - Friend\nMasao Hayama - Ryokichi\nTatsuo Sait\u014d - Shin'ichir\u014d\nKuniko Miyake - Kazuko\nMichiko Kuwano - Tokiko\n\nProduction and reception\nBrothers and Sisters of the Toda Family was Ozu's first film after a three year hiatus. Unsatisfied with his salary paid by the Shochiku film studio, Ozu approached the company's president Shir\u014d Kido, asking for a raise, which Kido conditioned on the outcome of his next film. During filming, Ozu was pressured into a tight shooting schedule by Shochiku.\nBrothers and Sisters of the Toda Family was awarded as \"Best Film of the Year\" by Kinema Junpo, and Ozu's first box office hit, which he ascribed to the popularity of its stars Shin Saburi and Mieko Takamine, who both worked with Ozu for the first time. As a result, Ozu received a long-term contract by the studio.\n\nHome media\nIn 2010, the BFI released a Region 2 DVD of the film as a bonus feature on its Dual Format Edition (Blu-ray + DVD) of Tokyo Story.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nBrothers and Sisters of the Toda Family at IMDb","194":"The Ceremony (\u5100\u5f0f, Gishiki) is a 1971 Japanese drama film directed by Nagisa \u014cshima, starring Kenzo Kawarasaki and Atsuko Kaku. The film takes place in post-war Japan, following a family clan through their wedding and funeral ceremonies, and the lengths the elder generation goes to preserve their traditions in spite of the damage it causes to the younger.\n\nPlot\nThe film begins with Masuo Sakurada receiving a telegram from his cousin Terumichi. He is traveling with his cousin Ritsuko to check out his cabin and see if the telegram is true. Masuo has a flashback to the ceremony on the first anniversary of his father's death, after he and his mother are repatriated to Japan from Huludao. Because his younger brother died before they returned from the former Manchukuo, Masuo is expected to live for two sons.\nThroughout each of the ceremonies, the tangled family web is revealed, with numerous instances of incest that make the relationships between each of the family members somewhat unclear. The continued incest is not only expected amongst the family. Masuo himself is interested in Setsuko, and later Ritsuko, and finds himself in competition with Terumichi for them.\nMasuo finds himself sacrificing much of his freedom for the family. He has a talent for baseball, but gives it up when his mother dies and he is not present. He burns all of his baseball possessions except his glove. His sacrifice reaches its climax when he goes through a marriage ceremony to an absentee bride at his grandfather's insistence. He finally releases his frustration and hatred for his grandfather afterward. His grandfather dies years later, and at his memorial service Masuo is asked by his uncles to marry as quickly as possible to have another heir to the family lineage.\nMasuo and Ritsuko finally arrive at Terumichi's cabin in the film's final segment, to discover that the telegram informing them of Terumichi's death is true. Ritsuko feels an obligation to commit suicide next to Terumichi, because he had been her lover. Masuo leaves the scene, and outside has a flashback to a childhood memory of playing baseball with his cousins and Setsuko, who have all died.\n\nCast\nNobuko Otowa as Sakurada Shizu\nKenz\u014d Kawarasaki as Masuo\nKei Sat\u014d as Kazuomi, Grandfather\nAtsuko Kaku as Ritsuko\nAtsuo Nakamura as Terumichi\nAkiko Koyama as Setsuko\nFumio Watanabe as Susumu\nKiyoshi Tsuchiya as Tadashi\nHosei Komatsu as Sakurada Isamu\nRokk\u014d Toura as Sakurada Mamoru\nEitar\u014d Ozawa as Tachibana Takeyo\n\nProduction\nThemes and interpretations\nThe Ceremony, like many other \u014cshima films, is often seen as a social critique of Japanese society. One of the most important themes in the film is that of the clan's attempt to look prosperous on the outside, while it is secretly falling apart from within. In his article on Nagisa \u014cshima at Senses of Cinema, Nelson Kim makes the case that this is showing how Japan in and of itself is \"trapped between past and present\", with an older generation stuck in their ways and a younger generation afraid to speak up. Any attempt at changing of the social order is quelled. This is seen best with the character of Tadashi, a far-right nationalist sympathizer who coincidentally dies after attempting to interrupt Masuo's wedding ceremony.\nThe film also shows the lengths that the Sakurada clan goes to preserve traditions, and how they negatively affect the younger generations. This is best seen in Masuo's wedding scene, in which his bride does not appear. Rather than canceling the wedding, Kazuomi insists that the ceremony go through as planned, with Masuo facing the embarrassment of having to marry a nonexistent bride.\nThe incest committed within the family is also a recurring critique of Japanese society. The clan's obsession with inbreeding to keep the family line pure is a reflection of the conformity, xenophobia, and racism that pervade Japanese society. Xenophobia is also satirized again at Masuo's wedding ceremony, when a relative of the absent bride is giving a speech on how this nonexistent girl is a \"perfect and pure Japanese girl\" who has been untainted by foreign influence.\nA recurring scene in the film involves Masuo putting his ear to the ground. The first time the scene is shown, he explains that he is listening for his brother, who was buried alive in northeast China. This is repeated the night before Setsuko's death, and again at the end of the film. This gesture becomes a metaphor for the backward morality and that has crippled the humanity of the Sakurada clan.\n\nStyle and form\nThe Ceremony has a nonlinear narrative, jumping back and forth between the present, with Masuo and Ritsuko heading out to find Terumichi, and the past, all the weddings and funerals Masuo attended through his life. Masuo often delivers voice-over narration directed to his relatives about his regrets of the past and his feelings of how they affected his life. The musical score appears mostly during the present day sequences between Masuo and Ritsuko, or in sequences which would otherwise be silent. The ceremonies in the past usually do not have any musical accompaniment.\n\u014cshima and cinematographer Toichiru Narushima often make use of symmetrical framing and wide-angle lenses, and throughout each ceremony often track the camera in toward individuals who are talking. In wider shots within the ceremonies, the camera often focuses on one side of the clan's seating arrangement at the ceremony, framed so that everyone in the frame is facing the same direction, similar to the family meal scene at the end of Yasujir\u014d Ozu's Tokyo Story.\nThe Ceremony makes use of many long takes. Some of the more private conversations during the ceremonies are played out throughout static long takes, with none of the characters moving around the screen. Wide-angle tracking shots are often used to help establish locations, as the film does not make usage of the 180 degree rule in its editing.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nThe Ceremony at AllMovie\nThe Ceremony at IMDb\nThe Ceremony at Rotten Tomatoes","195":"The Eel (\u3046\u306a\u304e, Unagi) is a 1997 film directed by Shohei Imamura and starring K\u014dji Yakusho, Misa Shimizu, Mitsuko Baisho, and Akira Emoto. The film is loosely based on the novel On Parole by celebrated author Akira Yoshimura, combined with elements from the director's 1966 film The Pornographers. It shared the Palme d'Or at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival with Taste of Cherry. It also won the 1998 Kinema Junpo Award for Best Film of the Year.\n\nPlot\nIn Chiba Prefecture, Japan, acting on the advice of an anonymous note, Takuro Yamashita (K\u014dji Yakusho) returns home early one night to find his wife in bed with another man. He kills her and then turns himself in to the police. After being released from prison, he opens a barber shop and brings along a pet eel that he talks to while mostly ignoring conversation with others. He helps save Keiko Hattori (Misa Shimizu) from a suicide attempt, resulting in her working at the shop. She starts developing romantic feelings for him, but he acts nonchalant and refuses the boxed lunches she prepares for him when he goes eel-hunting with the fisherman Jukichi Takada. Takuro recognizes the local garbageman from prison and the garbageman starts to stalk Takuro and Keiko, believing that Takuro isn't repentant enough for his crimes. He attempts to rape Keiko and leaves a letter revealing Takuro's past on the door of his barber shop, but it is removed by Takada. Keiko finds out that she is pregnant with the baby of Eiji Dojima (Tomorowo Taguchi), a loan shark, and that it is too late for an abortion. One night, the garbageman goes to Takuro's shop and lectures him, accusing him of killing his wife out of jealousy. The two get into an altercation and Takuro fends him off. Keiko goes back to her old company, where she is the vice-president, and retrieves her mother's bankbook. This results in Dojima angrily going to the barber shop, along with henchman, and accusing her of theft since he was planning to reinvest the funds into his business. Dojima's group and Keiko's fight, with the false revelation that Keiko is pregnant with Takuro's child. The police find that Keiko's mother never signed power of attorney papers for Dojima, but a parole violation meeting for Takuro causes him to be sent back to prison for a year. Takuro lets his eel go and accepts a boxed lunch from Keiko, who promises to wait for him with her baby.\n\nCast\nK\u014dji Yakusho \u2013 Takuro Yamashita\nMisa Shimizu \u2013 Keiko Hattori\nMitsuko Baisho \u2013 Misako Nakajima\nAkira Emoto \u2013 Tamotsu Takasaki\nFujio Tsuneta \u2013 Jiro Nakajima\nShow Aikawa \u2013 Yuji Nozawa\nKen Kobayashi \u2013 Masaki Saito\nSabu Kawahara \u2013 Seitaro Misato\nEtsuko Ichihara \u2013 Fumie Hattori\nTomorowo Taguchi \u2013 Eiji Dojima\nChiho Terada \u2013 Emiko Yamashita\n\nReception\nLawrence Van Gelder of The New York Times said that the film \"swims with grace, insight and vast compassion\", complimenting the \"vivid\" cast that allowed the director \"not only to bare the passions that seethe beneath the orderly surface and apparent conformity of Japanese life but also to ponder emotions and issues that know no nationality.\" David Stratton of Variety described the film as \"filled with colorful characters, and fluctuating alarmingly\u2014but with surprising success\u2014among several levels on the emotional spectrum\", saying that the director \"has created a rich tapestry of characters and situations, all of it vividly brought to life with pristine visuals and a generous emotional warmth.\" Describing its cinematography, Noah Cowan of Filmmaker said that the film \"is shot in sunny, saturated colors, lending it the air of a filmmaker content with his achievements in the sunset of his career.\"\nFilm critic Tadao Sato stated that in light of a lack of attention regarding Japanese films in Japan itself at the time, the Japanese public had a lack of awareness about the film, and in regards to positive foreign reception of The Eel, \"It was gratifying, then, that 'Unagi' should receive international recognition at a time when Japanese themselves were ignoring such films.\"\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nThe Eel at IMDb\nThe Eel at the Japanese Movie Database (in Japanese)","196":"The Family Game (\u5bb6\u65cf\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0, Kazoku G\u0113mu) is a 1983 Japanese movie directed by Yoshimitsu Morita. The Family Game received several awards including the best movie of the year as selected by Japanese critics. Although the movie missed the Japan Academy Prize for the Best Picture (losing out to Palme d'Or Winner The Ballad of Narayama), Ichir\u014dta Miyagawa was awarded Newcomer of the Year.\n\nPlot summary\nThe Numata family consists of the father, K\u014dsuke (Juzo Itami); mother, Chikako (Saori Yuki); and two sons, Shinichi (Jun'ichi Tsujita) and Shigeyuki (Ichir\u014dta Miyagawa). Shigeyuki is a junior high school student. He will soon be taking a high school entrance examination. Unlike his high school student brother, Shinichi, who lives up to the father's expectations, Shigeyuki\u2019s grades are poor, and he is only interested in roller coasters. His father finds a private tutor, Yoshimoto (Y\u016bsaku Matsuda), for Shigeyuki and imposes all responsibilities for his exam on the tutor. Yoshimoto's behaviour is extremely strange, including kissing Shigeyuki and hitting him painfully hard. Even though Yoshimoto is a seventh year student of a third-rate university, Shigeyuki\u2019s marks become better and better. Eventually he passes the exam for the high school. At a family celebration, Yoshimoto begins to riot, hitting people, pouring wine on their heads, and throwing spaghetti around wildly.\n\nCast\nY\u016bsaku Matsuda as Katsu Yoshimoto\nJuzo Itami as K\u014dsuke Numata\nSaori Yuki as Chikako Numata\nIchir\u014dta Miyagawa as Shigeyuki Numata\nJunichi Tsujita as Shinichi Numata, the older brother\nYoko Aki as Yoshimoto's girlfriend\nJun Togawa as Neighbors wife\n\nTV Series\nThe Family Game was adapted into a TV series in 2013 by Fuji TV, starring Sho Sakurai as the tutor K\u014dya Yoshimoto.\n\nThemes\nThe film focuses on a dysfunctional middle-class nuclear family\u2014each family member is connected not internally, but through the social roles they are expected to take on, and the pressure of these social expectations further accelerates the breakdown in their communication.\nJapanese critics saw the film as showing the change to a new epoch and a post-modern sensibility. One said that if Japanese before and during the high growth economy defined their reality first though \"ideals\" and then through \"dreams,\" and tried to change reality according to those visions, then in the post-high growth era, from the mid-1970s on, they no longer tried to change reality but to remain content with reality as \"fiction.\" The Numatas' table is not unrealistic, but fixes the \"un-naturalness\"  of reality itself in an age when families watch television while eating. This epochal shift was marked, another critic said, by Morita's films and the works of novelist Haruki Murakami and musician Sakamoto Ryuichi, leading to a culture which celebrates meaninglessness.\n\nNotes\nBibliography\nGerow, Aaron (2008). \"Playing with Postmodernism: Morita Yoshimitsu's Family Game\".

It is based on the 1869 novel The Idiot by Fyodor Dostoevsky. The original 265-minute version of the film, faithful to the novel, has been long lost. A nearly three-hour release, reflecting a 100-minute studio-imposed cut, currently survives as the most complete version of the film available for contemporary audiences.\nThe film stars Setsuko Hara who plays the part of Taeko Nasu, the beautiful mistress of Tohata. The characters are involved in a weblike plot of intersecting relationships.\n\nPlot\nPart One: Love and Agony\nThe action starts on a ship traveling from Okinawa.  Kameda, who suffers from \"epileptic dementia\" (which he refers to as \"idiocy\"), is heading to Hokkaido.\nThe movie explains that \"Dostoyevsky wanted to portray a genuinely good man. It may seem ironic, choosing a young idiot as his hero, but in this world, goodness and idiocy are often equated. The story tells of the destruction of a pure soul by a faithless world.\"\nKameda has been confined to a mental asylum since he suffered a mental breakdown after he was mistaken for a war criminal and almost executed by a firing squad following World War II. During his journey, he meets and becomes friends with Denkichi Akama, who \"hadn't laughed for years. He was the son of an old Sapporo family, and his father's harsh discipline had made him feel like a caged animal. Oddly, he came to like Kameda, who made him laugh heartily. Akama told him (Kameda) about Taeko Nasu, whom he'd met six months earlier. One look at her had been enough to release his pent-up passions.\"  Akama is returning home to Hokkaido for the first time since he stole money from his father to buy a diamond ring for Taeko. Taeko was the beautiful mistress of a rich man named Tohata since she was a child, but she ran away six months earlier, at the same time as when Akama had bought her the ring. Akama's father has since died, and he is on his way to claim a large inheritance. Akama and Kameda are both on the same train to Sapporo. Kameda is on his way to see Mr. Ono, \"his only relative in the world\".\nMr. Ono's wife asks her husband what he is going to do about Kameda. He tells her that he will try to find Kameda work and that Kameda can rent a room from Kayama, a man who is to marry Taeko in exchange for Y600,000. Kameda's father had left Kameda a large ranch, which Ono had sold through Kayama.\nKameda is unaware of his inheritance, which Ono's daughter, Ayako, later teases him about.\nTohata, in an attempt to sever his ties with Taeko and avoid public disgrace for his long-term abusive treatment of her, which has twisted her psyche and made her a social pariah, offers a dowry of Y600,000 to Kayama if he will marry Taeko, a deal which was brokered by Mr. Ono. Kayama secretly loves Ono's daughter Ayako.  When Akama finds out about the dowry offer, he offers Kayama Y1,000,000 not to marry her in a threatening confrontation. Kameda and Taeko meet, and he is immediately drawn to and wants to help her with the sadness he sees in her, while she is drawn to the kindness she sees in him, which gives her the strength to run away from all of these men treating her like chattel. Kameda and Akama both follow Taeko, while Kayama, who is really attracted to Ono's daughter Ayako, does not.\nKameda tells Akama he should not marry Taeko as it would mean the ruin for both Taeko and Akama. Akama tells Kameda she really loves Kameda and Akama gives her to him.\n\nPart Two: Love and Loathing\nTaeko seems to love Kameda, but she thinks it would ruin his life to marry someone with her reputation, so she considers marrying Akama and writes to Ayako encouraging her to marry Kameda, since he is known to have written her a complimentary letter. Kameda proposes to Ayako.  Ayako vacillates violently between expressing love and hate for Kameda and cannot understand what Taeko's true motives are, since they have never met. Ayako arranges for them to talk at Akama's house, and Taeko realizes that she has been putting Ayako on a pedestal and is no less worthy of Kameda's love than Ayako is. Ayako leaves, Kameda follows her to make sure she gets home safely, and Taeko faints, thinking Kameda has chosen Ayako over her.\nWhen Kameda returns to Akama's house, he discovers that Akama, who is insanely jealous of the feelings he knows Taeko has for Kameda and not for him, but has been unable to make himself dislike Kameda when they see each other in person, has killed Taeko. He does not want her corpse to start to smell, so the two men do not light a fire and spend the night huddled around candles and bundled under blankets before they both, seemingly, die the next morning. Upon hearing this news, Ayako remarks that she is the idiot for not having been able to love without hatred, like Kameda did.\n\nCast\nProduction background\nThe film is in black and white at an aspect ratio of 1.37:1. This was Kurosawa's second film for the Shochiku studio, after Scandal (1950).\nIt was originally intended to be a two-part film with a running time of 265 minutes. After a single, poorly received, screening of the full-length version, the film was severely cut at the request of the studio. This was against Kurosawa's wishes. When the re-edited version was also deemed too long by the studio, Kurosawa sardonically suggested the film be cut lengthwise instead. According to Japanese film scholar Donald Richie, there are no existing prints of the original 265-minute version. Kurosawa would return to Shochiku later to make Rhapsody in August (1991), and, according to Alex Cox, is said to have searched the Shochiku archives for the original cut of the film to no avail.\nThe Idiot was the first feature film to depict the Sapporo Snow Festival, an annual event in Sapporo, Hokkaido that began in 1950. In the movie, Kameda and Ayako visit the festival and see its large snow sculptures.\n\n\"Of all my films, people wrote to me most about this one... ...I had wanted to make The Idiot long before Rashomon. Since I was little I've liked Russian literature, but I find that I like Dostoevsky the best and had long thought that this book would make a wonderful film. He is still my favourite author, and he is the one \u2014 I still think \u2014 who writes most honestly about human existence.\"\n\nReception\nRotten Tomatoes reports 70% approval for The Idiot among ten critics, with an average rating of 6.9\/10.\n\nSee also\nList of incomplete or partially lost films\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nThe Idiot at IMDb\nThe Idiot at the Japanese Movie Database (in Japanese)\nThe Idiot at the TCM Movie Database\nThe Idiot at AllMovie","202":"The Incident (\u4e8b\u4ef6, Jiken) is a 1978 Japanese film directed by Yoshitaro Nomura.

It tells the story of two peasants who agree to escort a man and a woman across enemy lines in return for gold without knowing that he is a general and the woman is a princess. The film stars Toshiro Mifune as General Makabe Rokur\u014dta and Misa Uehara as Princess Yuki while the peasants, Tahei and Matashichi, are portrayed by Minoru Chiaki and Kamatari Fujiwara respectively.\nThe Hidden Fortress was the fourth highest-grossing film of the year in Japan, and Kurosawa's most successful film up to that point. It was a significant influence on the 1977 American film Star Wars.\n\nPlot\nTwo bedraggled peasants, Tahei and Matashichi, sell their homes and leave to enlist with the feudal Yamana clan, hoping to make their fortunes as soldiers. Instead, they are mistaken for soldiers of the defeated Akizuki clan, have their weapons confiscated, and are forced to help dig graves before being sent away without any food. After quarrelling and splitting up, the two are each captured again and reunited when the Yamana force them alongside dozens of other prisoners to dig through the ruins of the Akizuki castle for the clan's secret reserve of gold. After a prisoner uprising, Tahei and Matashichi slip away, steal some rice, and make camp near a river.\nWhile building a fire, they find a piece of gold marked with the crescent of the Akizuki clan hidden in a hollowed-out stick. Looking for more of the gold, the peasants are discovered by a mysterious man whom they take to be a bandit. They explain how they intend to escape Yamana territory: rather than cross the closely-guarded border into the neighboring state of Hayakawa, they will travel to Yamana itself and then pass into Hayakawa. The stranger is enthused by their plan, so he shows them another piece of gold, and he leads them to a secret camp in the mountains where the rest is hidden. Unbeknownst to them, the man is a famous Akizuki general, Makabe Rokur\u014dta. Although Rokur\u014dta initially planned to kill the peasants, he changes his mind and decides to use their plan to bring the gold and Princess Yuki of the Akizuki clan, also hidden in the camp, to Hayakawa, whose lord has promised to protect them.\nRokur\u014dta escorts Princess Yuki and the huge cache, 200 kan of the clan's gold (still hidden in hollowed-out logs of wood), to Yamana, bringing Matashichi and Tahei to help carry the gold but kept unaware of Yuki and Rokur\u014dta's identities. To protect Yuki, he has her pretend to be a deaf-mute and has a decoy (Rokur\u014dta's younger sister) sent to the Yamana to be executed so they will believe that she is dead. During their travels, Tahei and Matashichi get the group into dangerous situations several times owing to their cowardice and greed. During a stop for the night at an inn, Yuki forces Rokur\u014dta to buy the freedom of a captive young woman who had belonged to the Akizuki clan, who then refuses to leave them.\nAfter losing their horses and obtaining a cart to move the gold, the group is spotted by a Yamana patrol, and Rokur\u014dta is forced to kill them. While pursuing two stragglers, he accidentally rides into a Yamana camp, where the commanding officer, Rokur\u014dta's old rival Hyoe Tadokoro, recognizes him. Tadokoro is sorry he didn't get to face Rokur\u014dta in battle and challenges him to a lance duel. Rokur\u014dta wins, but spares Tadokoro's life before stealing a horse and riding back to the group. While in Yamana, they see worshippers gathering for the Fire Festival, so Tahei and Matashichi decide to hide the load of wood among them, but, since they are under the eyes of the Yamana soldiers, they are forced to throw the cart onto the bonfire and join in the ritual dance. Princess Yuki is quite taken by the philosophy behind the Festival regarding the shortness of life and the pettiness of the world. The next day they dig the gold out of the fire's remains and take away as much as they can carry. One night as they approach the Hayakawa border, they are surrounded. Matashichi and Tahei manage to hide in the confusion while the rest are captured by Yamana soldiers and detained at an outpost. The two of them try to turn in Rokur\u014dta for a reward, but having already captured them, the soldiers laugh at them and they leave for Hayakawa with nothing.\nTadokoro comes to identify the prisoners the night before their execution. Tadokoro's face is now disfigured by a large scar which he explains is the result of a beating ordered by the Yamana lord, as punishment for letting Rokur\u014dta escape. Yuki proclaims that she has no fear of death and thanks Rokur\u014dta for letting her see humanity's ugliness and beauty from a new perspective, and she repeats the ritual chant from the Fire Festival. The next day, as the soldiers start marching the prisoners to be executed, Tadokoro begins singing the same chant, and suddenly sends the horses carrying the gold running across the border. He frees the prisoners and distracts the guards so they can ride off, but Yuki tells him to join them. The entire group manages to escape across the border into Hayakawa.\nMatashichi and Tahei, both hungry and tired, stumble across the lost gold carried by the horses and immediately start arguing about dividing it between them, before being arrested by Hayakawa soldiers as thieves. The peasants are brought before an armoured samurai and a well-dressed noblewoman. General Rokur\u014dta and Princess Yuki finally reveal their identities to the astonished peasants. Thanking them for saving the gold (which will be used to restore her clan), the princess rewards Matashichi and Tahei with a single ry\u014d on the condition that they share it. As the two men leave the castle to walk back to their village, they begin to laugh upon realizing that they have finally made their fortunes.\n\nCast\nToshiro Mifune as General Rokurota Makabe (\u771f\u58c1 \u516d\u90ce\u592a, Makabe Rokurota)\nMinoru Chiaki as Tahei\nKamatari Fujiwara as Matashichi\nSusumu Fujita as General Hyoe Tadokoro (\u7530\u6240 \u5175\u885b, Tadokoro Hyoe)\nTakashi Shimura as General Izumi Nagakura (\u9577\u5009 \u548c\u6cc9, Nagakura Izumi)\nMisa Uehara as Princess Yuki\nEiko Miyoshi as Yuki's lady-in-waiting\nToshiko Higuchi as a prostitute purchased by the group who chooses to accompany them\nY\u016b Fujiki as a Yamana soldier\nSachio Sakai as a samurai\nYoshio Tsuchiya as a Yamana samurai\nKokuten K\u014dd\u014d as an old villager who tells Matashichi about a reward for Yuki's capture\nK\u014dji Mitsui as a Yamana guard overseeing the excavation of Akizuki Castle\n\nProduction\nThe Hidden Fortress was Kurosawa's first feature filmed in a widescreen format, Tohoscope, which he continued to use for the next decade.

Fuji, where bad weather from the record-breaking Kanagawa typhoon delayed the production. Toho's frustration with Kurosawa's slow pace of shooting led to the director forming his own production company the following year, though he continued to distribute through Toho.\n\nMusic\nThe film's musical score was composed by Masaru Sato.

The film was the highest-grossing film for Toho in 1958, ranking as the fourth highest-grossing film overall in Japan that year. In box-office terms, The Hidden Fortress was Kurosawa's most successful film, until the 1961 release of  Yojimbo.\nThe film was released theatrically in the United States by Toho International Col. with English subtitles. It was screened in San Francisco in November 1959 and received a wider release on October 6, 1960, with a 126-minute running time. The film was re-issued in the United States in 1962 with a 90-minute running time. The film was compared unfavorably to Rashomon (1950) and Seven Samurai (1954), and performed poorly at the U.S. box office.\n\nCritical reception\nIn a 1957 review, Variety called it \"a long, interesting, humour-laden picture in medieval Japan\". Performances of the lead actors, Kurosawa's direction and Ichio Yamazaki's camerawork were praised.\nAn article published in The New York Times on January 24, 1962, featured a review of the film by journalist Bosley Crowther, who called The Hidden Fortress a superficial film. He said that Kurosawa, \"the Japanese director whose cinema skills have been impressed upon us in many pictures, beginning with \"Rashomon\", is obviously not above pulling a little wool over his audiences' eyes \u2014 a little stooping to Hollywoodisms \u2014 in order to make a lively film.\" Crowther further opined that \"Kurosawa, for all his talent, is as prone to pot boiling as anyone else.\"\nWriting for The Criterion Collection in 1987, David Ehrenstein called it \"one of the greatest action-adventure films ever made\" and a \"fast-paced, witty and visually stunning\" samurai film. According to Ehrenstein:\n\nThe battle on the steps in Chapter 2 (anticipating the climax of Ran) is as visually overwhelming as any of the similar scenes in Griffith's Intolerance. The use of composition in depth in the fortress scene in Chapter 4 is likewise as arresting as the best of Eisenstein or David Lean. Toshiro Mifune's muscular demonstrations of heroic derring-do in the horse-charge scene (Chapter 11) and the scrupulously choreographed spear duel that follows it (Chapter 12) is in the finest tradition of Douglas Fairbanks. Overall, there\u2019s a sense of sheer \"movieness\" to The Hidden Fortress that places it plainly in the ranks of such grand adventure entertainments as Gunga Din, The Thief of Baghdad, and Fritz Lang's celebrated diptych The Tiger of Eschnapur and The Hindu Tomb.\nDavid Parkinson of the Empire on a review posted on January 1, 2000, gave the film four out of five stars and wrote \"Somewhat overshadowed by the likes of Seven Samurai, this is a vigorously placed, meticulously staged adventure. It's not top drawer, but still ranks among the best of Kurosawa's minor masterpieces.\"\nWriting for The Criterion Collection in 2001, Armond White said \"The Hidden Fortress holds a place in cinema history comparable to John Ford's Stagecoach: It lays out the plot and characters of an on-the-road epic of self-discovery and heroic action. In a now-familiar fashion, Rokur\u014dta and Princess Yuki fight their way to allied territory, accompanied by a scheming, greedy comic duo who get surprised by their own good fortune. Kurosawa always balances valor and greed, seriousness and humor, while depicting the misfortunes of war.\"\nUpon the film's UK re-release in 2002, Jamie Russell, reviewing the film for the BBC, said it \"effortlessly intertwines action, drama, and comedy\", calling it \"both cracking entertainment and a wonderful piece of cinema.\"\n\nPeter Bradshaw of The Guardian made a review on February 1, 2002. According to him:Revered now as an inspiration for George Lucas, Kurosawa's amiable, forthright epic romance happens on a scorched, rugged landscape which looks quite a lot like an alien planet. At other times, the movie plays like nothing so much as a roistering comedy western. But it has a cleverly contrived relationship between the principals, including a fantastically brash and virile Toshiro Mifune. The comedy co-exists with a dark view of life's brevity, and Kurosawa devises exhilarating setpieces and captivating images. Arthouse classics aren't usually as welcoming and entertaining as this.\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 96% based on 51 critic reviews, with the consensus, \"A feudal adventure told from an eccentric perspective, The Hidden Fortress is among Akira Kurosawa's most purely enjoyable epics.\"\n\nAwards\nThe film won the Silver Bear for Best Director at the 9th Berlin International Film Festival in 1959. Kinema Junpo awarded Shinobu Hashimoto the award for Best Screenwriter for his work on the film and for Tadashi Imai's Night Drum and Yoshitaro Nomura's Harikomi.\n\nLegacy\nInfluence\nAmerican director George Lucas has acknowledged the heavy influence of The Hidden Fortress on his 1977 film Star Wars, particularly in the technique of telling the story from the perspective of the film's lowliest characters, C-3PO  and R2-D2.  Some of the major characters from Star Wars have clear analogues in The Hidden Fortress, including C-3PO and R2-D2 being based on Tahei and Matashichi, and Princess Leia on Princess Yuki. Lucas's original plot outline for Star Wars bore an even greater resemblance to the plot of The Hidden Fortress; this draft would subsequently be reused as the basis for The Phantom Menace. The movie is referenced in Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, where during a cutscene for the first level of Return of the Jedi, there is a flag written in Aurebesh, which translates to \"Hidden Fortress\".\nA number of plot elements from The Hidden Fortress are used in the 2006 video game Final Fantasy XII.\n\nRemake\nA loose remake entitled Hidden Fortress: The Last Princess was directed by Shinji Higuchi and released on May 10, 2008.\n\nReferences\nSources\nFurther reading\nExternal links\n\nThe Hidden Fortress at IMDb\nThe Hidden Fortress at AllMovie\nThe Hidden Fortress at Rotten Tomatoes\nThe Hidden Fortress (in Japanese) at the Japanese Movie Database\nThe Hidden Fortress: Three Good Men and a Princess an essay by Catherine Russell at the Criterion Collection","204":"The Insect Woman (\u306b\u3063\u307d\u3093\u6606\u866b\u8a18, Nippon konch\u016bki, lit. \"Entomological Chronicles of Japan\") is a 1963 Japanese drama film directed by Sh\u014dhei Imamura.

It was re-released with Getsuy\u014dbi no Yuka in February 1964, earning a similar amount.\nThe film was released as a region 1 NTSC DVD in 2009 as part of The Criterion Collection's Shohei Imamura DVD box and as a region B Blu-ray in 2011 by Masters of Cinema.\n\nReception\nVariety magazine declared the film being \"potent adult film fare by any nation's standards\" and praised the camera work by Masahisa Himeda and performances by Sachiko Hidari, Kazuo Kitamura and Jitsuko Yoshimura.

It is published by The Japan Times, Ltd. (\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u30b8\u30e3\u30d1\u30f3\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u30ba, Kabushiki gaisha Japan Taimuzu), a subsidiary of News2u Holdings, Inc. It is headquartered in the Kioicho Building (\u7d00\u5c3e\u4e95\u753a\u30d3\u30eb, Kioicho Biru) in Kioicho, Chiyoda, Tokyo.\n\nHistory\nThe Japan Times was launched by Motosada Zumoto on 22 March 1897, with the goal of giving Japanese people an opportunity to read and discuss news and current events in English to help Japan participate in the international community.\nIn 1906, Zumoto was asked by Japanese Resident-General of Korea It\u014d Hirobumi to lead the English-language newspaper The Seoul Press. Zumoto closely tied the operations of the two newspapers, with subscriptions of The Seoul Press being sold in Japan by The Japan Times, and vice versa for Korea. Both papers wrote critically of Korean culture and civilization, and advocated for Japan's colonial control over the peninsula in order to civilize the Koreans.\nThe newspaper was independent of government control, but from 1931 onward, the paper's editors experienced mounting pressure from the Japanese government to submit to its policies. In 1933, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs appointed Hitoshi Ashida, former ministry official, as chief editor.\nDuring World War II, the newspaper served as an outlet for Imperial Japanese government communication and editorial opinion. It was successively renamed The Japan Times and Mail (1918\u20131940) following its merger with The Japan Mail, The Japan Times and Advertiser (1940\u20131943) following its merger with The Japan Advertiser, and Nippon Times (1943\u20131956), before reverting to the Japan Times title in 1956. The temporary change to Nippon Times occurred during the ban on English language sentiment during World War II-era Japan.\nShintaro Fukushima (1907\u20131987) became president of The Japan Times in 1956. He sold some of the company's shares to Toshiaki Ogasawara  (\u5c0f\u7b20\u539f \u654f\u6676 Ogasawara Toshiaki), who was chairman of Nifco, a manufacturer of automotive fasteners. Fukushima renounced management rights in 1983, after which Nifco acquired control of The Japan Times and brought about staff changes and alterations to the company's traditions established in 1897. Ogasawara served as the chairman and publisher of The Japan Times until 2016, when his daughter Yukiko Ogasawara (\u5c0f\u7b20\u539f \u6709\u8f1d\u5b50 Ogasawara Yukiko) succeeded him as chairman of the company. She had previously served as the company's president from 2006 to 2012, when she was replaced by career Japan Times staffer Takeharu Tsutsumi. Nifco sold The Japan Times to PR firm News2u Holdings, Inc. on 30 June 2017.\n\nContent\nThe Japan Times publishes The Japan Times, The Japan Times On Sunday, The Japan Times Alpha (a bilingual weekly), books in English and Japanese. Staff at The Japan Times are represented by two unions, one of which is Tozen.\n\nPrint\nThe Japan Times, Ltd. publishes three periodicals: The Japan Times, an English-language daily broadsheet; The Japan Times Weekly, an English-language weekly in tabloid form; and Shukan ST, also a weekly in tabloid form, targeted at Japanese readers learning the English language. Since 16 October 2013, The Japan Times has been printed and sold along with The New York Times International Edition.\n\nWeb\nPrinted stories from The Japan Times are archived online. The newspaper has a readers' forum and, since 2013, the website offers a section for readers' comments below articles. This came about during a redesign and redevelopment of the newspaper, using Responsive Web Design techniques so the site is optimised for all digital devices. The Japan Times has a social media presence on Twitter, and Facebook since 2007.\n\nControversy\nAfter being acquired by News2u, The Japan Times changed its editorial stance and contributor lineup as part of efforts to reduce criticism of the newspaper as an \"anti-Japanese\" outlet. In November 2018, it was announced in an editor's note that subsequent articles would use the term \"wartime laborers\" rather than \"forced labor\", and \"comfort women\" would be referred to as \"women who worked in wartime brothels, including those who did so against their will, to provide sex to Japanese soldiers\", instead of the previously used \"women who were forced to provide sex for Japanese troops before and during World War II.\" The change drew immediate criticism from readers and employees, with particular concerns expressed over the paper's apparent alignment with the political positions of Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe. In response to these criticisms, The Japan Times wrote in an article on 7 December 2018, \"We must admit that the editorial note undermined the relationships of trust we have built with our readers, reporters and staff. I would like to apologize for the inconvenience\", and denied criticism that it was in line with the intentions of the administration.\n\nContributors\nMark Brazil, Wild Watch nature columnist (1982\u20132015)\nMonty DiPietro, art critic\nJohn Gauntner, Nihonshu columnist\nJohn Gunning, sumo columnist\nDon Maloney\nFume Miyatake, Women in Business columnist\nJean Pearce, community columnist\nEzra Pound, Italian correspondent\nDreux Richard, African community, investigative\nDonald Richie, book, film critic\nElyse Rogers, Women in Business columnist\nMark Schilling, film critic\nRobbie Swinnerton, Tokyo Food File columnist\nEdward Seidensticker\nFred Varcoe, sports editor\nRobert Yellin, Ceramic Scene columnist\n\nSee also\nAsahi Shimbun\nInternational Herald Tribune\nYomiuri Shimbun\nGenki: An Integrated Course in Elementary Japanese \u2013 Japanese language learning textbooks published by the newspaper\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nDe Lange, William (2023).

The setting was changed for the film from late 19th-century Russia to Edo period Japan.\n\nPlot\nIn a run-down Edo tenement, an elderly man and his bitter wife rent out rooms and beds to the poor. The tenants are gamblers, prostitutes, petty thieves and drunk layabouts, all struggling to survive. The landlady\u2019s younger sister who helps the landlords with maintenance, brings in an old man and rents him a bed. Kahei, who dresses as a Buddhist pilgrim, quickly assumes the role of a mediator and grandfatherly figure, though there is an air of mystery about him, and some of the tenants suspect his past is not unblemished.\nSutekichi, thief and self-appointed tenement leader, is having an affair with Osugi the landlady, though he is gradually shifting his attention to her sweet-tempered sister. Okayo thinks little of him, however, which frustrates Sutekichi and sours his relationship with Osugi. Jealous and vengeful, Osugi seeks to persuade Sutekichi to murder her husband so she can turn him over to the authorities. Sutekichi sees through her plot and refuses to take any part in the murder. The husband discovers the affair, gets into a fight with Sutekichi, and is saved only through Kahei\u2019s intervention.\nSlowly, Okayo begins to see the good in Sutekichi and warms to his advances. Rokubei and Osugi beat Okayo, prompting the tenants to break into their house to save her. Sutekichi is enraged to learn how Okayo was treated and, in the ensuing chaos, accidentally kills Rokubei, and is then blamed by Osugi for her husband's death. Rather than defend himself, the enraged Sutekichi claims that she had goaded him into doing it. Okayo now believes that they have used her to provide an excuse for the killing. She will now have nothing to do with Sutekichi. Kahei, whose testimony could potentially have cleared him, runs away to avoid having to testify, adding substance to the suspicions that he had something to hide. Sutekichi and Osugi are arrested.\nOther subplots, some of a comic nature, involve the occupants of the tenement: a nihilistic gambler who rejects the pilgrim's hopeful entreaties to the other denizens; an aging actor who has lost his ability to memorize lines; a craftsman who appears indifferent to the impending death of his ailing wife, yet becomes a broken man when she finally dies; a destitute who claims to be descended from a samurai family, only to have this claim refuted; and a group of partying drunks who seem to rejoice in the face of misfortune.\n\nCast\nProduction\nKurosawa assembled his cast from among the top performers in Japanese cinema, dress-rehearsing them on-set for 60 days and shooting extended takes with multiple cameras to create a theatrical effect. Although the set was purposefully filthy, Kurosawa walked on it only in his indoor shoes, to the surprise of cast and crew; he explained that dirty though it was, it was still \"home\" to his characters.\n\nThemes\nThe film explores the Nietzschean theme that Buddhism (and religiousness in general) verges on nihilism by presenting two archetypal characters, the pilgrim and the gambler, who share a contentment that contrasts with the self-conscious existentialism of the other characters. The pilgrim\u2019s grace derives from believing that nothing on Earth matters because rewards are found in the afterlife; the gambler also believes nothing matters, but rather because he rejects religion and morality, seeking pleasure from life rather than purpose. Because both belief systems reject earthly matters and result in contentment, philosophers sometimes link Buddhism with nihilism; in Kurosawa\u2019s plot arc, the nihilistic gambler succeeds in outlasting the pilgrim, whose promises are unfulfilled and result in a character\u2019s suicide, which the gambler mocks. This fatalistic tone contrasts with Kurosawa\u2019s more humanistic approach in other films, and is regarded as a reason for the film's mixed response upon its release in Japan. In addition, such overt representation of downtrodden, hopeless characters (albeit from a different era) was rare in early post-occupation Japan's popular media, which attempted to downplay allusions to an underclass struggling with societal changes wrought by the war and its aftermath.\n\nRelease\nThe Lower Depths received a roadshow theatrical release on September 17, 1957 by Toho. It received general release in Japan on 1 October 1957.\nThe film was released by Brandon Films with English subtitles in the United States on 9 February 1962.\n\nAwards\nIsuzu Yamada won Kinema Junpo's award for Best Actress of the Year (for this film, Downtown, and Throne of Blood).\nToshiro Mifune won the Mainichi Film Concours Best Actor award (also for Downtown).\nK\u014dji Mitsui won both the Blue Ribbon Award and Mainichi Film Concours awards for Best Supporting Actor (also for The Unbalanced Wheel).\n\nReception\nIn 2009 the film was voted at No. 36 on the list of The Greatest Japanese Films of All Time by Japanese film magazine Kinema Junpo.\nThe Lower Depths has an 83% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on six critics' opinions.\n\nSee also\nThe Lower Depths, Jean Renoir's 1936 French film, also based on the play.\nSouls on the Road, a 1921 Japanese film directed by Minoru Murata based on the same play.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nThe Lower Depths at the Japanese Movie Database (in Japanese)\nThe Lower Depths at IMDb\nThe Lower Depths at AllMovie\nAkira Kurosawa\u2019s The Lower Depths an essay by Keiko McDonald & Thomas Rimer at the Criterion Collection","208":"The Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail (Japanese: \u864e\u306e\u5c3e\u3092\u8e0f\u3080\u7537\u9054, Hepburn: Tora no O o Fumu Otokotachi) is a 1945 Japanese period drama film written and directed by Akira Kurosawa, based on the kabuki play Kanjinch\u014d, which is in turn based on the Noh play Ataka. It depicts a famous 12th century incident in which Yoshitsune and a small group of samurai cross into enemy territory disguised as monks.\nThe film was initially banned by the occupying Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers (SCAP), likely due to its portrayal of feudal values. Kurosawa blamed bureaucratic sabotage by the wartime Japanese censors, who also disapproved. It was later released in 1952 following the signing of the Treaty of San Francisco.\n\nPlot\nIn 1185, the Heike clan fights against the Minamoto clan. After a bloody naval battle in the Seto Inland Sea, Yoshitsune Minamoto defeats the enemy and the survivors commit suicide. When the triumphant Yoshitsune arrives in Kyoto, his brother, the Shogun Yoritomo, is uneasy and orders his men to arrest Yoshitsune. However, Yoshitsune escapes with six loyal samurai led by Benkei and they head to the country of his only friend Hidehira Fujiwara. Near the border, after crossing the forest disguised as monks, their porter discovers that they are Yoshitsune and the six samurai and advises that the fearful Kajiwara and his soldiers are waiting for them at the border to arrest them. Yoshitsune disguises himself as a porter and at the barrier, Benkei has to convince Kajiwara that they are six monks traveling to collect donations to repair the Todai temple in Nara.\n\nCast\nDenjir\u014d \u014ck\u014dchi as Benkei\nTadayoshi Nishina as Yoshitsune\nSusumu Fujita as Togashi\nMasayuki Mori as Kamei\nTakashi Shimura as Kataoka\nKen'ichi Enomoto as porter\nAkitake K\u014dno as Ise\nYoshio Kosugi as Suruga\nDekao Yokoo as Hitachibo\nYasuo Hisamatsu as Kajiwara's messenger\nSh\u014dji Kiyokawa as Togashi's messenger\n\nProduction\nAccording to Stephen Prince, Akira Kurosawa was in preproduction on a film about the Battle of Nagashino and Oda Nobunaga's use of firearms to defeat an enemy clan mounted on horseback with swords and spears, but his vision surpassed his resources. In the last years of World War II, Japan was suffering from extreme privation and Toho had to make do with severely restricted means, such as spotty electricity often leaving them unable to light their sets. So Kurosawa switched to a new film, writing the script for The Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail in a single night and promising the studio he would need only one set to make it.\nPrince writes that Kurosawa subverts the famous twelfth-century incident that the film adapts by depicting Benkei in full Noh-style costume and \"furnishing the seriousness and reverence that everyone expects from the story\" with Noh flute and drum music throughout. The director also radically adds a new character in the porter played by comedian Ken'ichi Enomoto, whose \"jabbering undercuts the pomposity of the feudal rituals\". According to Prince, Japanese censors found it rude that Kurosawa was making fun of a sacred historical incident and, perhaps because of this, they did not give their file on the film to the censors of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers.\n\nRelease\nJapanese censors failed to give a file on the film to the censors of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, thus 1945's The Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail was banned as an \"illegal, unreported\" production. It was not released in Japan until 1952.\nThe Criterion Collection has released The Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail on DVD in North America as part of two 2009 Kurosawa-centered box sets; The First Films of Akira Kurosawa, the 23rd entry in their Eclipse series, and AK 100: 25 Films by Akira Kurosawa.\n\nAnalysis\nCritic David Conrad has said that the character of the porter, who does not exist in the original Noh or kabuki plays, prefigures Kurosawa's later commoner characters like the woodcutter in Rashomon and the villagers in Seven Samurai. \"The presence of a low-class character among the high and mighty helps anchor the story in familiar ground, and the porter is free to express thoughts that proper samurai leave unsaid... Each of Kurosawa's later jidaigeki, and many of his gendaigeki as well, would use characters of different castes and classes to achieve something similar to this dynamic.

It was selected as the Japanese entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 87th Academy Awards, but was not nominated.\n\nPlot\nIn a Japanese port town, Tatsuo Sato (G\u014d Ayano), a traumatized man, spends his days drifting aimlessly and his nights drinking himself to oblivion. Whiling his hours away at a pachinko parlor, he meets Takuji Ohshiro (Masaki Suda), a young man on parole who impulsively invites him to a shabby house on the outskirts of town. There, Tatsuo glimpses Takuji\u2019s bedridden father and callous mother, and meets his world-weary older sister Chinatsu Ohshiro (Chizuru Ikewaki). While immediately drawn to each other, romance is an unaffordable luxury for the emotionally closed-off Tatsuo and the disillusioned Chinatsu, who sells herself to provide for her family and keep her brother out of jail. As Tatsuo and Chinatsu take tentative steps towards a relationship, the happy-go-lucky Takuji latches onto Tatsuo, binding their fates.

In her roundup of films nominated for Best International Feature at the UK's Raindance Film Festival, Becca Spackman of Critics Associated wrote, \"An exploration into humanity and dependent tendencies, streaked with heartbreak and loss, this beautiful entry from Japan will definitely strike a chord with both audiences and critics alike.\" (The film later won the award.)\nThe film received positive responses from Japan's English-language newspapers. In his first review, Mark Schilling of The Japan Times singled out Chizuru Ikewaki's performance, noting, \"As Chinatsu, Ikewaki\u2019s performance is at once complex and transparent, drilling down into the essence of her character\u2019s longing and self-loathing, her capacity for love and her longing for oblivion.\" In a second review for The Japan Times, Schilling wrote, \"this romantic drama has deservedly been named as Japan\u2019s nominee for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.\" Meanwhile, Don Brown of The Asahi Shimbun wrote of director Mipo O, \"With her third and latest feature, [The Light Shines Only There], she has earned her spot as one of Japan\u2019s most promising directing talents.\"\n\nSee also\nList of submissions to the 87th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film\nList of Japanese submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website (in Japanese)\nOfficial website (English)\nThe Light Shines Only There at IMDb\nThe Light Shines Only There at AllMovie\nSoko nomi nite hikari kagayaku at Rotten Tomatoes","211":"The Most Beautiful (Japanese: \u4e00\u756a\u7f8e\u3057\u304f, Hepburn: Ichiban Utsukushiku) is a 1944 Japanese drama and propaganda film written and directed by Akira Kurosawa. The semidocumentary film follows a group of female volunteer workers at an optics factory during the Second World War, during which the film was produced.\n\nPlot\nSet during World War II, the film depicts the struggle of female volunteer workers to meet production targets at a precision optics factory in Hiratsuka. They drive themselves, individually and collectively, to exceed the targets set for them by the factory directors. The factory directors push the girls to be their best for their country. The girls live in a dormitory, and every day they march and sing songs about Japan's greatness while on the way to work. They live away from their parents but are happy to do so to serve their country. Every morning before work, they pledge that they will be loyal to Japan and will work to destroy the U.S. and Britain. There are encouraging signs posted everywhere about working hard for one's country in the factory. One of the girls gets sick and has to stay home, making her incredibly upset about missing work and cries because of the tremendous guilt she feels. She begs not to be sent home because she wants to keep working. Later on, a girl falls off the roof and gets badly injured. Yet she says she is delighted that she did not harm her hands and will come to work on crutches. Their productivity decreases, the girls know their reputation is at stake, and they must work harder. One of the girls says that \"one can't improve productivity without improving one's character.\" Watanabe's mother gets sick, her dad writes that under no circumstance should she come home, and her mother wants her to keep working, saying that her job is too important to leave. Near the end of the film, one of the girls gets a high temperature and tries to ignore it because she does not want to get sent home or stop working. Later on, Watanabe accidentally misplaces a lens and spends the entire night looking for it, she is worried her mistake will cost a soldier their life. The film ends with Watanabe's mom dying and her father telling her to stay at work. The factory directors ask her to go home. She refuses to go and cries while continuing her work.\n\nCast\nTakashi Shimura as Chief Goro Ishida\nSoji Kiyokawa as Soichi Yoshikawa\nIchiro Sugai as Ken Sanada\nTakako Irie as Noriko Mizushima\nSayuri Tanima as Yuriko Tanimura\nSachiko Ozaki as Sachiko Yamazaki\nAsako Suzuki as Asako Suzumura\nHaruko Toyama as Masako Koyama\nYoko Yaguchi as Tsuru Watanabe\n\nProduction\nAccording to Stephen Prince, Akira Kurosawa had been chosen by the navy to direct an action film about Zero fighter planes. But by 1943, he thought it unlikely that the navy would spare planes for a film as it was becoming clear that Japan would lose the war. So Kurosawa made this \"patriotic morale booster\" instead. The director shot The Most Beautiful with a \"semidocumentary approach.\" It was filmed on-location at the Nippon Kogaku factory in Hiratsuka, where he had the actresses live, work, and form a fife and drum corps.\nActress Yoko Yaguchi clashed over the alleged ways Kurosawa treated the actors. However, the pair found a connection, despite these clashes, and married in 1945. Although Prince writes that Kurosawa later chastised himself for doing so little to resist Japan's descent into militarism, the director also remarked that, of all his films, The Most Beautiful was dearest to him.\n\nReissues\nThe Criterion Collection has released The Most Beautiful on DVD in North America as part of two 2009 Kurosawa-centered box sets; The First Films of Akira Kurosawa, the 23rd entry in their Eclipse series, and AK 100: 25 Films by Akira Kurosawa.\n\nCritical reception\nPaul Anderer of Columbia University has commented on the subtext of the film having been released during the war years for Japan. Anderer said, \"It is as if Kurosawa himself were in this lineup (of directors under state scrutiny), frozen inside wartime, when any significant movement or resistance to the authority would be stillborn. Surrounded by a censorship apparatus far more resourceful and intimidating, he would later claim, than anything the American Occupation threw his way, he had few thematic or tonal options: historical tributes to Japanese spiritual and martial values (like Sanshiro Sugata and its weaker sequel), or patriotic odes to factory production and sacrificial domesticity (e.g., The Most Beautiful, 1944)\".\nCritics like Stephen Prince, Kurosawa translator Audie Bock, and historian David Conrad have argued that what is most striking about The Most Beautiful and Kurosawa's other wartime productions is the extent to which they complicate and even undercut the government's desired message. The Most Beautiful \"dutifully praises sacrifice but shrouds it in an air of futility\" by focusing on \"the individual emotional costs of war.\"\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nThe Most Beautiful at IMDb\nThe Most Beautiful at AllMovie\nThe Most Beautiful (in Japanese) at the Japanese Movie Database","212":"The New York Times (NYT) is an American daily newspaper based in New York City. The New York Times covers domestic, national, and international news, and publishes opinion pieces, investigative reports, and reviews. As one of the longest-running newspapers in the United States, the Times serves as one of the country's newspapers of record. As of 2023, The New York Times is the second-largest newspaper by print circulation in the United States, with 296,330 print subscribers. The Times has a 8.83 million online subscribers, the most of any newspaper in the United States. The New York Times is published by The New York Times Company; since 1896, the company has been chaired by the Ochs-Sulzberger family, whose current chairman and the paper's publisher is A. G. Sulzberger. The Times is headquartered at The New York Times Building in Midtown Manhattan.\nThe Times was founded as the conservative New-York Daily Times in 1851, and came to national recognition in the 1870s with its aggressive coverage of corrupt politician William M. Tweed. Following the Panic of 1893, Chattanooga Times publisher Adolph Ochs gained a controlling interest in the company. In 1935, Ochs was succeeded by his son-in-law, Arthur Hays Sulzberger, who began a push into European news. Sulzberger's son-in-law Arthur Ochs became publisher in 1963, adapting to a changing newspaper industry and introducing radical changes. The New York Times was involved in the landmark 1964 U.S. Supreme Court case New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, which restricted the ability of public officials to sue the media for defamation.\nIn 1971, The New York Times published the Pentagon Papers, an internal Department of Defense document detailing the United States's historical involvement in the Vietnam War, despite pushback from then-president Richard Nixon. In the landmark decision New York Times Co. v. United States (1971), the Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment guaranteed the right to publish the Pentagon Papers. In the 1980s, the Times began a two-decade progression to digital technology and launched nytimes.com in 1996. In the 21st century, The New York Times has shifted its publication online amid the global decline of newspapers.\nThe Times has expanded to several other publications, including The New York Times Magazine, The New York Times International Edition, and The New York Times Book Review. In addition, the paper has produced several television series, podcasts \u2014 including The Daily \u2014 and games through The New York Times Games. The New York Times has been involved in several controversies in its history. The Times maintains several regional bureaus staffed with journalists across six continents, and has received 137 Pulitzer Prizes as of 2023, the most of any publication, among other accolades.\n\nHistory\n1851\u20131896\nThe New York Times was established in 1851 by New-York Tribune journalists Henry Jarvis Raymond and George Jones. The Times experienced significant circulation, particularly among conservatives; New-York Tribune publisher Horace Greeley praised the New-York Daily Times. During the American Civil War, Times correspondents gathered information directly from Confederate states. In 1869, Jones inherited the paper from Raymond, who had changed its name to The New-York Times. Under Jones, the Times began to publish a series of articles criticizing Tammany Hall political boss William M. Tweed, despite vehement opposition from other New York newspapers. In 1871, The New-York Times published Tammany Hall's accounting books; Tweed was tried in 1873 and sentenced to twelve years in prison. The Times earned national recognition for its coverage of Tweed. In 1891, Jones died, creating a management imbroglio in which his children had insufficient business acumen to inherit the company and his will prevented an acquisition of the Times. Editor-in-chief Charles Ransom Miller, editorial editor Edward Cary, and correspondent George F. Spinney established a company to manage The New-York Times, but faced financial difficulties during the Panic of 1893.\n\n1896\u20131945\nIn August 1896, Chattanooga Times publisher Adolph Ochs acquired The New-York Times, implementing significant alterations to the newspaper's structure. Ochs established the Times as a merchant's newspaper and removed the hyphen from the newspaper's name. In 1905, The New York Times opened Times Tower, marking expansion. The Times experienced a political realignment in the 1910s amid several disagreements within the Republican Party. The New York Times reported on the sinking of the Titanic, as other newspapers were cautious about bulletins circulated by the Associated Press. Through managing editor Carr Van Anda, the Times focused on scientific advancements, reporting on Albert Einstein's then-unknown theory of general relativity and becoming involved in the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun. In April 1935, Ochs died, leaving his son-in-law Arthur Hays Sulzberger as publisher. The Great Depression forced Sulzberger to reduce The New York Times's operations, and developments in the New York newspaper landscape resulted in the formation of larger newspapers, such as the New York Herald Tribune and the New York World-Telegram. In contrast to Ochs, Sulzberger encouraged wirephotography.\nThe New York Times extensively covered World War II through large headlines, reporting on exclusive stories such as the Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat. Amid the war, Sulzberger began expanding the Times's operations further, acquiring WQXR-FM in 1944 \u2014 the first non-Times investment since the Jones era \u2014 and established a fashion show in Times Hall. Despite reductions as a result of conscription, The New York Times retained the largest journalism staff of any newspaper. The Times's print edition became available internationally during the war through the Army & Air Force Exchange Service; The New York Times Overseas Weekly later became available in Japan through The Asahi Shimbun and in Germany through the Frankfurter Zeitung. The international edition would develop into a separate newspaper. Journalist William L. Laurence publicized the atomic bomb race between the United States and Germany, resulting in the Federal Bureau of Investigation seizing copies of the Times. The United States government recruited Laurence to document the Manhattan Project in April 1945. Laurence became the only witness of the Manhattan Project, a detail realized by employees of The New York Times following the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.\n\n1945\u20131998\nFollowing World War II, The New York Times continued to expand. The Times was subject to investigations from the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, a McCarthyist subcommittee that investigated purported communism from within press institutions. Arthur Hays Sulzberger's decision to dismiss a copyreader who had pleaded the Fifth Amendment drew ire from within the Times and from external organizations. In April 1961, Sulzberger resigned, appointing his son-in-law, The New York Times Company president Orvil Dryfoos. Under Dryfoos, The New York Times established a newspaper based in Los Angeles. In 1962, the implementation of automated printing presses in response to increasing costs mounted fears over technological unemployment. The New York Typographical Union staged a strike in December, altering the media consumption of New Yorkers. The strike left New York with three remaining newspapers \u2014 the Times, the Daily News, and the New York Post \u2014 by its conclusion in March 1963. In May, Dryfoos died of a heart ailment. Following weeks of ambiguity, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger became The New York Times's publisher.\nTechnological advancements leveraged by newspapers such as the Los Angeles Times and improvements in coverage from The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal necessitated adaptations to nascent computing. The New York Times published \"Heed Their Rising Voices\" in 1960, a full-page advertisement purchased by supporters of Martin Luther King Jr. criticizing law enforcement in Montgomery, Alabama for their response to the civil rights movement. Montgomery Public Safety commissioner L. B. Sullivan sued the Times for defamation. In New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the verdict in Alabama county court and the Supreme Court of Alabama violated the First Amendment. The decision is considered to be landmark. After financial losses, The New York Times ended its international edition, acquiring a stake in the Paris Herald Tribune, forming the International Herald Tribune. The Times initially published the Pentagon Papers, facing opposition from then-president Richard Nixon. The Supreme Court ruled in The New York Times's favor in New York Times Co. v. United States (1971), allowing the Times and The Washington Post to publish the papers.\nThe New York Times remained cautious in its initial coverage of the Watergate scandal. As Congress began investigating the scandal, the Times furthered its coverage, publishing details on the Huston Plan, alleged wiretapping of reporters and officials, and testimony from James W. McCord Jr. that the Committee for the Re-Election of the President paid the conspirators off. The exodus of readers to suburban New York newspapers, such as Newsday and Gannett papers, adversely affected The New York Times's circulation. Contemporary newspapers balked at additional sections; Time devoted a cover for its criticism and New York wrote that the Times was engaging in \"middle-class self-absorption\". The New York Times, the Daily News, and the New York Post were the subject of a strike in 1978, allowing emerging newspapers to leverage halted coverage. The Times deliberately avoided coverage of the AIDS epidemic, running its first front-page article in May 1983. Max Frankel's editorial coverage of the epidemic, with mentions of anal intercourse, contrasted with then-executive editor A. M. Rosenthal's puritan approach, intentionally avoiding descriptions of the luridity of gay venues.\nFollowing years of waning interest in The New York Times, Sulzberger resigned in January 1992, appointing his son, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., as publisher. The Internet represented a generational shift within the Times; Sulzberger, who negotiated The New York Times Company's acquisition of The Boston Globe in 1993, derided the Internet, while his son expressed antithetical views. @times appeared on America Online's website in May 1994 as an extension of The New York Times, featuring news articles, film reviews, sports news, and business articles. Despite opposition, several employees of the Times had begun to access the Internet. The online success of publications that traditionally co-existed with the Times \u2014 such as America Online, Yahoo, and CNN \u2014 and the expansion of websites such as Monster.com and Craigslist that threatened The New York Times's classified advertisement model increased efforts to develop a website. nytimes.com debuted on January 19 and was formally announced three days later. The Times published domestic terrorist Ted Kaczynski's essay Industrial Society and Its Future in 1995, contributing to his arrest after his brother David recognized the essay's penmanship.\n\n1998\u2013present\nFollowing the establishment of nytimes.com, The New York Times retained its journalistic hesitancy under executive editor Joseph Lelyveld, refusing to publish an article reporting on the Clinton\u2013Lewinsky scandal from Drudge Report. nytimes.com editors conflicted with print editors on several occasions, including wrongfully naming security guard Richard Jewell as the suspect in the Centennial Olympic Park bombing and covering the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in greater detail than the print edition. The New York Times Electronic Media Company was adversely affected by the dot-com crash. The Times extensively covered the September 11 attacks. The following day's print issue contained sixty-six articles, the work of over three hundred dispatched reporters. Journalist Judith Miller was the recipient of a package containing a white powder during the 2001 anthrax attacks, furthering anxiety within The New York Times. In September 2002, Miller and military correspondent Michael R. Gordon wrote an article for the Times claiming that Iraq had purchased aluminum tubes. The article was cited by then-president George W. Bush to claim that Iraq was constructing weapons of mass destruction; the theoretical use of aluminum tubes to produce nuclear material was speculation. In March 2003, the United States invaded Iraq, beginning the Iraq War.\nThe New York Times attracted controversy after thirty-six articles from journalist Jayson Blair were discovered to be plagiarized. Criticism over then-executive editor Howell Raines and then-managing editor Gerald M. Boyd mounted following the scandal, culminating in a town hall in which a deputy editor criticized Raines for failing to question Blair's sources in article he wrote on the D.C. sniper attacks. In June 2003, Raines and Boyd resigned. Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr. appointed Bill Keller as executive editor. Miller continued to report on the Iraq War as a journalistic embed covering the country's weapons of mass destruction program. Keller and then-Washington bureau chief Jill Abramson unsuccessfully attempted to subside criticism. Conservative media criticized the Times over its coverage of missing explosives from the Al Qa'qaa weapons facility. An article in December 2005 disclosing warrantless surveillance by the National Security Agency contributed to further criticism from the George W. Bush administration and the Senate's refusal to renew the Patriot Act. In the Plame affair, a Central Intelligence Agency inquiry found that Miller had become aware of Valerie Plame's identity through then-vice president Dick Cheney's chief of staff Scooter Libby, resulting in Miller's resignation.\nDuring the Great Recession, The New York Times suffered significant fiscal difficulties as a consequence of the subprime mortgage crisis and a decline in classified advertising. Exacerbated by Rupert Murdoch's revitalization of The Wall Street Journal through his acquisition of Dow Jones & Company, The New York Times Company began enacting measures to reduce the newsroom budget. The company was forced to borrow $250 million (equivalent to $353.79 million in 2023) from Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim and fired over one hundred employees by 2010. nytimes.com's coverage of the Eliot Spitzer prostitution scandal, resulting in the resignation of then-New York governor Eliot Spitzer, furthered the legitimacy of the website as a journalistic medium. The Times's economic downturn renewed discussions of an online paywall; The New York Times implemented a paywall in March 2011. Abramson succeeded Keller, continuing her characteristic investigations into corporate and government malfeasance into the Times's coverage. Following conflicts with newly appointed chief executive Mark Thompson's ambitions, Abramson was dismissed by Sulzberger Jr., who named Dean Baquet as her replacement.\nLeading up to the 2016 presidential election, The New York Times elevated the Hillary Clinton email controversy and the Uranium One controversy; national security correspondent Michael S. Schmidt initially wrote an article in March 2015 stating that Hillary Clinton had used a private email server as secretary of state. Donald Trump's upset victory contributed to an increase in subscriptions to the Times. The New York Times experienced unprecedented indignation from Trump, who referred to publications such as the Times as \"enemies of the people\" at the Conservative Political Action Conference and tweeting his disdain for the newspaper and CNN. In October 2017, The New York Times published an article by journalists Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey alleging that dozens of women had accused film producer and The Weinstein Company co-chairman Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct. The investigation resulted in Weinstein's resignation and conviction, precipitated the Weinstein effect, and served as a catalyst for the #MeToo movement. The New York Times Company vacated the public editor position and eliminated the copy desk in November. Sulzberger Jr. announced his resignation in December 2017, appointing his son, A. G. Sulzberger, as publisher.\nTrump's relationship \u2014 equally diplomatic and negative \u2014 marked Sulzberger's tenure. In September 2018, The New York Times published \"I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration\", an anonymous essay by a self-described Trump administration official later revealed to be Department of Homeland Security chief of staff Miles Taylor. The animosity \u2014 which extended to nearly three hundred instances of Trump disparaging the Times by May 2019 \u2014 culminated in Trump ordering federal agencies to cancel their subscriptions to The New York Times and The Washington Post in October 2019. Trump's tax returns have been the subject of three separate investigations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Times began implementing data services and graphs. On May 23, 2020, The New York Times's front page solely featured U.S. Deaths Near 100,000, An Incalculable Loss, a subset of the 100,000 people in the United States who died of COVID-19, the first time that the Times's front page lacked images since they were introduced. Since 2020, The New York Times has focused on broader diversification, developing online games and producing television series. The New York Times Company acquired The Athletic in January 2022.\n\nOrganization\nManagement\nSince 1896, The New York Times has been published by the Ochs-Sulzberger family, having previously been published by Henry Jarvis Raymond until 1869 and by George Jones until 1896. Adolph Ochs published the Times until his death in 1935, when he was succeeded by his son-in-law, Arthur Hays Sulzberger. Sulzberger was publisher until 1961 and was succeeded by Orvil Dryfoos, his son-in-law, who served in the position until his death in 1963. Arthur Ochs Sulzberger succeeded Dryfoos until his resignation in 1992. His son, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., served as publisher until 2018. The New York Times's current publisher is A. G. Sulzberger, Sulzberger Jr.'s son. As of 2023, the Times's executive editor is Joseph Kahn and the paper's managing editors are Marc Lacey and Carolyn Ryan, having been appointed in June 2022. The New York Times's deputy managing editors are Sam Dolnick, Monica Drake, and Steve Duenes, and the paper's assistant managing editors are Matthew Ericson, Jonathan Galinsky, Hannah Poferl, Sam Sifton, Karron Skog, and Michael Slackman.\nThe New York Times is owned by The New York Times Company, a publicly traded company. The New York Times Company, in addition to the Times, owns Wirecutter, The Athletic, The New York Times Cooking, and The New York Times Games, and acquired Serial Productions and Audm. The New York Times Company holds undisclosed minority investments in multiple other businesses, and formerly owned The Boston Globe and several radio and television stations. The New York Times Company is majority-owned by the Ochs-Sulzberger family through elevated shares in the company's dual-class stock structure held largely in a trust, in effect since the 1950s; as of 2022, the family holds ninety-five percent of The New York Times Company's Class B shares, allowing it to elect seventy percent of the company's board of directors. Class A shareholders have restrictive voting rights. As of 2023, The New York Times Company's chief executive is Meredith Kopit Levien, the company's former chief operating officer who was appointed in September 2020.\n\nJournalists\nAs of March 2023, The New York Times Company employs 5,800 individuals, including 1,700 journalists according to deputy managing editor Sam Dolnick. Journalists for The New York Times may not run for public office, provide financial support to political candidates or causes, endorse candidates, or demonstrate public support for causes or movements. Journalists are subject to the guidelines established in \"Ethical Journalism\" and \"Guidelines on Integrity\". According to the former, Times journalists must abstain from using sources with a personal relationship to them and must not accept reimbursements or inducements from individuals who may be written about in The New York Times, with exceptions for gifts of nominal value. The latter requires attribution and exact quotations, though exceptions are made for linguistic anomalies. Staff writers are expected to ensure the veracity of all written claims, but may delegate researching obscure facts to the research desk. In March 2021, the Times established a committee to avoid journalistic conflicts of interest with work written for The New York Times, following columnist David Brooks's resignation from the Aspen Institute for his undisclosed work on the initiative Weave.\n\nEditorial board\nThe New York Times editorial board was established in 1896 by Adolph Ochs. With the opinion department, the editorial board is independent of the newsroom. Then-editor-in-chief Charles Ransom Miller served as opinion editor from 1883 until his death in 1922. Rollo Ogden succeeded Miller until his death in 1937. From 1937 to 1938, John Huston Finley served as opinion editor; in a prearranged plan, Charles Merz succeeded Finley. Merz served in the position until his retirement in 1961. John Bertram Oakes served as opinion editor from 1961 to 1976, when then-publisher Arthur Ochs Sulzberger appointed Max Frankel. Frankel served in the position until 1986, when he was appointed as executive editor. Jack Rosenthal was the opinion editor from 1986 to 1993. Howell Raines succeeded Rosenthal until 2001, when he was made executive editor. Gail Collins succeeded Raines until her resignation in 2006. From 2007 to 2016, Andrew Rosenthal was the opinion editor. James Bennet succeeded Rosenthal until his resignation in 2020. As of July 2024, the editorial board comprises thirteen opinion writers. The New York Times's opinion editor is Kathleen Kingsbury and the deputy opinion editor is Patrick Healy.\nThe New York Times's editorial board was initially opposed to liberal beliefs, opposing women's suffrage in 1900 and 1914. The editorial board began to espouse progressive beliefs during Oakes' tenure, conflicting with the Ochs-Sulzberger family, of which Oakes was a member as Adolph Ochs's nephew; in 1976, Oakes publicly disagreed with Sulzberger's endorsement of Daniel Patrick Moynihan over Bella Abzug in the 1976 Senate Democratic primaries in a letter sent from Martha's Vineyard. Under Rosenthal, the editorial board took positions supporting assault weapons legislation and the legalization of marijuana, but publicly criticized the Obama administration over its portrayal of terrorism. In presidential elections, The New York Times has endorsed a total of twelve Republican candidates and thirty Democratic candidates, and has endorsed the Democrat in every election since 1960. With the exception of Wendell Willkie, Republicans endorsed by the Times have won the presidency. In 2016, the editorial board issued an anti-endorsement against Donald Trump for the first time in its history. \nIn February 2020, the editorial board reduced its presence from several editorials each day to occasional editorials for events deemed particularly significant. Since August 2024, the board no longer endorses candidates in local or congressional races in New York.\n\nUnionization\nSince 1940, editorial, media, and technology workers of The New York Times have been represented by the New York Times Guild. The Times Guild, along with the Times Tech Guild, are represented by the NewsGuild-CWA. In 1940, Arthur Hays Sulzberger was called upon by the National Labor Relations Board amid accusations that he had discouraged Guild membership in the Times. Over the next few years, the Guild would ratify several contracts, expanding to editorial and news staff in 1942 and maintenance workers in 1943. The New York Times Guild has walked out several times in its history, including for six and a half hours in 1981 and in 2017, when copy editors and reporters walked out at lunchtime in response to the elimination of the copy desk. On December 7, 2022, the union held a one-day strike, the first interruption to The New York Times since 1978. The New York Times Guild reached an agreement in May 2023 to increase minimum salaries for employees and a retroactive bonus. The Times Tech Guild is the largest technology union with collective bargaining rights in the United States.\n\nContent\nCirculation\nAs of August 2024, The New York Times has 10.8 million subscribers, with 10.2 million online subscribers and 600,000 print subscribers, the second-largest newspaper by print circulation in the United States behind The Wall Street Journal. The New York Times Company intends to have fifteen million subscribers by 2027. The Times's shift towards subscription-based revenue with the debut of an online paywall in 2011 contributed to subscription revenue exceeding advertising revenue the following year, furthered by the 2016 presidential election and Donald Trump. In 2022, Vox wrote that The New York Times's subscribers skew \"older, richer, whiter, and more liberal\"; to reflect the general population of the United States, the Times has attempted to alter its audience by acquiring The Athletic, investing in verticals such as The New York Times Games, and beginning a marketing campaign showing diverse subscribers to the Times. The New York Times Company chief executive Meredith Kopit Levien stated that the average age of subscribers has remained constant.\n\nNewsletters\nIn October 2001, The New York Times began publishing DealBook, a financial newsletter edited by Andrew Ross Sorkin. The Times had intended to publish the newsletter in September, but delayed its debut following the September 11 attacks. A website for DealBook was established in March 2006. The New York Times began shifting towards DealBook as part of the newspaper's financial coverage in November 2010 with a renewed website and a presence in the Times's print edition. In 2011, the Times began hosting the DealBook Summit, an annual conference hosted by Sorkin. During the COVID-19 pandemic, The New York Times hosted the DealBook Online Summit in 2020 and 2021. The 2022 DealBook Summit featured \u2014 among other speakers \u2014 former vice president Mike Pence and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, culminating in an interview with former FTX chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried; FTX had filed for bankruptcy several weeks prior. The 2023 DealBook Summit's speakers included vice president Kamala Harris, Israeli president Isaac Herzog, and businessman Elon Musk.\nIn June 2010, The New York Times licensed the political blog FiveThirtyEight in a three-year agreement. The blog, written by Nate Silver, had garnered attention during the 2008 presidential election for predicting the elections in forty-nine of fifty states. FiveThirtyEight appeared on nytimes.com in August. According to Silver, several offers were made for the blog; Silver wrote that a merger of unequals must allow for editorial sovereignty and resources from the acquirer, comparing himself to Groucho Marx. According to The New Republic, FiveThirtyEight drew as much as a fifth of the traffic to nytimes.com during the 2012 presidential election. In July 2013, FiveThirtyEight was sold to ESPN. In an article following Silver's exit, public editor Margaret Sullivan wrote that he was disruptive to the Times's culture for his perspective on probability-based predictions and scorn for polling \u2014 having stated that punditry is \"fundamentally useless\", comparing him to Billy Beane, who implemented sabermetrics in baseball. According to Sullivan, his work was criticized by several notable political journalists.\nThe New Republic obtained a memo in November 2013 revealing then-Washington bureau chief David Leonhardt's ambitions to establish a data-driven newsletter with presidential historian Michael Beschloss, graphic designer Amanda Cox, economist Justin Wolfers, and The New Republic journalist Nate Cohn. By March, Leonhardt had amassed fifteen employees from within The New York Times; the newsletter's staff included individuals who had created the Times's dialect quiz, fourth down analyzer, and a calculator for determining buying or renting a home. The Upshot debuted in April 2014. Fast Company reviewed an article about Illinois Secure Choice \u2014 a state-funded retirement saving system \u2014 as \"neither a terse news item, nor a formal financial advice column, nor a politically charged response to economic policy\", citing its informal and neutral tone. The Upshot developed \"the needle\" for the 2016 presidential election and 2020 presidential elections, a thermometer dial displaying the probability of a candidate winning. In January 2016, Cox was named editor of The Upshot. Kevin Quealy was named editor in June 2022.\n\nPolitical positions\nAccording to an internal readership poll conducted by The New York Times in 2019, eighty-four percent of readers identified as liberal.\n\nCrossword\nIn February 1942, The New York Times crossword debuted in The New York Times Magazine; according to Richard Shepard, the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 convinced then-publisher Arthur Hays Sulzberger of the necessity of a crossword.\n\nCooking\nThe New York Times has published recipes since the 1850s and has had a separate food section since the 1940s. In 1961, restaurant critic Craig Claiborne published The New York Times Cookbook, an unauthorized cookbook that drew from the Times's recipes. Since 2010, former food editor Amanda Hesser has published The Essential New York Times Cookbook, a compendium of recipes from The New York Times. The Innovation Report in 2014 revealed that the Times had attempted to establish a cooking website since 1998, but faced difficulties with the absence of a defined data structure. In September 2014, The New York Times introduced NYT Cooking, an application and website. Edited by food editor Sam Sifton, the Times's cooking website features 21,000 recipes as of 2022. NYT Cooking features videos as part of an effort by Sifton to hire two former Tasty employees from BuzzFeed. In August 2023, NYT Cooking added personalized recommendations through the cosine similarity of text embeddings of recipe titles. The website also features no-recipe recipes, a concept proposed by Sifton.\nIn May 2016, The New York Times Company announced a partnership with startup Chef'd to form a meal delivery service that would deliver ingredients from The New York Times Cooking recipes to subscribers; Chef'd shut down in July 2018 after failing to accrue capital and secure financing. The Hollywood Reporter reported in September 2022 that the Times would expand its delivery options to US$95 cooking kits curated by chefs such as Nina Compton, Chintan Pandya, and Naoko Takei Moore. That month, the staff of NYT Cooking went on tour with Compton, Pandya, and Moore in Los Angeles, New Orleans, and New York City, culminating in a food festival. In addition, The New York Times offered its own wine club originally operated by the Global Wine Company. The New York Times Wine Club was established in August 2009, during a dramatic decrease in advertising revenue. By 2021, the wine club was managed by Lot18, a company that provides proprietary labels. Lot18 managed the Williams Sonoma Wine Club and its own wine club Tasting Room.\n\nArchives\nThe New York Times archives its articles in a basement annex beneath its building known as \"the morgue\", a venture started by managing editor Carr Van Anda in 1907. The morgue comprises news clippings, a pictures library, and the Times's book and periodicals library. As of 2014, it is the largest library of any media company, dating back to 1851. In November 2018, The New York Times partnered with Google to digitize the Archival Library. Additionally, The New York Times has maintained a virtual microfilm reader known as TimesMachine since 2014. The service launched with archives from 1851 to 1980; in 2016, TimesMachine expanded to include archives from 1981 to 2002. The Times built a pipeline to take in TIFF images, article metadata in XML and an INI file of Cartesian geometry describing the boundaries of the page, and convert it into a PNG of image tiles and JSON containing the information in the XML and INI files. The image tiles are generated using GDAL and displayed using Leaflet, using data from a content delivery network. The Times ran optical character recognition on the articles using Tesseract and shingled and fuzzy string matched the result.\n\nContent management system\nThe New York Times uses a proprietary content management system known as Scoop for its online content and the Microsoft Word-based content management system CCI for its print content. Scoop was developed in 2008 to serve as a secondary content management system for editors working in CCI to publish their content on the Times's website; as part of The New York Times's online endeavors, editors now write their content in Scoop and send their work to CCI for print publication. Since its introduction, Scoop has superseded several processes within the Times, including print edition planning and collaboration, and features tools such as multimedia integration, notifications, content tagging, and drafts. The New York Times uses private articles for high-profile opinion pieces, such as those written by Russian president Vladimir Putin and actress Angelina Jolie, and for high-level investigations. In January 2012, the Times released Integrated Content Editor (ICE), a revision tracking tool for WordPress and TinyMCE. ICE is integrated within the Times's workflow by providing a unified text editor for print and online editors, reducing the divide between print and online operations.\nBy 2017, The New York Times began developing a new authoring tool to its content management system known as Oak, in an attempt to further the Times's visual efforts in articles and reduce the discrepancy between the mediums in print and online articles. The system reduces the input of editors and supports additional visual mediums in an editor that resembles the appearance of the article. Oak is based on ProseMirror, a JavaScript rich-text editor toolkit, and retains the revision tracking and commenting functionalities of The New York Times's previous systems. Additionally, Oak supports predefined article headers. In 2019, Oak was updated to support collaborative editing using Firebase to update editors's cursor status. Several Google Cloud Functions and Google Cloud Tasks allow articles to be previewed as they will be printed, and the Times's primary MySQL database is regularly updated to update editors on the article status.\n\nStyle and design\nStyle guide\nSince 1895, The New York Times has maintained a manual of style in several forms. The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage was published on the Times's intranet in 1999.\nThe New York Times uses honorifics when referring to individuals. With the AP Stylebook's removal of honorifics in 2000 and The Wall Street Journal's omission of courtesy titles in May 2023, the Times is the only national newspaper that continues to use honorifics. According to former copy editor Merrill Perlman, The New York Times continues to use honorifics as a \"sign of civility\". The Times's use of courtesy titles led to an apocryphal rumor that the paper had referred to singer Meat Loaf as \"Mr. Loaf\". Several exceptions have been made; the former sports section and The New York Times Book Review do not use honorifics. A leaked memo following the killing of Osama bin Laden in May 2011 revealed that editors were given a last-minute instruction to omit the honorific from Osama bin Laden's name, consistent with deceased figures of historic significance, such as Adolf Hitler, Napoleon, and Vladimir Lenin. The New York Times uses academic and military titles for individuals prominently serving in that position. In 1986, the Times began to use Ms, and introduced the gender-neutral title Mx. in 2015. The New York Times uses initials when a subject has expressed a preference, such as Donald Trump.\nThe New York Times maintains a strict but not absolute obscenity policy, including phrases. In a review of the Canadian hardcore punk band Fucked Up, music critic Kelefa Sanneh wrote that the band's name\u2014entirely rendered in asterisks\u2014would not be printed in the Times \"unless an American president, or someone similar, says it by mistake\"; The New York Times did not repeat then-vice president Dick Cheney's use of \"fuck\" against then-senator Patrick Leahy in 2004 or then-vice president Joe Biden's remarks that the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 was a \"big fucking deal\". The Times's profanity policy has been tested by former president Donald Trump. The New York Times published Trump's Access Hollywood tape in October 2016, containing the words \"fuck\", \"pussy\", \"bitch\", and \"tits\", the first time the publication had published an expletive on its front page, and repeated an explicit phrase for fellatio stated by then-White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci in July 2017. The New York Times omitted Trump's use of the phrase \"shithole countries\" from its headline in favor of \"vulgar language\" in January 2018. The Times banned certain words, such as \"bitch\", \"whore\", and \"sluts\", from Wordle in 2022.\n\nHeadlines\nJournalists for The New York Times do not write their own headlines, but rather copy editors who specifically write headlines. The Times's guidelines insist headline editors get to the main point of an article but avoid giving away endings, if present. Other guidelines include using slang \"sparingly\", avoiding tabloid headlines, not ending a line on a preposition, article, or adjective, and chiefly, not to pun. The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage states that wordplay, such as \"Rubber Industry Bounces Back\", is to be tested on a colleague as a canary is to be tested in a coal mine; \"when no song bursts forth, start rewriting\". The New York Times has amended headlines due to controversy. In 2019, following two back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, the Times used the headline, \"Trump Urges Unity vs. Racism\", to describe then-president Donald Trump's words after the shootings. After criticism from FiveThirtyEight founder Nate Silver, the headline was changed to, \"Assailing Hate But Not Guns\".\nOnline, The New York Times's headlines do not face the same length restrictions as headlines that appear in print; print headlines must fit within a column, often six words. Additionally, headlines must \"break\" properly, containing a complete thought on each line without splitting up prepositions and adverbs. Writers may edit a headline to fit an article more aptly if further developments occur. The Times uses A\/B testing for articles on the front page, placing two headlines against each other. At the end of the test, the headlines that receives more traffic is chosen. The alteration of a headline regarding intercepted Russian data used in the Mueller special counsel investigation was noted by Trump in a March 2017 interview with Time, in which he claimed that the headline used the word \"wiretapped\" in the print version of the paper on January 20, while the digital article on January 19 omitted the word. The headline was intentionally changed in the print version to use \"wiretapped\" in order to fit within the print guidelines.\n\nNameplate\nThe nameplate of The New York Times has been unaltered since 1967. In creating the initial nameplate, Henry Jarvis Raymond sought to model The London Times, which used a Blackletter style called Textura, popularized following the fall of the Western Roman Empire and regional variations of Alcuin's script, as well as a period. With the change to The New-York Times on September 14, 1857, the nameplate followed. Under George Jones, the terminals of the \"N\", \"r\", and \"s\" were intentionally exaggerated into swashes. The nameplate in the January 15, 1894, issue trimmed the terminals once more, smoothed the edges, and turned the stem supporting the \"T\" into an ornament. The hyphen was dropped on December 1, 1896, after Adolph Ochs purchased the paper. The descender of the \"h\" was shortened on December 30, 1914. The largest change to the nameplate was introduced on February 21, 1967, when type designer Ed Benguiat redesigned the logo, most prominently turning the arrow ornament into a diamond. Notoriously, the new logo dropped the period that remained with the Times up until that point; one reader compared the omission of the period to \"performing plastic surgery on Helen of Troy.\" Picture editor John Radosta worked with a New York University professor to determine that dropping the period saved the paper US$41.28 (equivalent to $377.21 in 2023).\n\nPrint edition\nDesign and layout\nAs of December 2023, The New York Times has printed sixty thousand issues, a statistic represented in the paper's masthead to the right of the volume number, the Times's years in publication written in Roman numerals. The volume and issues are separated by four dots representing the edition number of that issue; on the day of the 2000 presidential election, the Times was revised four separate times, necessitating the use of an em dash in place of an ellipsis. The em dash issue was printed hundreds times over before being replaced by the one-dot issue. Despite efforts by newsroom employees to recycle copies sent to The New York Times's office, several copies were kept, including one put on display at the Museum at The Times. From February 7, 1898, to December 31, 1999, the Times's issue number was incorrect by five hundred issues, an error suspected by The Atlantic to be the result of a careless front page type editor. The misreporting was noticed by news editor Aaron Donovan, who was calculating the number of issues in a spreadsheet and noticed the discrepancy. The New York Times celebrated fifty thousand issues on March 14, 1995, an observance that should have occurred on July 26, 1996.\nThe New York Times has reduced the physical size of its print edition while retaining its broadsheet format. The New-York Daily Times debuted at 18 inches (460 mm) across. By the 1950s, the Times was being printed at 16 inches (410 mm) across. In 1953, an increase in paper costs to US$10 (equivalent to $113.88 in 2023) a ton increased newsprint costs to US$21.7 million (equivalent to $308,616,417.91 in 2023) On December 28, 1953, the pages were reduced to 15.5 inches (390 mm). On February 14, 1955, a further reduction to 15 inches (380 mm) occurred, followed by 14.5 and 13.5 inches (370 and 340 mm). On August 6, 2007, the largest cut occurred when the pages were reduced to 12 inches (300 mm), a decision that other broadsheets had previously considered. Then-executive editor Bill Keller stated that a narrower paper would be more beneficial to the reader but acknowledged a net loss in article space of five percent. In 1985, The New York Times Company established a minority stake in a US$21.7 million (equivalent to $308,616,417.91 in 2023) newsprint plant in Clermont, Quebec through Donahue Malbaie. The company sold its equity interest in Donahue Malbaie in 2017.\nThe New York Times often uses large, bolded headlines for major events. For the print version of the Times, these headlines are written by one copy editor, reviewed by two other copy editors, approved by the masthead editors, and polished by other print editors. The process is completed before 8 p.m., but it may be repeated if further development occur, as did take place during the 2020 presidential election. On the day Joe Biden was declared the winner, The New York Times utilized a \"hammer headline\" reading, \"Biden Beats Trump\", in all caps and bolded. A dozen journalists discussed several potential headlines, such as \"It's Biden\" or \"Biden's Moment\", and prepared for a Donald Trump victory, in which they would use \"Trump Prevails\". During Trump's first impeachment, the Times drafted the hammer headline, \"Trump Impeached\". The New York Times altered the ligatures between the E and the A, as not doing so would leave a noticeable gap due to the stem of the A sloping away from the E. The Times reused the tight kerning for \"Biden Beats Trump\" and Trump's second impeachment, which simply read, \"Impeached\".\nIn cases where two major events occur on the same day or immediately after each other, The New York Times has used a \"paddle wheel\" headline, where both headlines are used but split by a line. The term dates back to August 8, 1959, when it was revealed that the United States was monitoring Soviet missile firings and when Explorer 6 \u2014 shaped like a paddle wheel \u2014 launched. Since then, the paddle wheel has been used several times, including on January 21, 1981, when Ronald Reagan was sworn in minutes before Iran released fifty-two American hostages, ending the Iran hostage crisis. At the time, most newspapers favored the end of the hostage crisis, but the Times placed the inauguration above the crisis. Since 1981, the paddle wheel has been used twice; on July 26, 2000, when the 2000 Camp David Summit ended without an agreement and when Bush announced that Dick Cheney would be his running mate, and on June 24, 2016, when the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum passed, beginning Brexit, and when the Supreme Court deadlocked in United States v. Texas.\nThe New York Times has run editorials from its editorial board on the front page twice. On June 13, 1920, the Times ran an editorial opposing Warren G. Harding, who was nominated during that year's Republican Party presidential primaries. Amid growing acceptance to run editorials on the front pages from publications such as the Detroit Free Press, The Patriot-News, The Arizona Republic, and The Indianapolis Star, The New York Times ran an editorial on its front page on December 5, 2015, following a terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California, in which fourteen people were killed. The editorial advocates for the prohibition of \"slightly modified combat rifles\" used in the San Bernardino shooting and \"certain kinds of ammunition\". Conservative figures, including Texas senator Ted Cruz, The Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol, Fox & Friends co-anchor Steve Doocy, and then-New Jersey governor Chris Christie criticized the Times. Talk radio host Erick Erickson acquired an issue of The New York Times to fire several rounds into the paper, posting a picture online.\n\nPrinting process\nSince 1997, The New York Times's primary distribution center is located in College Point, Queens. The facility is 300,000 sq ft (28,000 m2) and employs 170 people as of 2017. The College Point distribution center prints 300,000 to 800,000 newspapers daily. On most occasions, presses start before 11 p.m. and finish before 3 a.m. A robotic crane grabs a roll of newsprint and several rollers ensure ink can be printed on paper. The final newspapers are wrapped in plastic and shipped out. As of 2018, the College Point facility accounted for 41 percent of production. Other copies are printed at 26 other publications, such as The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, The Dallas Morning News, The Santa Fe New Mexican, and the Courier Journal. With the decline of newspapers, particularly regional publications, the Times must travel further; for example, newspapers for Hawaii are flown from San Francisco on United Airlines, and Sunday papers are flown from Los Angeles on Hawaiian Airlines. Computer glitches, mechanical issues, and weather phenomena affect circulation but do not stop the paper from reaching customers. The College Point facility prints over two dozen other papers, including The Wall Street Journal and USA Today.\nThe New York Times has halted its printing process several times to account for major developments. The first printing stoppage occurred on March 31, 1968, when then-president Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he would not seek a second term. Other press stoppages include May 19, 1994, for the death of former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and July 17, 1996, for Trans World Airlines Flight 800. The 2000 presidential election necessitated two press stoppages. Al Gore appeared to concede on November 8, forcing then-executive editor Joseph Lelyveld to stop the Times's presses to print a new headline, \"Bush Appears to Defeat Gore\", with a story that stated George W. Bush was elected president. However, Gore held off his concession speech over doubts over Florida. Lelyveld reran the headline, \"Bush and Gore Vie for an Edge\". Since 2000, three printing stoppages have been issued for the death of William Rehnquist on September 3, 2005, for the killing of Osama bin Laden on May 1, 2011, and for the passage of the Marriage Equality Act in the New York State Assembly and subsequent signage by then-governor Andrew Cuomo on June 24, 2011.\n\nOnline platforms\nWebsite\nThe New York Times website is hosted at nytimes.com. It has undergone several major redesigns and infrastructure developments since its debut. In April 2006, The New York Times redesigned its website with an emphasis on multimedia. In preparation for Super Tuesday in February 2008, the Times developed a live election system using the Associated Press's File Transfer Protocol (FTP) service and a Ruby on Rails application; nytimes.com experienced its largest traffic on Super Tuesday and the day after.\n\nApplications\nThe NYTimes application debuted with the introduction of the App Store on July 10, 2008. Engadget's Scott McNulty wrote critically of the app, negatively comparing it to The New York Times's mobile website. An iPad version with select articles was released on April 3, 2010, with the release of the first-generation iPad. In October, The New York Times expanded NYT Editors' Choice to include the paper's full articles. NYT for iPad was free until 2011. The Times applications on iPhone and iPad began offering in-app subscriptions in July 2011. The Times released a web application for iPad \u2014 featuring a format summarizing trending headlines on Twitter \u2014 and a Windows 8 application in October 2012.\nEfforts to ensure profitability through an online magazine and a \"Need to Know\" subscription emerged in Adweek in July 2013. In March 2014, The New York Times announced three applications \u2014 NYT Now, an application that offers pertinent news in a blog format, and two unnamed applications, later known as NYT Opinion and NYT Cooking \u2014 to diversify its product laterals.\n\nPodcasts\nThe New York Times manages several podcasts, including multiple podcasts with Serial Productions. The Times's longest-running podcast is The Book Review Podcast, debuting as Inside The New York Times Book Review in April 2006.\nThe New York Times's defining podcast is The Daily, a daily news podcast hosted by Michael Barbaro and, since March 2022, Sabrina Tavernise. The podcast debuted on February 1, 2017.\nIn October 2021, The New York Times began testing \"New York Times Audio\", an application featuring podcasts from the Times, audio versions of articles \u2014 including from other publications through Audm, and archives from This American Life. The application debuted in May 2023 exclusively on iOS for Times subscribers. New York Times Audio includes exclusive podcasts such as The Headlines, a daily news recap, and Shorts, short audio stories under ten minutes. In addition, a \"Reporter Reads\" section features Times journalists reading their articles and providing commentary.\n\nGames\nThe New York Times has used video games as part of its journalistic efforts, among the first publications to do so, contributing to an increase in Internet traffic; the publication has also developed its own video games. In 2014, The New York Times Magazine introduced Spelling Bee, a word game in which players guess words from a set of letters in a honeycomb and are awarded points for the length of the word and receive extra points if the word is a pangram. The game was proposed by Will Shortz, created by Frank Longo, and has been maintained by Sam Ezersky. In May 2018, Spelling Bee was published on nytimes.com, furthering its popularity. In February 2019, the Times introduced Letter Boxed, in which players form words from letters placed on the edges of a square box, followed in June 2019 by Tiles, a matching game in which players form sequences of tile pairings, and Vertex, in which players connect vertices to assemble an image. In July 2023, The New York Times introduced Connections, in which players identify groups of words that are connected by a common property. In April, the Times introduced Digits, a game that required using operations on different values to reach a set number; Digits was shut down in August. In March 2024, The New York Times released Strands, a themed word search.\nIn January 2022, The New York Times Company acquired Wordle, a word game developed by Josh Wardle in 2021, at a valuation in the \"low-seven figures\". The acquisition was proposed by David Perpich, a member of the Sulzberger family who proposed the purchase to Knight over Slack after reading about the game. The Washington Post purportedly considered acquiring Wordle, according to Vanity Fair. At the 2022 Game Developers Conference, Wardle stated that he was overwhelmed by the volume of Wordle facsimiles and overzealous monetization practices in other games. Concerns over The New York Times monetizing Wordle by implementing a paywall mounted; Wordle is a client-side browser game and can be played offline by downloading its webpage. Wordle moved to the Times's servers and website in February. The game was added to the NYT Games application in August, necessitating it be rewritten in the JavaScript library React. In November, The New York Times announced that Tracy Bennett would be the Wordle's editor.\n\nOther publications\nThe New York Times Magazine\nThe New York Times Magazine and The Boston Globe Magazine are the only weekly Sunday magazines following The Washington Post Magazine's cancellation in December 2022.\n\nThe New York Times International Edition\nThe New York Times in Spanish\nIn February 2016, The New York Times introduced a Spanish website, The New York Times en Espa\u00f1ol. The website, intended to be read on mobile devices, would contain translated articles from the Times and reporting from journalists based in Mexico City. The Times en Espa\u00f1ol's style editor is Paulina Chavira, who has advocated for pluralistic Spanish to accommodate the variety of nationalities in the newsroom's journalists and wrote a stylebook for The New York Times en Espa\u00f1ol Articles the Times intends to publish in Spanish are sent to a translation agency and adapted for Spanish writing conventions; the present progressive tense may be used for forthcoming events in English, but other tenses are preferable in Spanish. The Times en Espa\u00f1ol consults the Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola and Fund\u00e9u and frequently modifies the use of diacritics \u2014 such as using an acute accent for the C\u00e1rtel de Sinaloa but not the Cartel de Medell\u00edn \u2014 and using the gender-neutral pronoun elle. Headlines in The New York Times en Espa\u00f1ol are not capitalized. The Times en Espa\u00f1ol publishes El Times, a newsletter led by Elda Cant\u00fa intended for all Spanish speakers. In September 2019, The New York Times ended The New York Times en Espa\u00f1ol's separate operations. A study published in The Translator in 2023 found that the Times en Espa\u00f1ol engaged in tabloidization.\n\nThe New York Times in Chinese\nIn June 2012, The New York Times introduced a Chinese website, \u7ebd\u7ea6\u65f6\u62a5\u4e2d\u6587, in response to Chinese editions created by The Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times. Conscious to censorship, the Times established servers outside of China and affirmed that the website would uphold the paper's journalistic standards; the government of China had previously blocked articles from nytimes.com through the Great Firewall, and the website was blocked in China until August 2001 after then-general secretary Jiang Zemin met with journalists from The New York Times. Then-foreign editor Joseph Kahn assisted in the establishment of cn.nytimes.com, an effort that contributed to his appointment as executive editor in April 2022. In October, \u7ebd\u7ea6\u65f6\u62a5\u4e2d\u6587 published an article detailing the wealth of then-premier Wen Jiabao's family. In response, the government of China blocked access to nytimes.com and cn.nytimes.com and references to the Times and Wen were censored on microblogging service Sina Weibo. In March 2015, a mirror of \u7ebd\u7ea6\u65f6\u62a5\u4e2d\u6587 and the website for GreatFire were the targets for a government-sanctioned distributed denial of service attack on GitHub in March 2015, disabling access to the service for several days. Chinese authorities requested the removal of The New York Times's news applications from the App Store in December 2016.\n\nAwards and recognition\nAwards\nAs of 2023, The New York Times has received 137 Pulitzer Prizes, the most of any publication.\n\nRecognition\nThe New York Times is considered a newspaper of record in the United States. The Times is the largest metropolitan newspaper in the United States; as of 2022, The New York Times is the second-largest newspaper by print circulation in the United States behind The Wall Street Journal.\nA study published in Science, Technology, & Human Values in 2013 found that The New York Times received more citations in academic journals than the American Sociological Review, Research Policy, or the Harvard Law Review. With sixteen million unique records, the Times is the third-most referenced source in Common Crawl, a collection of online material used in datasets such as GPT-3, behind Wikipedia and a United States patent database.\nThe New Yorker's Max Norman wrote in March 2023 that the Times has shaped mainstream English usage.  In a January 2018 article for The Washington Post, Margaret Sullivan stated that The New York Times affects the \"whole media and political ecosystem\".\nThe New York Times's nascent success has led to concerns over media consolidation, particularly amid the decline of newspapers. In 2006, economists Lisa George and Joel Waldfogel examined the consequences of the Times's national distribution strategy and audience with circulation of local newspapers, finding that local circulation decreased among college-educated readers. The effect of The New York Times in this manner was observed in The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead, the newspaper of record for Fargo, North Dakota. Axios founder Jim VandeHei opined that the Times is \"going to basically be a monopoly\" in an opinion piece written by then-media columnist and former BuzzFeed News editor-in-chief Ben Smith; in the article, Smith cites the strength of The New York Times's journalistic workforce, broadening content, and the expropriation of Gawker editor-in-chief Choire Sicha, Recode editor-in-chief Kara Swisher, and Quartz editor-in-chief Kevin Delaney. Smith compared the Times to the New York Yankees during their 1927 season containing Murderers' Row.\n\nControversies\nIsraeli\u2013Palestinian conflict\nThe New York Times has received criticism for its coverage of the Israel\u2013Hamas war, and the paper has been accused of holding both an anti-Palestinian and an anti-Israeli bias. In April 2024, The Intercept reported that an internal memorandum from November 2023 instructed journalists to reduce using the terms \"genocide\" and \"ethnic cleansing\" and to avoid using the phrase \"occupied territory\" in the context of Palestinian land, Palestine except in rare circumstances, and the term \"refugee camps\" to describe areas of Gaza despite recognition from the United Nations. A spokesperson from the Times stated that issuing guidance was standard practice. An analysis by The Intercept noted that The New York Times described Israeli deaths as a massacre nearly sixty times, but had only described Palestinian deaths as a massacre once.\nIn December 2023, The New York Times published an investigation titled \"'Screams Without Words': How Hamas Weaponized Sexual Violence on Oct. 7\", alleging that Hamas weaponized sexual and gender-based violence during its armed incursion on Israel. The investigation was the subject of an article from The Intercept questioning the journalistic acumen of Anat Schwartz, a filmmaker involved in the inquiry who had no prior reporting experience and agreed with a post stating Israel should \"violate any norm, on the way to victory\", doubting the veracity of the opening claim that Gal Abdush was raped in a timespan disputed by her family, and alleging that the Times was pressured by the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America. The New York Times initiated an inquiry that received criticism from NewsGuild of New York president Susan DeCarava for purported racial targeting; the Times's investigation concluded in ambiguity, but found that journalistic material was handled improperly.\n\nTransgender people\nThe New York Times has received criticism regarding its coverage of transgender people. When it published an opinion piece by Weill Cornell Medicine professor Richard A. Friedman called \"How Changeable Is Gender?\" in August 2015, Vox's German Lopez criticized Friedman as suggesting that parents and doctors might be right in letting children suffer from severe dysphoria in case something changes down the line, and as implying that conversion therapy may work for transgender children. In February 2023, nearly one thousand current and former Times writers and contributors wrote an open letter addressed to standards editor Philip B. Corbett, criticizing the paper's coverage of transgender, non\u2060-\u2060binary, and gender-nonconforming people; some of the Times' articles have been cited in state legislatures attempting to justify criminalizing gender-affirming care. Contributors wrote in the open letter that \"the Times has in recent years treated gender diversity with an eerily familiar mix of pseudoscience and euphemistic, charged language, while publishing reporting on trans children that omits relevant information about its sources.\"\n\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\nWorks cited\nThe New York Times\nThe New York Times Company\nBooks\nReports\nMagazines\nJournals\nPodcasts\nArticles\nFurther reading\nThe New York Times\n\nPodcasts\n\nBooks\n\nArticles\n\nExternal links\n\nOfficial websites\nOfficial website \nTimesMachine\nOfficial Tor site: nytimesn7cgmftshazwhfgzm37qxb44r64ytbb2dj3x62d2lljsciiyd.onion (Accessing link help)\nOthers\nCurated collection of articles before 1923\nWorks by or about The New York Times at the Internet Archive (archives)\nWorks by The New York Times at LibriVox (public domain audiobooks)","213":"The New Yorker is an American magazine featuring journalism, commentary, criticism, essays, fiction, satire, cartoons, and poetry. It was founded on February 21, 1925, by Harold Ross and his wife Jane Grant, a reporter for The New York Times. Together with entrepreneur Raoul H. Fleischmann, they established the F-R Publishing Company and set up the magazine's first office in Manhattan. Ross remained the editor until his death in 1951, shaping the magazine's editorial tone and standards.\nAlthough its reviews and events listings often focused on the cultural life of New York City, The New Yorker gained a reputation for publishing serious fiction, essays, and journalism for a national and international audience, featuring works by notable authors such as Truman Capote, Vladimir Nabokov, and Alice Munro. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, The New Yorker adapted to the digital era, maintaining its traditional print operations while expanding its online presence, including making its archives available on the Internet and introducing a digital version of the magazine. As of 2024, the editor of The New Yorker is David Remnick, who took over in 1998. Since 2004, The New Yorker has published political endorsements in U.S. presidential elections.\nThe New Yorker is published 47 times annually, with five of these issues covering two-week spans. It is well known for its illustrated and often topical covers, such as View of the World from 9th Avenue, its commentaries on popular culture and eccentric American culture, its attention to modern fiction by the inclusion of short stories and literary reviews, its rigorous fact checking and copy editing, its investigative journalism and reporting on politics and social issues, and its single-panel cartoons reproduced throughout each issue.  According to a 2012 Pew Research Center study, The New Yorker, along with The Atlantic and Harper's Magazine, ranked highest in college-educated readership among major American media outlets. It has won eight Pulitzer Prizes since 2014, the first year magazines became eligible for the prize.\n\nOverview and history\nThe New Yorker was founded by Harold Ross (1892\u20131951) and his wife Jane Grant (1892\u20131972), a New York Times reporter, and debuted on February 21, 1925. Ross wanted to create a sophisticated humor magazine that would be different from perceivably \"corny\" humor publications such as Judge, where he had worked, or the old Life. Ross partnered with entrepreneur Raoul H. Fleischmann (who founded the General Baking Company) to establish the F-R Publishing Company. The magazine's first offices were at 25 West 45th Street in Manhattan. Ross edited the magazine until his death in 1951. During the early, occasionally precarious years of its existence, the magazine prided itself on its cosmopolitan sophistication. Ross declared in a 1925 prospectus for the magazine: \"It has announced that it is not edited for the old lady in Dubuque.\"\nAlthough the magazine never lost its touches of humor, it soon established itself as a preeminent forum for serious fiction, essays and journalism. Shortly after the end of World War II, John Hersey's essay Hiroshima filled an entire issue. The magazine has published short stories by many of the most respected writers of the 20th and 21st centuries, including Ann Beattie, Sally Benson, Maeve Brennan, Truman Capote, Rachel Carson, John Cheever, Roald Dahl, Mavis Gallant, Geoffrey Hellman, Ernest Hemingway, Stephen King, Ruth McKenney, John McNulty, Joseph Mitchell, Alice Munro, Haruki Murakami, Vladimir Nabokov, John O'Hara, Dorothy Parker, S.J. Perelman, Philip Roth, George Saunders, J. D. Salinger, Irwin Shaw, James Thurber, John Updike, Eudora Welty, and E. B. White. Publication of Shirley Jackson's \"The Lottery\" drew more mail than any other story in the magazine's history. In its early decades, the magazine sometimes published two or even three short stories in an issue, but in later years the pace has remained steady at one story per issue.\nThe nonfiction feature articles (usually the bulk of an issue) cover an eclectic array of topics. Subjects have included eccentric evangelist Creflo Dollar, the different ways in which humans perceive the passage of time, and M\u00fcnchausen syndrome by proxy.\nThe magazine is known for its editorial traditions. Under the rubric Profiles, it has published articles about prominent people such as Ernest Hemingway, Henry R. Luce and Marlon Brando, Hollywood restaurateur Michael Romanoff, magician Ricky Jay, and mathematicians David and Gregory Chudnovsky. Other enduring features have been \"Goings on About Town\", a listing of cultural and entertainment events in New York, and \"The Talk of the Town\", a feuilleton or miscellany of brief pieces\u2014frequently humorous, whimsical, or eccentric vignettes of life in New York\u2014in a breezily light style, although latterly the section often begins with a serious commentary. For many years, newspaper snippets containing amusing errors, unintended meanings or badly mixed metaphors (\"Block That Metaphor\") have been used as filler items, accompanied by a witty retort. There is no masthead listing the editors and staff. Despite some changes, the magazine has kept much of its traditional appearance over the decades in typography, layout, covers and artwork. The magazine was acquired by Advance Publications, the media company owned by Samuel Irving Newhouse Jr, in 1985, for $200 million when it was earning less than $6 million a year.\nRoss was succeeded as editor by William Shawn (1951\u20131987), followed by Robert Gottlieb (1987\u20131992) and Tina Brown (1992\u20131998). The current editor of The New Yorker is David Remnick, who succeeded Brown in July 1998.\nAmong the important nonfiction authors who began writing for the magazine during Shawn's editorship were Dwight Macdonald, Kenneth Tynan, and Hannah Arendt, whose Eichmann in Jerusalem reportage appeared in the magazine, before it was published as a book.\nBrown's tenure attracted more controversy than Gottlieb's or even Shawn's, thanks to her high profile (Shawn, by contrast, had been an extremely shy, introverted figure), and to the changes she made to a magazine with a similar look for the previous half-century. She introduced color to the editorial pages (several years before The New York Times) and included photography, with less type on each page and a generally more modern layout. More substantively, she increased the coverage of current events and topics such as celebrities and business tycoons, and placed short pieces throughout \"Goings on About Town\", including a racy column about nightlife in Manhattan. A letters-to-the-editor page was introduced, and authors' bylines were added to their \"Talk of the Town\" pieces.\nSince the late 1990s, The New Yorker has used the Internet to publish current and archived material, and maintains a website with some content from the current issue (plus exclusive web-only content). Subscribers have access to the full current issue online and a complete archive of back issues viewable as they were originally printed. In addition, The New Yorker's cartoons are available for purchase online. A digital archive of back issues from 1925 to April 2008 (representing more than 4,000 issues and half a million pages) was also issued on DVD-ROMs and on a small portable hard drive. More recently, an iPad version of the current issue has been released.. In 2014, The New Yorker opened up online access to its archive, expanded its plans to run an ambitious website, and launched a paywalled subscription model. Web editor Nicholas Thompson said, \"What we're trying to do is to make a website that is to the Internet what the magazine is to all other magazines.\"\nThe magazine's editorial staff unionized in 2018 and The New Yorker Union signed its first collective bargaining agreement in 2021.\n\nInfluence and significance\nThe New Yorker influenced a number of similar magazines, including The Brooklynite (1926 to 1930), The Chicagoan (1926 to 1935), and Paris's The Boulevardier (1927 to 1932).\nKurt Vonnegut said that The New Yorker has been an effective instrument for getting a large audience to appreciate modern literature. Tom Wolfe wrote of the magazine: \"The New Yorker style was one of leisurely meandering understatement, droll when in the humorous mode, tautological and litotical when in the serious mode, constantly amplified, qualified, adumbrated upon, nuanced and renuanced, until the magazine's pale-gray pages became High Baroque triumphs of the relative clause and appository modifier\".\nJoseph Rosenblum, reviewing Ben Yagoda's About Town, a history of the magazine from 1925 to 1985, wrote, \"The New Yorker did create its own universe. As one longtime reader wrote to Yagoda, this was a place 'where Peter DeVries ... [sic] was forever lifting a glass of Piesporter, where Niccol\u00f2 Tucci (in a plum velvet dinner jacket) flirted in Italian with Muriel Spark, where Nabokov sipped tawny port from a prismatic goblet (while a Red Admirable perched on his pinky), and where John Updike tripped over the master's Swiss shoes, excusing himself charmingly'\".\n\nCinema\nNew Yorker articles have been regular sources for motion pictures. Both fiction and nonfiction pieces have been adapted for the big screen, including the unreleased Coyote vs. Acme, based on Ian Frazier's article of the same name; Spiderhead (2022), based on George Saunders's story Escape from Spiderhead; Flash of Genius (2008), based on a true account of the invention of the intermittent windshield wiper by John Seabrook; Away from Her, adapted from Alice Munro's short story \"The Bear Came over the Mountain\", which debuted at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival; The Namesake (2007), similarly based on Jhumpa Lahiri's novel, which originated as a short story in the magazine; The Bridge (2006), based on Tad Friend's 2003 nonfiction piece \"Jumpers\"; Brokeback Mountain (2005), an adaptation of the short story by Annie Proulx that appeared in the October 13, 1997, issue; Jonathan Safran Foer's 2001 debut in The New Yorker, which later came to theaters in Liev Schreiber's debut as both screenwriter and director, Everything Is Illuminated (2005); Michael Cunningham's The Hours, which appeared in The New Yorker before becoming the film that garnered the 2002 Best Actress Academy Award for Nicole Kidman; Adaptation (2002), which Charlie Kaufman based on Susan Orlean's The Orchid Thief, written for The New Yorker; Frank McCourt's Angela's Ashes (1999), which also appeared, in part, in The New Yorker before its film adaptation was released in 1999; The Addams Family (1991) and its sequel, Addams Family Values (1993), both inspired by the work of New Yorker cartoonist Charles Addams; Brian De Palma's Casualties of War (1989), which began as a New Yorker article by Daniel Lang; Boys Don't Cry (1999), starring Hilary Swank, which began as an article in the magazine; Iris (2001), about the life of Iris Murdoch and John Bayley, the article written by Bayley for The New Yorker before he completed his full memoir, the film starring Judi Dench and Jim Broadbent; The Swimmer (1968), starring Burt Lancaster, based on a John Cheever short story from The New Yorker; In Cold Blood (1967), the widely nominated adaptation of the 1965 nonfiction serial written for The New Yorker by Truman Capote; Pal Joey (1957), based on a series of stories by John O'Hara; Mister 880 (1950), starring Edmund Gwenn, based on a story by longtime editor St. Clair McKelway; The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (1947), which began as a story by longtime New Yorker contributor James Thurber; and Junior Miss (1941) and Meet Me in St. Louis (1944), both adapted from Sally Benson's short stories.\n\nUnited States presidential election endorsements\nIn its November 1, 2004, issue, the magazine endorsed a presidential candidate for the first time, choosing Democratic nominee John Kerry over incumbent Republican George W. Bush.\n\nCartoons\nThe New Yorker has featured cartoons (usually gag cartoons) since it began publication in 1925. For years, its cartoon editor was Lee Lorenz, who first began cartooning in 1956 and became a New Yorker contract contributor in 1958. After serving as the magazine's art editor from 1973 to 1993 (when he was replaced by Fran\u00e7oise Mouly), he continued in the position of cartoon editor until 1998. His book The Art of the New Yorker: 1925\u20131995 (Knopf, 1995) was the first comprehensive survey of all aspects of the magazine's graphics. In 1998, Robert Mankoff took over as cartoon editor and edited at least 14 collections of New Yorker cartoons. Mankoff also usually contributed a short article to each book, describing some aspect of the cartooning process or the methods used to select cartoons for the magazine. He left the magazine in 2017.\nThe New Yorker's stable of cartoonists has included many important talents in American humor, including Charles Addams, Peter Arno, Charles Barsotti, George Booth, Roz Chast, Tom Cheney, Sam Cobean, Leo Cullum, Richard Decker, Pia Guerra, J. B. Handelsman, Helen E. Hokinson, Pete Holmes, Ed Koren, Reginald Marsh, Mary Petty, George Price, Charles Saxon, Burr Shafer, Otto Soglow, William Steig, Saul Steinberg, James Stevenson, James Thurber, and Gahan Wilson.\nMany early New Yorker cartoonists did not caption their cartoons. In his book The Years with Ross, Thurber describes the newspaper's weekly art meeting, where cartoons submitted over the previous week were brought up from the mail room to be looked over by Ross, the editorial department, and a number of staff writers. Cartoons were often rejected or sent back to artists with requested amendments, while others were accepted and captions were written for them. Some artists hired their own writers; Helen Hokinson hired James Reid Parker in 1931. Brendan Gill relates in his book Here at The New Yorker that at one point in the early 1940s, the quality of the artwork submitted to the magazine seemed to improve. It later was found out that the office boy (a teenaged Truman Capote) had been acting as a volunteer art editor, dropping pieces he did not like down the far end of his desk.\nSeveral of the magazine's cartoons have reached a higher plateau of fame. One 1928 cartoon drawn by Carl Rose and captioned by E. B. White shows a mother telling her daughter, \"It's broccoli, dear.\" The daughter responds, \"I say it's spinach and I say the hell with it.\" The phrase \"I say it's spinach\" entered the vernacular, and three years later, the Broadway musical Face the Music included Irving Berlin's song \"I Say It's Spinach (And the Hell with It)\". The catchphrase \"back to the drawing board\" originated with the 1941 Peter Arno cartoon showing an engineer walking away from a crashed plane, saying, \"Well, back to the old drawing board.\"\nThe most reprinted is Peter Steiner's 1993 drawing of two dogs at a computer, with one saying, \"On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog\". According to Mankoff, Steiner and the magazine have split more than $100,000 in fees paid for the licensing and reprinting of this single cartoon, with more than half going to Steiner.\nOver seven decades, many hardcover compilations of New Yorker cartoons have been published, and in 2004, Mankoff edited The Complete Cartoons of The New Yorker, a 656-page collection with 2,004 of the magazine's best cartoons published during 80 years, plus a double CD set with all 68,647 cartoons ever published in the magazine. This features a search function allowing readers to search for cartoons by cartoonist's name or year of publication. The newer group of cartoonists in recent years includes Pat Byrnes, J. C. Duffy, Liana Finck, Emily Flake, Robert Leighton, Michael Maslin, Julia Suits, and P. C. Vey. Will McPhail cited his beginnings as \"just ripping off Calvin and Hobbes, Bill Watterson, and doing little dot eyes.\" The notion that some New Yorker cartoons have punchlines so oblique as to be impenetrable became a subplot in the Seinfeld episode \"The Cartoon\", as well as a playful jab in The Simpsons episode \"The Sweetest Apu\".\nIn April 2005, the magazine began using the last page of each issue for \"The New Yorker Cartoon Caption Contest\". Captionless cartoons by The New Yorker's regular cartoonists are printed each week. Captions are submitted by readers, and three are chosen as finalists. Readers then vote on the winner. Anyone age 13 or older can enter or vote. Each contest winner receives a print of the cartoon (with the winning caption) signed by the artist who drew the cartoon. In 2017, after Bob Mankoff left the magazine, Emma Allen became the youngest and first female cartoon editor in the magazine's history.\n\nComics journalism\nSince 1993, the magazine has published occasional stories of comics journalism (alternately called \"sketchbook reports\") by such cartoonists as Marisa Acocella Marchetto, Barry Blitt, Sue Coe, Robert Crumb and Aline Kominsky-Crumb, Jules Feiffer, Ben Katchor, Carol Lay, Gary Panter, Art Spiegelman, Mark Alan Stamaty, and Ronald Wimberly.\n\nCrosswords and puzzles\nIn April 2018, The New Yorker launched a crossword puzzle series with a weekday crossword published every Monday. Subsequently, it launched a second, weekend crossword that appears on Fridays and relaunched cryptic puzzles that were run in the magazine in the late 1990s. In June 2021, it began publishing new cryptics weekly. In July 2021, The New Yorker introduced Name Drop, a trivia game, which is posted online weekdays. In March 2022, The New Yorker moved to publishing online crosswords every weekday, with decreasing difficulty Monday through Thursday and themed puzzles on Fridays. The puzzles are written by a rotating stable of 13 constructors. They integrate cartoons into the solving experience. The Christmas 2019 issue featured a crossword puzzle by Patrick Berry that had cartoons as clues, with the answers being captions for the cartoons. In December 2019, Liz Maynes-Aminzade was named The New Yorker's first puzzles and games editor.\n\nEustace Tilley\nThe magazine's first cover illustration, a dandy peering at a butterfly through a monocle, was drawn by Rea Irvin, the magazine's first art editor, based on an 1834 caricature of the then Count d'Orsay that appeared as an illustration in the 11th edition of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. The gentleman on the original cover, now known as Eustace Tilley, is a character created for The New Yorker by Corey Ford. The hero of a series titled \"The Making of a Magazine\", which began on the inside front cover of the August 8 issue that first summer, Tilley was a younger man than the figure on the original cover. His top hat was of a newer style, without the curved brim. He wore a morning coat and striped formal trousers. Ford borrowed Eustace Tilley's last name from an aunt\u2014he had always found it vaguely humorous. \"Eustace\" was selected by Ford for euphony.\nThe character has become a kind of mascot for The New Yorker, frequently appearing in its pages and on promotional materials. Traditionally, Irvin's original Tilley cover illustration is used every year on the issue closest to the anniversary date of February 21, though on several occasions a newly drawn variation has been substituted.\n\nCovers\nThe magazine is known for its illustrated and often topical covers.\n\n\"View of the World\" cover\nSaul Steinberg created 85 covers and 642 internal drawings and illustrations for the magazine. His most famous work is probably its March 29, 1976, cover, an illustration most often called \"View of the World from 9th Avenue\" and sometimes called \"A Parochial New Yorker's View of the World\" or \"A New Yorker's View of the World\", which depicts a map of the world as seen by self-absorbed New Yorkers.\nThe illustration is split in two, with the bottom half of the image showing Manhattan's 9th Avenue, 10th Avenue, and the Hudson River (appropriately labeled), and the top half depicting the rest of the world. The rest of the United States is the size of the three New York City blocks and is drawn as a square, with a thin brown strip along the Hudson representing \"Jersey\", the names of five cities (Los Angeles; Washington, D.C.; Las Vegas; Kansas City; and Chicago) and three states (Texas, Utah, and Nebraska) scattered among a few rocks for the U.S. beyond New Jersey. The Pacific Ocean, perhaps half again as wide as the Hudson, separates the U.S. from three flattened land masses labeled China, Japan and Russia.\nThe illustration\u2014humorously depicting New Yorkers' self-image of their place in the world, or perhaps outsiders' view of New Yorkers' self-image\u2014inspired many similar works, including the poster for the 1984 film Moscow on the Hudson; that movie poster led to a lawsuit, Steinberg v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., 663 F. Supp. 706 (S.D.N.Y. 1987), which held that Columbia Pictures violated the copyright that Steinberg held on his work.\nThe cover was later satirized by Barry Blitt for the cover of The New Yorker on October 6, 2008. The cover featured Sarah Palin looking out of her window seeing only Alaska, with Russia in the far background.\nThe March 21, 2009, cover of The Economist, \"How China sees the World\", is also an homage to the original image, depicting the viewpoint from Beijing's Chang'an Avenue instead of Manhattan.\n\n9\/11\nHired by Tina Brown in 1992, Art Spiegelman worked for The New Yorker for ten years but resigned a few months after the September 11 terrorist attacks. The cover created by Spiegelman and Fran\u00e7oise Mouly for the September 24, 2001, issue of The New Yorker received wide acclaim and was voted as being among the top ten magazine covers of the past 40 years by the American Society of Magazine Editors, which commented:\n\nNew Yorker Covers Editor Fran\u00e7oise Mouly repositioned Art Spiegelman's silhouettes, inspired by Ad Reinhardt's black-on-black paintings, so that the North Tower's antenna breaks the \"W\" of the magazine's logo. Spiegelman wanted to see the emptiness, and find the awful\/awe-filled image of all that disappeared on 9\/11. The silhouetted Twin Towers were printed in a fifth, black ink, on a field of black made up of the standard four color printing inks. An overprinted clear varnish helps create the ghost images that linger, insisting on their presence through the blackness.\nAt first glance, the cover appears to be totally black, but upon close examination it reveals the silhouettes of the World Trade Center towers in a slightly darker shade of black. In some situations, the ghost images become visible only when the magazine is tilted toward a light source. In September 2004, Spiegelman reprised the image on the cover of his book In the Shadow of No Towers, in which he relates his experience of the Twin Towers attack and its psychological aftereffects.\n\n\"New Yorkistan\"\nIn the December 2001 issue, the magazine printed a cover by Maira Kalman and Rick Meyerowitz showing a map of New York in which various neighborhoods were labeled with humorous names reminiscent of Middle Eastern and Central Asian place names and referencing the neighborhood's real name or characteristics (e.g., \"Fuhgeddabouditstan\", \"Botoxia\"). The cover had some cultural resonance in the wake of September 11, and became a popular print and poster.\n\nControversial covers\nCrown Heights in 1993\nFor the 1993 Valentine's Day issue, the magazine cover by Art Spiegelman depicted a black woman and a Hasidic Jewish man kissing, referencing the Crown Heights riot of 1991. The cover was criticized by both black and Jewish observers. Jack Salzman and Cornel West called the reaction to the cover the magazine's \"first national controversy\".\n\n2008 Obama cover satire and controversy\n\"The Politics of Fear\", a cartoon by Barry Blitt featured on the cover of the July 21, 2008, issue, depicts then presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama in the turban and shalwar kameez typical of many Muslims, fist bumping with his wife, Michelle, portrayed with an Afro and wearing camouflage trousers with an assault rifle slung over her back. They are standing in the Oval Office, with a portrait of Osama bin Laden hanging on the wall and an American flag burning in the fireplace in the background.\nMany New Yorker readers saw the image as a lampoon of \"The Politics of Fear\", as was its title. Some Obama supporters, as well as his presumptive Republican opponent, John McCain, accused the magazine of publishing an incendiary cartoon whose irony could be lost on some readers. Editor David Remnick felt the image's obvious excesses rebuffed the concern that it could be misunderstood, even by those unfamiliar with the magazine. \"The intent of the cover\", he said, \"is to satirize the vicious and racist attacks and rumors and misconceptions about the Obamas that have been floating around in the blogosphere and are reflected in public opinion polls. What we set out to do was to throw all these images together, which are all over the top and to shine a kind of harsh light on them, to satirize them.\"\nIn an interview on Larry King Live shortly after the magazine issue began circulating, Obama said, \"Well, I know it was The New Yorker's attempt at satire... I don't think they were entirely successful with it\". Obama also pointed to his own efforts to debunk the allegations the cover depicted through a website his campaign set up, saying that the allegations were \"actually an insult against Muslim-Americans\".\nLater that week, The Daily Show's Jon Stewart continued The New Yorker cover's argument about Obama stereotypes with a piece showcasing a montage of clips containing such stereotypes culled from various legitimate news sources. Stewart and Stephen Colbert parodied The New Yorker's Obama cover on the October 3, 2008, cover of Entertainment Weekly magazine, with Stewart as Barack and Colbert as Michelle, photographed for the magazine in New York City on September 18.\nNew Yorker covers are sometimes unrelated to the contents of the magazine or only tangentially related. The article about Obama in the July 21, 2008, issue did not discuss the attacks and rumors but rather Obama's political career. The magazine later endorsed Obama for president.\nThis parody was most likely inspired by Fox News host E. D. Hill's paraphrasing of an anonymous internet comment in asking whether a gesture made by Obama and his wife Michelle was a \"terrorist fist jab\". Later, Hill's contract was not renewed.\n\n2013 Bert and Ernie cover\nThe New Yorker chose an image of Bert and Ernie by artist Jack Hunter, titled \"Moment of Joy\", as the cover of the July 8, 2013, issue, which covered the Supreme Court decisions on the Defense of Marriage Act and California Proposition 8. The Sesame Street characters have long been rumored in urban legend to be homosexual partners, though Sesame Workshop has repeatedly denied this, saying they are merely \"puppets\" and have no sexual orientation. Reaction was mixed. Online magazine Slate criticized the cover, which shows Ernie leaning on Bert's shoulder as they watch a television with the Supreme Court justices on the screen, saying, \"it's a terrible way to commemorate a major civil-rights victory for gay and lesbian couples.\" The Huffington Post, meanwhile, said it was \"one of [the magazine's] most awesome covers of all time\".\n\n2023 \"Race for Office\" cover\nThe cover of the October 2, 2023 issue, titled \"The Race for Office\", depicts several top U.S. politicians\u2014Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell, Nancy Pelosi, and Joe Biden\u2014running the titular race for office with walkers. Many have questioned the mental and physical states of these and other older politicians, particularly those who have decided to run for reelection. While many acknowledged the cover as satirizing this issue, others criticized the \"ableism and ageism\" of mocking older people and people who use walkers. The New Yorker said the cover \"portrays the irony and absurdity of the advanced-age politicians currently vying for our top offices.\"\n\nStyle\nThe New Yorker's signature display typeface, used for its nameplate and headlines and the masthead above The Talk of the Town section, is Irvin, named after its creator, the designer-illustrator Rea Irvin. The body text of all articles in The New Yorker is set in Adobe Caslon.\nOne uncommonly formal feature of the magazine's in-house style is the placement of diaeresis marks in words with repeating vowels\u2014such as re\u00eblected, pre\u00ebminent, and co\u00f6perate\u2014in which the two vowel letters indicate separate vowel sounds. The magazine also continues to use a few spellings that are otherwise little used in American English, such as fuelled, focussed, venders, teen-ager, traveller, marvellous, carrousel, and cannister.\nThe magazine also spells out the names of numerical amounts, such as \"two million three hundred thousand dollars\" instead of \"$2.3 million\", even for very large figures.\n\nFact-checking\nIn 1927, The New Yorker ran an article about Edna St. Vincent Millay that contained multiple factual errors, and her mother threatened to sue the publication for libel. Consequently, the magazine developed extensive fact-checking procedures, which became integral to its reputation as early as the 1940s. In 2019, the Columbia Journalism Review said that \"no publication has been more consistently identified with its rigorous fact-checking\". As of 2010, it employs 16 fact-checkers.\nAt least two defamation lawsuits have been filed over articles published in the magazine, though neither were won by the plaintiff. Two 1983 articles by Janet Malcolm about Sigmund Freud's legacy led to a lawsuit from writer Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson, who claimed that Malcolm had fabricated quotes attributed to him. After years of proceedings and appeals, a jury found in Malcolm's favor in 1994. In 2010, David Grann wrote an article for the magazine about art expert Peter Paul Biro that scrutinized and expressed skepticism about Biro's stated methods to identify forgeries. Biro sued The New Yorker for defamation, alongside multiple other news outlets that reported on the article, but the case was summarily dismissed.\n\nReadership\nDespite its title, The New Yorker is read nationwide, with 53 percent of its circulation in the top 10 U.S. metropolitan areas. According to Mediamark Research Inc., the average age of The New Yorker readers in 2009 was 47 (compared to 43 in 1980 and 46 in 1990). The average household income of The New Yorker readers in 2009 was $109,877 (the average income in 1980 was $62,788 and the average income in 1990 was $70,233).\nPolitically, the magazine's readership holds generally liberal views. According to a 2014 Pew Research Center survey, 77% of The New Yorker's readers have left-of-center political values, and 52% of them hold \"consistently liberal\" political values.\n\nList of books about The New Yorker\nFilms about The New Yorker\nIn Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle, a film about the Algonquin Round Table starring Jennifer Jason Leigh as Dorothy Parker, Sam Robards portrays founding editor Harold Ross trying to drum up support for his fledgling publication.\nThe magazine's former editor, William Shawn, is portrayed in Capote (2005), Infamous (2006), and Hannah Arendt (2012).\nThe 2015 documentary Very Semi-Serious, directed by Leah Wolchok and produced by Wolchok and Davina Pardo (Redora Films), presents a behind-the-scenes look at the cartoons of The New Yorker.\n\nList of films about The New Yorker\nMrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle (Fine Line Features, 1994, 126 minutes)\nJames Thurber: The Life and Hard Times (First Run Features, 2000, 57 minutes)\nJoe Gould's Secret (USA Films, 2000, 104 minutes)\nTop Hat and Tales: Harold Ross and the Making of the New Yorker (Carousel Film and Video, 2001, 47 minutes)\nVery Semi-Serious (Redora Films, 2015, 83 minutes)\nWes Anderson's The French Dispatch (Indian Paintbrush, 2021, 108 minutes) is an overt homage to the magazine; the film consists of several long-form \"stories\", all in the style of various New Yorker contributors.\n\nSee also\nList of The New Yorker contributors\nThe New Yorker Festival\nThe New Yorker Radio Hour, a radio program carried by public radio stations\n\nExplanatory notes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website \nA Guided Tour Through The New Yorker\nBoxer, Sarah. \"A Gaggle of Cartoonists\", The New York Times, February 14, 2000.\n\"How to Submit Cartoons to The New Yorker\" (archived 3 November 2013)\nNew Yorker 1950\u20131955 album on Internet Archive\nNew Yorker Fiction Database 1925\u20132013","214":"Profound Desires of the Gods  or Deep Desires of Gods or Kuragejima \u2013 Legends from a Southern Island (\u795e\u3005\u306e\u6df1\u304d\u6b32\u671b, Kamigami no Fukaki Yokub\u014d) is a 1968 Japanese film by director Shohei Imamura. The culmination of the director's examinations of the fringes of Japanese society throughout the 1960s, the film was an 18-month super-production which failed to make an impression at the time of its release, but has since risen in stature.\n\nPlot\nPresenting a vast chronicle of life on the remote Kurage Island, the film centres on the disgraced, superstitious, interbred Futori family and the Tokyo engineer sent to supervise the creation of a new well for a sugar mill on the island \u2013 an encounter which leads to both conflict and complicity in strange and powerful ways.\n\nCast\nKazuo Kitamura as Engineer Kariya, a modern-day married man from Tokyo who gets entangled in the Futori family.

He comes into contact with the patient who contaminated him, in the process seeing the consequences of ignoring the disease. Treating himself in secret with Salvarsan and tormented by his sense of injustice for not being able to help the man, he rejects Misao, his fianc\u00e9 of six years, without explanation, as he does not wish her to have to wait for a number of years until he is cured.

It was Japan's first feature length film to fully employ sound, as well the earliest surviving Japanese sound film.\n\nPlot\nThe comedic story depicts a playwright attempting to write a play by a strict deadline and getting distracted by his family and a noisy next-door jazz band.\nThe film opens with Shibano, a playwright for a Tokyo theater, squabbling with a painter over his work depicting a local house, newly up for rent. The two stumble into the street only to be interrupted when Shibano accidentally falls into the women's section of a nearby bathhouse. The woman who appears to scold them ends up dissolving the situation, and Shibano finally states his desire to move into the house pictured previously.\nSoon, Shibano and his family have moved in, but he is late on his deadline for a new script and the family is running low on money. His first attempts do not go well, with distractions from his children and his wife, as well as his own procrastination. The neighbors are also distracting, as they host the rehearsals of a jazz band. When Shibano goes next door to ask them to quiet down, he is invited by the wife of the household to stay and watch the rehearsal. She turns out to be the same woman who previously intervened in Shibano's fight in Tokyo. As the group practices and treats Shibano to drink, he listens to the song lyrics and becomes infected with the new jazz fever of the period. The song about the \"Age of Speed\" inspires him to go home and finish his script. The movie ends with a more modernized family reflecting on their differences from the local farmers.\n\nCast\nAtsushi Watanabe as Shinsaku Shibano, the playwright\nKinuyo Tanaka as Shibano's wife\nSatoko Date as Takiko Yamakawa, the neighbor's wife\nMitsuko Ichimura as the playwright's daughter\nShinichi Himori\nYukiko Inoue\nTokuji Kobayashi\nTakeshi Sakamoto\n\nAwards\n1931 Kinema Junpo Award for Best Film\n\nLegacy\nThe Neighbor's Wife and Mine was screened at the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive in 1990 and at the Museum of Modern Art in 2015 as part of its retrospective on early Japanese sound films.

Set in mid-19th century Japan, a few years before the Meiji Restoration, it follows the life of Seibei Iguchi, a low-ranking samurai employed as a bureaucrat. Poor, but not destitute, he still manages to lead a content and happy life with his daughters and his mother, who has dementia. Through an unfortunate turn of events, the turbulent times conspire against him.\nThe film was inspired by the short story \"The Bamboo Sword\" by Shuhei Fujisawa. The Twilight Samurai won an unprecedented 12 Japanese Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Screenplay. The Twilight Samurai was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 76th Academy Awards.\n\nPlot\nAt the start of the film, the main character, Iguchi Seibei, becomes a widower when his wife succumbs to tuberculosis. His wife receives a grand funeral, more than Seibei, a low-ranking samurai, can afford. Seibei works in the grain warehouse, keeping inventory for the clan. His samurai colleagues mock him behind his back with the nickname Tasogare (Twilight): when evening approaches, Seibei rushes home to look after his elderly mother, who has dementia, and two young daughters, Kayano and Ito, instead of bonding with his supervisor and other samurai colleagues over customary nights of dinner, geisha entertainment, and sake drinking. Even though he is a samurai, Seibei neglects his appearance, failing to bathe or shave his head, and being shabbily dressed. The well-being of his young daughters and medicine for his mother take priority over new clothes or the monthly bath fee, and his daughters say they are both happy, even without a mother.\nThings change when Seibei's childhood friend Tomoe (sister of Iinuma Michinojo, one of his better, kinder samurai friends and much higher ranked in the clan) returns to town. Tomoe is atypical in that she was a tom-boy as a child and as an adult questions points of etiquette, such as obeying her elder brother's wife and not attending peasant festivals. Recently divorced from an abusive alcoholic husband (Koda, a samurai captain), Tomoe finds comfort and solace with Seibei's daughters. Tomoe's ex-husband Koda barges into the household of Michinojo in the middle of night in a drunken demand for Tomoe and challenges Michinojo to a duel which Seibei, believing Michinojo could not win, accepts on Michinojo's behalf, although Seibei knows his clan forbids duels and the penalty is usually death for the winner as the loser is already dead. Michinojo arrives before Seibei and is facing Koda. Seibei interrupts and decides to use only a wooden stick whilst Koda brandishes a steel katana. Koda, after being disarmed and asked if that can be the end of it, picks up his sword so Seibei knocks him unconscious, sparing both their lives. A few days later, Captain of the Guard Yogo passes by Seibei while Seibei is working in the stores and quietly announces he is friends with Koda who has asked him for help in seeking vengeance on Seibei. Recognising that Seibei has some skill and learning that Seibei has learnt a particular style of fighting, Yogo hopes they can duel someday. Seibei's workmates learn of the duel and wonder if they should stop calling him by his nickname.\nWhen Iinuma Michinojo asks Seibei to marry his sister, saying she has turned down many offers and he will not force her, Seibei feels that Iinuma is teasing him for his strong feelings for Tomoe, like when he, Iinuma, and Tomoe were children. Iinuma knows Tomoe's feeling for Seibei, and Seibei is a kind man who would treat Tomoe better than Koda. With much deep regret, Seibei declines Iinuma's offer of his sister's hand in marriage, citing his inferior social status and how he did not want to see Tomoe share the burden of poverty despite Michinojo's protest that Tomoe is a grown woman who knows what she is in for. Seibei stoically regrets how his departed wife suffered in his care who, like Tomoe, came from a wealthier family. Iinuma talks no more of it. Tomoe stops visiting Kayano and Ito.\nIn the final act, the ranking official of Seibei's clan, having heard of his prowess with a sword, orders Seibei to kill Yogo, who has been \"disowned\" and who stubbornly refuses to resign his post by committing seppuku. The young lord of the clan had died from measles and there was a succession struggle behind the scenes over who will be the new lord. Yogo ended up on the losing side of this conflict, hence his ordered suicide. Yogo has already killed a formidable samurai that was sent to kill him. Seibei is promised a rise in rank and pay if he accepts the dangerous mission.\nSeibei is very reluctant to fight Yogo at first, requesting one month to prepare for it. He says that, because of great hardship in his life, he has lost all resolve to fight with ferocity and disregard for his own life, because of the experience of watching his two girls grow. As they continue to insist, he requests two days to get himself up to the task. The new clan leader is furious over this answer and orders him expelled from the clan. Seibei is finally forced to agree to attempt the mission. Upon parting that evening, Seibei's supervisor (who was present during the meeting) promises him that he will make sure the girls will be taken care of if the worst comes to pass.\nThe following morning, Seibei attempts to get ready, but there is no one to help him with the rituals of samurai before battle. With no one to turn to, he asks Tomoe for her assistance. Before he leaves, he tells Tomoe that he was wrong to decline the offer of marriage. He says that if he lives, he would like to ask for her hand in marriage now that there is promise of a promotion. She regretfully tells Seibei she has accepted another proposal. Seibei, feeling like a fool, tells Tomoe to forget about the silly conversation. Tomoe says that she will not be waiting at his household for him to return but that she hopes from her heart that he will return safely. Seibei says he understands completely. He thanks Tomoe for her generosity for assisting him in this final ritual.\nAt Yogo's house, Seibei finds his target drinking alcohol in a dark, fly-infested room. Yogo recognizes Seibei and invites him to sit and drink. He then asks Seibei to allow him to run away. He explains he was only faithfully serving his master and describes how his wife and daughter also died of tuberculosis due to hardship and spending seven years as a r\u014dnin. Only thanks to his master's generosity could he afford a proper funeral. Yogo tells Seibei that he expects Seibei was promised a reward for this errand and that he too performed errands for his superior, taking the word of his superior as the word of the clan. Seibei commiserates and reveals further parallels in the two men's stories, such as that his wife's family demanded she have an expensive funeral and so he sold his katana to pay for it. He reveals that his long scabbard contains a fake bamboo sword. This angers Yogo who believes Seibei is mocking him: the short kodachi can be carried even by common people who are not samurai. Seibei explains he has been trained with the short sword, which he still carries, but Yogo is not placated.\nSeibei's kodachi fighting style is matched up against Yogo's itt\u014d-ry\u016b (single long sword) swordsmanship in an intense close quarters duel. Despite allowing Yogo to slash him several times and offering him chances to flee, Yogo presses the attack and Seibei kills Yogo when his longer sword gets caught in the rafters. Despite his wounds, Seibei limps home. Kayano and Ito rush to him in the courtyard, happy to see him. Tomoe is still there, waiting in the house. They have an emotional reunion.\nIn a brief epilogue set many years later, Seibei's younger daughter, Ito, now elderly, visits the grave of Seibei and Tomoe. Narrating, she explains they married but that their happiness was not to last: He died three years later in the Boshin War, Japan's last civil war. Tomoe took care of Seibei's daughters until they were both married. Ito often heard that Tasogare Seibei was a very unfortunate character, a most pathetic samurai with no luck at all. Ito disagrees: Her father never had any ambition to become anything special; he loved his two daughters, and was loved by the beautiful Tomoe.\n\nCast\nHiroyuki Sanada as Seibei Iguchi\nRie Miyazawa as Tomoe Iinuma\nNenji Kobayashi as Choubei Kusaka\nRen Osugi as Toyotarou Kouda\nMitsuru Fukikoshi as Michinojo Iinuma\nHiroshi Kanbe as Naota\nMiki It\u014d as Kayano Iguchi\nErina Hashiguchi as Ito Iguchi\nReiko Kusamura as Iguchi's Mother\nMin Tanaka as Zenemon Yogo\nKeiko Kishi as Ito, as an old woman\nTetsuro Tamba as Tozaemon Iguchi\n\nReception\nBox office\nIn Japan, the film grossed \u00a51.2 billion ($9.57 million) in 2002, becoming the year's 16th top-grossing film at the Japanese box office.

Yusaku, staying in the next room, hears the turmoil and gives a shout to Kinya.\nThe three people continue to travel even though they are very tired. The next day, near Rikubetsu Station Yusaku was not chatty while eating crab in a small dining room near where Kinya was born. After that, instead of Kinya, who ran into the toilet with a car on the street while feeling abdominal pain while driving, Akumi said, \"I went to provisional exemption\" to pass the tractor of the oncoming car, but the car swerved. In the chaos he dashed out of the car through the farmland and forced a car into a bales of hay, causing Kinya and Akemi to argue, and Akimi began to cry. Negotiating with Yusaku, he will stay at the farmhouse. Then Yusaku discussed with Kinya with respect to non-principled attitude against Akemi of Kinya. From the conversation in the car, it becomes clear that Yusaku is heading to Yubari, where he once lived.\nAt the parking lot in Obihiro, Kinya kicks a Lincoln Continental thinking it is unattended. As a result, he is struck by a yakuza-style man who was riding but escaped from difficulties after Yusaku's counterattack. However, as Yusaku drove the car as it was, the story unfolded. Their car was caught in a simultaneous inspection of a robbery, and it turned out that Yusaku was unlicensed. When asked why he was unlicensed, he said he had been in prison for murder for the past six years until the day before yesterday. He will be taken to the nearest Shintoku police station, where the chief who presided over Yusaku's case, Watanabe Kiyoshi, is on duty by chance, and his warm feelings make him happy. Yusaku, back from the police station, says he will continue traveling via train, but in the end, the three-person journey continues.\nYusaku gradually talks about his past in the car and in the room of the inn. He mentions meeting his wife, Mitsue, who was a cashier at the supermarket, their wedding, and their happy honeymoon. After that, Yusaku was pleased that Mitsue seems to have become pregnant. He grew up without knowing his parents because his father died in the war. He said he wanted to tell Mitsue that she would go to the doctor soon, and bravely went to work when Mitsue said, \"If you are pregnant, fly the yellow handkerchief on a stick.\" Yusaku, who found one yellow handkerchief fluttering on the way home from work, felt as if he was rising to heaven. However, a few days later, even though he said, \"Do not overdo it,\" Mitsue, who worked hard, miscarried. Yusaku learns about Mitsue's past at the hospital. It was a miscarriage five years before. \"I hate the woman who hides secretly,\" he said, because he was angry and was sick of the sake. Even though Mitsue said she did not know about the previous miscarriage, the desperate Yusaku became disillusioned, went out to the downtown at night, and started a quarrel with Chimpira. In the fight, a man is killed.\nYusaku, arrested and in prison, decides to divorce. Yusaku instructed Mitsue who visited us, saying, \"Now you are still young, and if you feel like that, you may be a good man, be happy.\" \"You were a selfish person, even when I met you,\" Mitsue cried, but this was a love expression for a man of his style, who could only live a clumsy way of life.\" After a while, a divorce notice was sent to prison. I blame him, \"I wonder what I can do at that time.\" \"Why did you become a yakuza like this?\" \"I will say goodbye to Sapporo tomorrow.\" \"If I didn't work, I might go to Tokyo.\" Kinya weeps.\nA wandering theater troup (Unified Theater) is singing \"Ginza Kankan Musume\" in the small square, but Yusaku is deeply moved by watching the carp streamer fluttering in the sky. Yusaku is said to head to Yubari alone. When asked why he confessed that he had posted a postcard to Mitsue in Abashiri just after his release. The postcard said, \"If you're still alone and waiting for me... hang a yellow handkerchief on the streamer of the carp. That's a sign. If it's not down, I just turn back. I will never appear again in Yubari.\" Upon hearing that, Kinya and Akemi decide to go to Yubari together without hesitation.\n\"I'll turn back,\" \"I can't think he's alone,\" \"I'm with someone,\" and the feelings of a shaking man and the two people encourage it. Yusaku, who is timid, \"he shouldn't be waiting for me,\" asks him to turn back and does so once. In response to the persuasion, he went back to Yubari again. The car enters the town of Yubari. Akemi explains the scenery one by one to Yusaku, who can no longer look outside, and Yusaku answers. Yusaku explains the way to the voice of \"I crossed the railroad crossing\". You can hear the children's songs about \"backspin.\" Kinya considers the unlikely event that he may have moved. Eventually, the car stopped and Kinya and Akemi went out and looked around.\nWithout finding it, Kinya said, \"I'm in front of the bathhouse right now,\" but there was something in his line of sight. When Akemi calls Kinya, he shouts, \"Huh, that!\" Dozens of yellow handkerchiefs fluttered in the wind in front of the line of sight. Yusaku is shoved in the crowd. No words were needed for the reunion of the two. They stare at each other and disappear into the house in a friendly way.\nKinya and Akemi who saw the event naturally hold hands in the car, hug each other strongly, and kiss. A yellow handkerchief of happiness hangs on a koinobori pole against the backdrop of the city of Yubari.\n\nCast\nKen Takakura: Yusaku Shima\nChieko Baisho: Mitsue Shima\nTetsuya Takeda: Kinya Hanada\nKaori Momoi: Akemi Ogawa\nHachir\u014d Tako\nHisao Dazai: Ryokan Manager\nMari Okamoto: Ramen Shop Girl\nKiyoshi Atsumi: Watanabe Kach\u014d\n\nAdaptations\nYathra (1985)\nThe Yellow Handkerchief (2008)\n\nBibliography\nShiawase no kiiroi hankachi (1977) at IMDb\n\u5e78\u798f\u306e\u9ec4\u8272\u3044\u30cf\u30f3\u30ab\u30c1 (in Japanese).

In 1979, he directed his second film, the black comedy The Man Who Stole the Sun, which won him the Best Director award at the 1979 Yokohama Film Festival.

It was produced to illustrate the purpose of the workers' union at the Toho film studios, as the Allied Forces endorsed the formation of unions as part of the democratisation process during the post-World War II Occupation of Japan.

When the workers at a railway company, including the family's subtenant Seizo, go on strike, Chieko and her co-workers demonstrate their solidarity and call for strike as well to achieve financial security for the film studio's staff.

The film transposes the plot of English dramatist William Shakespeare's play Macbeth (1606) from Medieval Scotland to feudal Japan, with stylistic elements drawn from Noh drama. The film stars Toshiro Mifune and Isuzu Yamada in the lead roles, modelled on the characters Macbeth and Lady Macbeth.\nAs with the play, the film tells the story of a warrior who assassinates his sovereign at the urging of his ambitious wife. Kurosawa was a fan of the play and intended to make his own adaptation for several years, delaying it after learning of Orson Welles' Macbeth (1948). Among his changes was the ending, which required archers to shoot arrows around Mifune. The film was shot around Mount Fuji and Izu Peninsula. With a budget of US$350,000 (equivalent to $3,797,000 in 2023), the film was one of the most expensive films ever made in Japan at the time of its release.\nDespite the change in setting and language and numerous creative liberties, Throne of Blood is often considered one of the best film adaptations of the classic play, and has received much critical praise. The film won two Mainichi Film Awards, including Best Actor for Toshiro Mifune.\n\nPlot\nGenerals Miki and Washizu are samurai commanders and friends under Tsuzuki, a local lord who reigns in the castle of the Spider's Web Forest. After defeating the lord's enemies in battle, they return to his castle. On their way through the thick forest, they meet an evil spirit, who foretells their future, telling them that Washizu will be named Lord of the Northern Garrison and Miki will become commander of the first fortress that day. The spirit then foretells that Washizu eventually will become Lord of Spider's Web Castle, and finally, Miki's son will become lord. When the two return to Tsuzuki's estate, he rewards them with exactly what the spirit had predicted. As Washizu discusses this with his wife Asaji, she manipulates him into causing the second part of the prophecy to come true by murdering Tsuzuki when he visits.\nAsaji gives drugged sake to Tsuzuki's guards, causing them to fall asleep and allowing Washizu to enter Tsuzuki's bedchamber and kill him in his sleep. When Washizu returns in shock at his deed, Asaji grabs the bloody spear and puts it in the hands of an unconscious guard, then cries out that an intruder has entered the castle; Washizu slays the guard before he has a chance to plead his innocence. Kunimaru, Tsuzuki's vengeful son, and Noriyasu, one of Tsuzuki's advisors,  both suspect Washizu's treachery and try to warn Miki, who refuses to believe what they are saying about his friend. Under Asaji's influence, Washizu is unsure of Miki's loyalty but chooses Miki's son as his heir because he and Asaji have no child of their own. Washizu plans to tell Miki and his son about his decision at a grand banquet. However, Asaji tells him that she is pregnant, which leaves him with a quandary concerning his heir: now, Miki and his son have to be eliminated.\nDuring the banquet, Washizu is agitated because Miki and his son have not arrived and drinks sake copiously. He loses his self-control when Miki's ghost suddenly appears. In a delusional panic, he reveals what has happened to Miki by exclaiming that he is willing to slay Miki a second time, unsheathing his sword and slashing at the empty air near Miki's seat. Attempting to cover for him, Asaji tells the guests that he is drunk and has everyone retire for the evening. One of Washizu's men arrives carrying a bundle containing the severed head of Miki, and tells Washizu and Asaji that Miki's son escaped. Washizu kills the man.\nLater, Washizu's men are beginning to doubt and fear him, and rumors circulate that Miki's son Yoshiteru, Kunimaru, and Noriyasu have joined forces with their onetime rival Inui. Washizu is distraught by the news that his heir has been born dead. In order to ascertain the outcome of the impending battle with his foes, he returns to the forest in search of the evil spirit. The spirit tells him that he will not be defeated in battle until \"the trees of the Spider's Web Forest rise against the castle\". Washizu believes this is impossible and becomes confident of his victory. Washizu tells his troops of the prophecy, and they share his confidence. The next morning, Washizu is awakened by the screams of Asaji's attendants. In her quarters, he finds Asaji in a semi-catatonic state, trying to wash clean an imaginary stain and stench of blood from her hands. Distracted by the sound of his troops, Washizu leaves to investigate. Washizu is told by a panicked soldier that the trees of Spider's Web Forest \"have risen to attack us\".\nWashizu tries to muster his troops, but they ignore his commands and begin firing arrows at him. Several go through his armor, and one pierces his neck, severely wounding him. When he tells them that to kill their lord is treason, they accuse Washizu of the murder of his predecessor. With his enemies approaching the castle gates, he falls to his arrow wounds, trying to draw his sword as he dies. It is then revealed that the attacking force had used trees, cut from the forest during the night, to shield their advance onto the castle.\n\nCast\nCrew\nPersonnel taken from Throne of Blood by Robert N. Watson.\n\nProduction\nDevelopment\nWilliam Shakespeare's plays had been read in Japan since the Meiji Restoration in 1868, though banned during World War II for not being Japanese. Director Akira Kurosawa stated that he had admired Shakespeare's Macbeth for a long time, and that he envisioned making a film adaptation of it after he completed his 1950 film Rashomon. When he learned that Orson Welles had released his own version of Macbeth in 1948, Kurosawa decided to postpone his adaptation project for several years.\nKurosawa believed that Scotland and Japan in the Middle Ages shared social problems and that these had lessons for the present day. Moreover, Macbeth could serve as a cautionary tale complementing his 1952 film Ikiru.\nIn May 1956, Kurosawa announced that he would be producing three samurai films for Toho, Throne of Blood, The Hidden Fortress, and Revenge, each to be filmed from September 1956 to early 1957 by other directors. Ishir\u014d Honda, best known for directing the 1954 kaiju film Godzilla, was slated to direct Throne of Blood, but Kurosawa ended up directing all three films himself.\nThe film combines Shakespeare's play with the Noh style of drama. Kurosawa was an admirer of Noh, which he preferred over Kabuki. In particular, he wished to incorporate Noh-style body movements and set design. Noh also makes use of masks, and the evil spirit is seen, in different parts of the film, wearing faces reminiscent of these masks, starting with yaseonna (old lady). Noh often stresses the Buddhist doctrine of impermanence. This is connected to Washizu being denied salvation, with the chorus singing that his ghost is still in the world. Furthermore, the film score's use of flute and drum are drawn from Noh.\n\nWriting\nAll three of Kurosawa's frequent script collaborators participated for the first time: Hideo Oguni, Shinobu Hashimoto, and Ry\u016bz\u014d Kikushima, each working with the director for their fourth time. Initially, the screenwriters wrote the script with the intention that it would be directed by Ishir\u014d Honda, but Toho insisted Kurosawa take the directing position after reading the script and realizing a large budget was required for the film.\n\nSet design\nThe castle exteriors were built and shot on the volcanic slopes of Mount Fuji. The castle courtyard was constructed at Toho's Tamagawa studio, with volcanic soil brought from Fuji so that the ground matched. The interiors were shot in a smaller studio in Tokyo. The forest scenes were a combination of actual Fuji forest and studio shots in Tokyo. Washizu's mansion was shot in the Izu Peninsula.\n\nIn Kurosawa's own words: \"It was a very hard film to make. We decided that the main castle set had to be built on the slope of Mount Fuji, not because I wanted to show this mountain but because it has precisely the stunted landscape that I wanted. And it is usually foggy. I had decided that I wanted lots of fog for this film... Making the set was very difficult because we didn't have enough people and the location was so far from Tokyo. Fortunately, there was a  U.S. Marine Corps base nearby, and they helped a great deal; also a whole MP battalion helped us out. We all worked very hard indeed, clearing the ground, building the set. Our labor on this steep fog-bound slope, I remember, absolutely exhausted us; we almost got sick.\"\nProduction designer Yoshir\u014d Muraki said the crew opted to employ the color black in the set walls, and a lot of armor, to complement the mist and fog effects. This design was based on ancient scrolls depicting Japanese castles.\n\nSpecial effects\nThe scene in which trees from the Spider's Web Forest approach the castle, was created by Toho's special effects department and directed by Eiji Tsuburaya. Originally, this scene was longer, but Kurosawa cut several shots of trees from the film because he was unimpressed by them.\nWashizu's death scene, in which his own archers turn upon him and shoot him with arrows, was in fact performed with real arrows, shot by knowledgeable and skilled archers. During filming, Mifune waved his arms, which was how the actor indicated his intended bodily direction. This was for his own safety in order to prevent the archers from accidentally hitting him.\n\nRelease\nThe film was released theatrically in Japan on January 15, 1957, by Toho, and grossed \u00a5198 million, making it the second-highest-grossing Japanese film of 1957, after Shintoho's Emperor Meiji and the Great Russo-Japanese War, which grossed \u00a5542.91 million. In the United States, the film was distributed by Brandon Films with English subtitles at 105 minutes and opened on November 22, 1961.\nThrone of Blood was the first film to be screened at the 1st BFI London Film Festival on October 16, 1957. After the screening, Akira Kurosawa attended a party at film critic Dilys Powell's house, and had dinner with actor Laurence Olivier, and actress Vivien Leigh who were planning on playing Macbeth and Lady Macbeth in a film adaptation of William Shakespeare's Macbeth that never materialized. Olivier told Kurosawa that he had enjoyed watching the film and was impressed by the scene in which Toshiro Mifune's Macbeth is shot by arrows. Isuzu Yamada's acting impressed Leigh, and she asked why Yamada made such little movement when she was mad.\nIn 1991, the film was released in the United States on LaserDisc by The Criterion Collection, and on VHS by Media Home Entertainment. Toho released the film on DVD in Japan in 2002 and on Blu-ray in 2010. In 2013, Madman Entertainment distributed the film on DVD in Region 4. In Region A, The Criterion Collection released the film on Blu-ray in 2014, having released the film on DVD 10 years earlier.\nIn 2018, the film was screened by the National Film Archive of Japan at the Essential 2018 National Film Archive Opening Cinema Memorial in Ky\u014dbashi, Tokyo, along with 9 other Japanese films. In 2021, the Kawakita Memorial Film Institute screened a 4K remaster of the film at the 12th 10am Film Festival.\n\nReception\nCritical response\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 96% based on 47 reviews, with an average score of 8.80\/10. The site's consensus states: \"A career high point for Akira Kurosawa \u2013 and one of the best film adaptations of a Shakespeare play.\"\nWhen it was released in the United States in 1961, the Time review praised Kurosawa and the film as \"a visual descent into the hell of greed and superstition\".\nBosley Crowther from The New York Times called the idea of Shakespeare in Japanese \"amusing\", and complimented the cinematography. Most critics stated it was the visuals that filled the gap left by the removal of Shakespeare's poetry.\nU.K. directors Geoffrey Reeve and Peter Brook considered the film to be a masterpiece, but denied it was a Shakespeare film because of the language. Film historian Donald Richie praised the film as \"a marvel because it is made of so little: fog, wind, trees, mist\". Film critic Stephen Prince compared its minimalist landscapes to the painting technique sumi-e.\nDavid Parkinson of Empire magazine rated it 5 out of 5, calling it \"highly cinematic\" and \"a film studded with magnificent set-pieces\".\nThe film has received praise from literary critics despite the many liberties it takes with the original play. The American literary critic Harold Bloom judged it \"the most successful film version of Macbeth\". Sylvan Barnet writes it captured Macbeth as a strong warrior, and that \"Without worrying about fidelity to the original,\" Throne of Blood is \"much more satisfactory\" than most Shakespeare films. Film historian David A. Conrad wrote that just as Shakespeare's play commented on \"questions of legitimacy, masculinity, and civil war\" that resonated in early 17th-century England, Kurosawa's movie engages with contemporary Japanese debates about the \"spiderless cobweb\" of postwar bureaucracy and industry. In his Movie Guide, Leonard Maltin gave the film four stars, calling it a \"graphic, powerful adaptation\".\n\nAccolades\nLegacy\nAkira Kurosawa's 1960 film The Bad Sleep Well, was heavily influenced by William Shakespeare's Hamlet, as well as The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas. Roman Polanski's 1971 film version of Macbeth has similarities to Throne of Blood, in shots of characters on twisted roads, set design, and music to identify locations and psychological conditions. Toshiro Mifune's death scene was the source of inspiration for Piper Laurie's death scene in the 1976 film Carrie, in which knives are thrown at her, in this case by character Carrie White using her psychic powers. In 1985, Kurosawa returned to adapting Shakespeare, choosing the play King Lear for his final epic film Ran, and again moving the setting to feudal Japan.\nThrone of Blood is referenced in the anime film Millennium Actress (2001) in the form of the Forest Spirit\/Witch. It was adapted for the stage by director Ping Chong, premiering at the 2010 Oregon Shakespeare Festival in Ashland, Oregon.\n\nSee also\nThe Bad Sleep Well\nList of Japanese films of 1957\nList of William Shakespeare screen adaptations\nRan\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nThrone of Blood at IMDb\nThrone of Blood at AllMovie\nThrone of Blood at the TCM Movie Database\nThrone of Blood at the official Japanese-language Toho website (archived)\nThe Throne of Blood at the official English-language Toho website (archived)\nThrone of Blood at the Criterion Collection\nThrone of Blood: Shakespeare Transposed an essay by Stephen Prince at the Criterion Collection\nProgram notes from the 1957 San Francisco International Film Festival\nThrone of Blood at the Japanese Movie Database (in Japanese)","228":"Time Out is a global magazine published by Time Out Group. Time Out started as a London-only publication in 1968 and has expanded its editorial recommendations to 333 cities in 59 countries worldwide.\nIn 2012, the London edition became a free publication, with a weekly readership of over 307,000. Time Out's global market presence includes partnerships with Nokia and mobile apps for iOS and Android operating systems. It was the recipient of the International Consumer Magazine of the Year award in both 2010 and 2011 and the renamed International Consumer Media Brand of the Year in 2013 and 2014.\n\nHistory\nTime Out was first published  in 1968 as a London listings magazine by Tony Elliott, who used his birthday money to produce a one-sheet pamphlet, with Bob Harris as co-editor.  The first product was titled Where It's At, before being inspired by Dave Brubeck's album Time Out. Time Out began as an alternative magazine alongside other members of the underground press in the UK, but by 1980 it had abandoned its original collective decision-making structure and its commitment to equal pay for all its workers, leading to a strike and the foundation of a competing magazine, City Limits, by former staffers. By now its former radicalism has all but vanished. As one example of its early editorial stance, in 1976, London's Time Out published the names of 60 purported CIA agents stationed in England. Early issues had a print run of around 5,000 and would evolve to a weekly circulation of 110,000 as it shed its radical roots.\nThe flavour of the magazine was almost wholly the responsibility of its designer, Pearce Marchbank:\n\nMarchbank was invited by Tony Elliott to join the embryonic Time Out in 1971. Turning it into a weekly, he produced its classic logo, [and] established its strong identity and its editorial structure\u2014all still used worldwide to this day.  He also conceived and designed the first of the Time Out guide books. ... He continued to design for Time Out for many years. Each week, his powerful, witty Time Out covers became an essential part of London life.\nElliott launched Time Out New York (TONY), his North American magazine debut, in 1995. The magazine hired young and upcoming talent to provide cultural reviews for young New Yorkers at the time. The success of TONY led to the introduction of Time Out New York Kids, a quarterly magazine aimed at families. The expansion continued with Elliott licensing the Time Out brand worldwide spreading the magazine to roughly 40 cities including Istanbul, Dubai, Beijing, Hong Kong and Lisbon.\nAdditional Time Out products included travel magazines, city guides, and books. In 2010, Time Out became the official publisher of travel guides and tourist books for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.\nTime Out's need to expand to digital platforms led to Elliott, sole owner of the group until November 2010, to sell half of Time Out London and 66 per cent of TONY to private equity group Oakley Capital, valuing the company at \u00a320 million. The group, founded by Peter Dubens, was owned by Tony Elliott and Oakley Capital until 2016, the agreement provided capital for investment to expand the brand. Time Out has subsequently launched websites for an additional 33 cities including Delhi, Washington D.C., Boston, Manchester and Bristol. when it was listed on London's AIM stock exchange. In June 2016, Time Out Group underwent an IPO and is listed on London's AIM stock exchange trading under the ticker symbol 'TMO'.\nThe London edition of Time Out became a free magazine in September 2012. Time Out's London magazine was hand-distributed at central London stations, and received its first official ABC Certificate for October 2012 showing distribution of over 305,000 copies per week, which was the largest distribution in the history of the brand. This strategy increased revenue by 80 per cent with continued upsurge. Time Out has also invited a number of guest columnists to write for the magazine. The columnist as of 2014 was Giles Coren.\nIn April 2015, the New York edition also moved to the free-distribution model to increase the reader base and grow brand awareness. This transition doubled circulation by increasing its web audience, estimated to be around 3.5 million unique visitors a month. Time Out increased its weekly magazine circulation to over 305,000 copies, complementing millions of digital users of Time Out New York. Time Out New York paused printing physical of copies of the magazine in 2020.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Time Out ceased producing paper copies of the magazine and switched to an online-only model. Temporarily rebranding as Time Out In, the publication also refocused its editorial content towards virtual events for people staying at home during the lockdown.\nIn April 2022, it was announced that the print edition of London Time Out would finally cease after 54 years, with its last print run distributed on 23 June 2022. The magazine would continue to be published online.\n\nAdditional ventures\nIn addition to magazines and travel books and websites, Time Out launched Time Out Market, a chain of food courts, starting with the Time Out Market Lisboa in Lisbon, Portugal. New Time Out Markets opened in Miami, New York, Chicago, Boston and Montreal in 2019; and in 2021 in Dubai. New locations are set to open in the future.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website of Time Out (global homepage)","229":"Toho Co., Ltd. (\u6771\u5b9d\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e, T\u014dh\u014d Kabushiki-gaisha) is a Japanese entertainment company primarily engaged in the production and distribution of films and the production and exhibition of stage plays. Its headquarters is in Chiyoda, Tokyo, and is one of the core companies of the Osaka-based Hankyu Hanshin Toho Group. Toho is best known for producing and distributing many of Ishir\u014d Honda and Eiji Tsuburaya's kaiju and tokusatsu films as well as the films of Akira Kurosawa and the anime of Studio Ghibli, CoMix Wave Films, TMS Entertainment, and OLM, Inc. The company has released the majority of the highest-grossing Japanese films, and through its subsidiaries, is the largest film importer in Japan.\nToho's most famous creation is Godzilla, featured in 33 of the company's films. Godzilla, Rodan, Mothra, King Ghidorah, and Mechagodzilla are described as Toho's Big Five due to their numerous appearances throughout the Godzilla franchise, as well as spin-offs. Toho has also been involved in the production of numerous anime titles. Its subdivisions are Toho-Towa Company, Limited (Japanese exclusive theatrical distributor of Universal Pictures via NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan), Towa Pictures Company Limited (Japanese exclusive theatrical distributor of Paramount Pictures), Toho Pictures Incorporated, Toho International Inc., Toho E. B. Company Limited, and Toho Music Corporation & Toho Costume Company Limited. The company is the largest shareholder (7.96%) of Fuji Media Holdings Inc.\nToho is one of the four members of the Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan (MPPAJ), is the largest of Japan's Big Four film studios, and is the only film studio that is a component of the Nikkei 225 index.\nFor filmography, see List of Toho films.\n\nHistory\nToho was created by the founder of the Hankyu Railway, Ichiz\u014d Kobayashi, in 1932 as the Tokyo-Takarazuka Theatre Company (\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u6771\u4eac\u5b9d\u585a\u5287\u5834, Kabushiki gaisha T\u014dky\u014d Takarazuka Gekij\u014d). It managed much of the kabuki in Tokyo and, among other properties, the eponymous Tokyo Takarazuka Theatre and the Imperial Garden Theater in Tokyo; Toho and Shochiku enjoyed a duopoly over theaters in Tokyo for many years.\n\nLabor disputes (1946\u20131948)\nAfter the end of World War II, the new Occupation government allowed and encouraged the formation of labor unions, which had been banned under the Imperial government. During a general strike of film studio employees beginning in October 1946, a group of Toho's ten top stars led by Denjiro Okochi split from the main Toho union along with 445 employees. During the resolution of the strike, a closed-shop provision with the main union led to the establishment of the Shintoho Company, which comprised the members of the dissenting union and former Toho facilities. \nThe loss of major stars led to the hiring and training of new stars, including Toshiro Mifune. The contract made after the strike stipulated that Toho would only produce films approved by a committee that included union members, which led to filmmakers gaining unprecedented creative and productive control over their films. While Toho produced only thirteen films in 1947, six Toho films, including One Wonderful Sunday, directed by Akira Kurosawa, were ranked among the best ten films of the year in Kinema Junpo. However, each film had double or triple the budget of films produced by other studios, and the company suffered severe losses.\nIn 1948, the new Toho president Tetsuzo Watanabe ordered a return of the wartime quota of 24 films per year and the end of control over production by the union.  In April, Toho management announced the dismissal of 1200 employees, with the aim of both cutting expenses and eliminating Communist leaders from the union. Negotiations failed and the union occupied the studio on April 15, joined by activists from the Japan Communist Party and other organizations, erecting barricades and closing the main gates. \nOn August 13, the Tokyo District Court decided in Toho's favor, and on the morning of August 19, a district police chief arrived at the front gate to read out the court decision. Two thousand policemen surrounded the studio, reinforced by soldiers, three airplanes, and several armored cars and tanks sent by the U.S. Eighth Army. The union leaders agreed to end their occupation on the condition the union was not disbanded.\nToho was severely weakened after the strikes and produced only four films in 1948 and five films in 1949, and continued to distribute Shintoho films until the end of 1949.\n\nInternational expansion (1953\u2013present)\nIn May 1953, Toho established Toho International, a Los Angeles-based subsidiary intended to target North American and Latin American markets. Seven Samurai was among the first films offered for foreign sales.\nToho and Shochiku competed with the influx of Hollywood films and boosted the film industry by focusing on new directors of the likes of Akira Kurosawa, Kon Ichikawa, Keisuke Kinoshita, Ishir\u014d Honda, and Kaneto Shindo.\nAfter several successful film exports to the United States during the 1950s through Henry G. Saperstein, Toho took over the La Brea Theatre in Los Angeles to show its films without the need to sell them to a distributor. It was known as the Toho Theatre from the late 1960s until the 1970s. Toho also had a theater in San Francisco and opened a theater in New York City in 1963. The Shintoho Company, which existed until 1961, was named New Toho because it broke off from the original company. Toho has contributed to the production of some American films, including Sam Raimi's 1998 film, A Simple Plan and Paul W. S. Anderson's 2020 military science fiction\/kaiju film, Monster Hunter.\nIn 2019, Toho invested \u00a515.4 billion ($14 million) into their Los Angeles-based subsidiary Toho International Inc. as part of their \"Toho Vision 2021 Medium-term Management Strategy\", a strategy to increase content, platform, real-estate, beat JPY50 billion profits, and increase character businesses on Toho intellectual properties such as Godzilla. Hiroyasu Matsuoka was named the representative director of the US subsidiary.\nIn 2020, Toho acquired a 34.8% stake in the animation studio TIA, with ILCA and Anima each retaining a 32.6% stake. In 2022, Toho acquired Anima's 32.6% stake to take a controlling 67.4% stake in TIA, making the studio a subsidiary, and ultimately renaming the studio into Toho Animation Studios.\nIn December 2023, Toho announced their intent to acquire a 25% stake in Fifth Season for $225 million via Toho International. Following the completion of the deal, Fifth Season will be valued at $900 million; CJ ENM will remain the majority shareholder in the company, with former owner Endeavor also continuing to serve as a strategic shareholder. CEOs Graham Taylor and Chris Rice stated that this investment would empower the company to continue the expansion of its premium slate and create opportunities for collaboration between Fifth Season, Toho and CJ ENM to produce global content as well as content produced in Japan.\nFollowing the success of Godzilla Minus One (2023) as their first self-distributed film in the U.S., Toho declared in March 2024 that Godzilla is their \"Intellectual property (IP) treasure\" and they had regained retailing rights overseas (which were once abandoned), and now are able to sell, advertise, and distribute their own products to consumers outside Japan directly. The company also said that the film winning Best Visual Effects at the 96th Academy Awards is helping them gain more recognition and advancing more business extension overseas.\n\nProductions and distributions\nFilms\nTelevision\nTokusatsu\nIke!

It was screened in 1957 in London, where it won the inaugural Sutherland Trophy the following year, and received praise from U.S. film critics after a 1972 screening in New York City.\nTokyo Story is widely regarded as Ozu's masterpiece and one of the greatest films in the history of cinema. It was voted the greatest film of all time in the 2012 edition of a poll of film directors by Sight and Sound magazine.\n\nPlot summary\nRetired couple Sh\u016bkichi and Tomi Hirayama live in Onomichi in western Japan with their daughter Ky\u014dko, a primary school teacher. They have five adult children, four of whom are living. The couple travel to Tokyo to visit their son, daughter, and widowed daughter-in-law.\nTheir eldest son, K\u014dichi, is a physician who runs a small clinic in Tokyo's suburbs, and their eldest daughter, Shige, runs a hairdressing salon. K\u014dichi and Shige are both busy and do not have much time for their parents. Only their widowed daughter-in-law, Noriko, the wife of their middle son Sh\u014dji, who was missing in action and presumed dead during the Pacific War, goes out of her way to entertain them. She takes time from her busy office job to take Sh\u016bkichi and Tomi on a sightseeing tour of metropolitan Tokyo.\nFeeling conflicted that they do not have time to entertain them, K\u014dichi and Shige pay for their parents to stay at a hot spring spa at Atami, but they return early because the nightlife disturbs their sleep. Tomi also has an unexplained dizzy spell. Upon returning, a frustrated Shige explains she sent them to Atami because she wanted to use their bedroom for a meeting; the elderly couple has to leave for the evening. Tomi goes to stay with Noriko, with whom she deepens their emotional bond, and advises her to remarry. Sh\u016bkichi, meanwhile, gets drunk with some old friends from Onomichi. The three men drunkenly ramble about their children and lives. A policeman brings Sh\u016bkichi and one of his friends to Shige's salon. Shige is outraged her father is lapsing into the alcoholic ways that overshadowed her childhood.\nThe couple remarks on how their children have changed, returning home earlier than planned, intending to see their younger son Keiz\u014d when the train stops in Osaka. However, Tomi suddenly becomes ill during the journey and they decide to disembark the train, staying till she feels better the next day. They return to Onomichi, and Tomi falls critically ill. K\u014dichi, Shige, and Noriko rush to Onomichi to see Tomi, who dies shortly afterwards. Keiz\u014d arrives too late, as he has been away on business.\nAfter the funeral, K\u014dichi, Shige, and Keiz\u014d leave immediately; only Noriko remains. After they leave, Ky\u014dko criticises her siblings over their selfishness toward their parents. She believes that K\u014dichi, Shige, and Keiz\u014d do not care how hard it will be for their father now that he has lost their mother. She is also upset at Shige for asking so quickly for Tomi's clothes as keepsakes. Noriko responds that while she understands Ky\u014dko's disappointment, everyone has their own life and the growing chasm between parents and children is inevitable. She convinces Ky\u014dko not to be too hard on her siblings because one day she will understand how hard it is to take time away from one's own life.\nAfter Ky\u014dko leaves for school, Noriko informs her father-in-law that she must return to Tokyo that afternoon. Sh\u016bkichi tells her that she has treated them better than their own children despite not being a blood relation. Noriko protests that she is selfish and has not always thought about her missing husband, and Sh\u016bkichi credits her self-assessment to humility. He gives her a watch from the late Tomi as a memento. Noriko cries and confesses her loneliness; Sh\u016bkichi encourages her to remarry as soon as possible, wanting her to be happy. Noriko travels from Onomichi back to Tokyo, contemplating the watch, while Sh\u016bkichi remains behind, resigned to the solitude he must endure.\n\nHirayama family tree\nCast\nProduction\nTokyo Story was inspired by the 1937 American film Make Way for Tomorrow, directed by Leo McCarey, which it loosely adapts to the Japanese context and Ozu\u2019s style. Noda, a long-time collaborator of Ozu, initially suggested the plot of the older film to Ozu, who had not seen it. Noda remembered it from its initial release in Japan. Both films depict an elderly couple, their problems with family and travelling to visit their children. Differences include the older film taking place in Depression-era US, with the couple's problem being economical and Tokyo Story taking place in post-war Japan, where the problems are cultural and emotional. The films end differently. David Bordwell wrote that Ozu \"re-cast\" the original film instead of adapting it.\nThe script was developed by Ozu and Noda over a period of 103 days in a ryokan called Chigasakikan in Chigasaki, Kanagawa. Ozu, Noda and cinematographer Y\u016bharu Atsuta scouted locations in Tokyo and Onomichi for another month before shooting started. Shooting and editing took place from July to October 1953. Filming locations were in Tokyo (Adachi, Ch\u016b\u014d, Tait\u014d and Chiyoda), Onomichi, Atami and Osaka. Among the major cast members only Ry\u016b, Hara and Kagawa participated in the Onomichi location. All indoor scenes, except those at the Tokyo Station waiting area and in a passenger car, were shot at the Shochiku \u014cfuna Studio in Kamakura, Kanagawa. Ozu used the same film crew and actors he had worked with for many years. Actor Chish\u016b Ry\u016b said Ozu was always happiest when finishing the final draft of a script and there were never any changes to the final draft.\n\nStyle and themes\nLike all of Ozu's sound films, Tokyo Story's pacing is slow, though Ozu called it his film \"that tends most strongly to melodrama.\" In his narrative storytelling, Ozu often had certain key scenes take place off camera, with the viewer only learning about them through the characters' dialogue. For example, the train journeys to and from Tokyo are not depicted, the audience never sees Sh\u016bkichi and Tomi visit their son Keiz\u014d, and Tomi's illness begins off-screen. \nOzu favored a stationary camera and believed strongly in minimalism. A distinctive camera style is used, in which the camera height is low and almost never moves; film critic Roger Ebert noted that the camera moves once in the film, which is \"more than usual\" for an Ozu film. The low camera positions are reminiscent of sitting on a traditional Japanese tatami mat. Ozu rarely shot master shots and often broke the 180-degree rule of filmmaking and screen direction. Characters, who often sit side by side in scenes, often appear to be facing the same direction when speaking to each other, such as in the first scene with Sh\u016bkichi and Tomi. During some transitions, characters exit a scene screen right and then enter the next scene screen right.\nDavid Desser has compared the film's style and \"de-emphasized plot\" to Zen Buddhism and the modern world's fascination with surface value and materialism. Many of the transitional shots are still lifes of non-human subjects, such as smokestacks and landscapes.\nThemes in the film include the break-up and Westernization of the traditional Japanese family after World War II and the inevitability of children growing apart from their parents. It contrasts the urban life of the children in Tokyo with the rural life of their parents. The film takes place in 1953 post-war Japan, a few years after the new Civil Code of 1948 stimulated the country's rapid re-growth and embraced Western capitalist ideals, while simultaneously destroying older traditions such as the Japanese family and its values. Ozu was very close to his own mother, living with her as a surrogate wife and never marrying.  It is considered a Shomin-geki film for its depiction of ordinary people.\n\nRelease and reception\nTokyo Story was released on November 3, 1953, in Japan. The following year Haruko Sugimura won the Mainichi Film Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role as the eldest daughter Shige.\nIt was screened at the National Film Theatre in London in 1957. It is Ozu's best known film in both the East and the West. After the success of Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon at the 1951 Venice Film Festival, Japanese films began getting international distribution. However, Japanese film exporters considered Ozu's work \"too Japanese\" and unmarketable. It was not until the 1960s that Ozu's films began to be screened in New York City at film festivals, museums, and theaters.\nIn 1958, it was awarded the first Sutherland Trophy for the most original and creative film. UK critic Lindsay Anderson wrote that \"It is a film about relationships, a film about time, and how it affects human beings (particularly parents and children) and how we must reconcile ourselves to its workings.\"\nAfter a screening at the New Yorker Theatre in 1972, it received rave reviews from prominent critics who were unfamiliar with the film or Ozu. Charles Micherer of Newsweek said it was \"like a Japanese paper flower that is dropped into water and then swells to fill the entire container with its beauty.\" Stanley Kauffmann put it on his 10 Best list of 1972 and wrote \"Ozu, a lyrical poet, whose lyrics swell quietly into the epic.\"\n\nBox office\nIn Japan, it was the eighth highest-grossing film of 1953 with \u00a5131.65 million in distributor rental earnings. In France, the film sold 84,646 tickets upon release in 1978. In other European countries, the film sold 92,810 tickets between 1996 and 2021, for a combined 177,456 tickets sold in Europe.\n\nCritical reception\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 100% of 51 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 9.6\/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Tokyo Story is a Yasujiro Ozu masterpiece whose rewarding complexity has lost none of its power more than half a century on.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 100 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". It is also jointly ranked #1 on Metacritic's Filtered \"Best Movies of All Time\". John Walker, former editor of the Halliwell's Film Guides, places Tokyo Story at the top of his published list of the best 1000 films ever made. Tokyo Story is also included in film critic Derek Malcolm's The Century of Films, a list of films which he deems artistically or culturally important, and Time magazine lists it among its All-Time 100 Movies.\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times included it in his series of great movies, and Paul Schrader placed it in the \"Gold\" section of his Film Canon. Martin Scorsese included it on a list of \"39 Essential Foreign Films for a Young Filmmaker.\"\nArthur Nolletti Jr, writing an essay in the book titled Ozu's Tokyo Story compared the film to its USA predecessor film, McCarey's 1937 Make Way for Tomorrow, and indicates that: \"David Bordwell sees Ozu as 'recasting' the American film \u2013 borrowing from it, adapting it \u2013 and briefly mentions that there are similarities in story, theme and plot structure. Indeed these similarities are striking. Both films focus on an elderly couple who discover that their grown children regard them as a burden; both films are structured as journeys in which the couple are shuffled from one household to another; both films explore much of the same thematic material (e.g., sibling self-centeredness and parental disillusionment); and both films are about the human condition \u2013 the cyclical pattern of life with its concomitant joys and sorrows \u2013 and the immediate social realities that affect and shape that condition: in McCarey's film, The Great Depression; in Ozu's, the intensified postwar push toward industrialization. Primarily sober in tone but possessing rich and gentle humor, both films belong to a genre that in Japanese cinema is called shomin-geki, films dealing with the everyday lives of the lower middle classes.\"\nTokyo Story is often admired as a work that achieves great emotional effect while avoiding melodrama. Critic Wally Hammond stated that \"the way Ozu builds up emotional empathy for a sense of disappointment in its various characters is where his mastery lies.\" Roger Ebert wrote that the work \"lacks sentimental triggers and contrived emotion; it looks away from moments a lesser movie would have exploited. It doesn't want to force our emotions, but to share its understanding.\" In The Village Voice, Eric Hynes argued that \"time itself is [Ozu]'s most potent weapon. Protracted sequences make you impatient for forward motion, but then, in an instant, you\u2019re left to mourn beauties hastened away.\" In 2010, David Thomson rhetorically asked whether any other family drama in cinematic history was more moving than Tokyo Story. Ebert called Ozu \"universal\", reported having never heard more weeping in an audience than during its showing, and later stated that the work \"ennobles the cinema. It says, yes, a movie can help us make small steps against our imperfections.\" The Village Voice ranked the film at number 36 in its Top 250 \"Best Films of the Century\" list in 1999, based on a poll of critics.\nTokyo Story was voted at No. 14 on the list of \"100 Greatest Films\" by the prominent French magazine Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma in 2008. In 2009 the film was named The Greatest Japanese Film of All Time by Japanese film magazine Kinema Junpo. Entertainment Weekly voted it the 95th Greatest film of all time. Since 1992, the film has appeared consistently in the British Film Institute's \"polls of the greatest films\" of directors and critics published in Sight and Sound. On the critics' poll, it was third in 1992, fifth in 2002, and third again in 2012. On the directors' poll, it was 17th in 1992, tied at number 16 with Psycho and The Mirror in 2002, and in 2012 it topped the poll, receiving 48 votes out of the 358 directors polled. In 2022, it was 4th in both the critics' and directors' polls. In 2010, The Guardian ranked the film 4th in its list of 25 greatest arthouse films. It ranked 3rd in BBC's 2018 list of The 100 greatest foreign language films voted by 209 \nfilm critics from 43 countries around the world.\n\nInfluence\nGerman director Doris D\u00f6rrie drew inspiration from Tokyo Story for her 2008 film Cherry Blossoms, which follows a similar storyline.\nIn 2013 Y\u014dji Yamada remade the film as T\u014dky\u014d Kazoku.\n\nHome media\nThe film was restored and released on DVD and Blu-ray by The Criterion Collection (Region 1) and by Tartan Video in Region 2. In 2010, the BFI released a Region 2 dual-format edition (Blu-ray + DVD). Included with this release is a standard-definition presentation of Brothers and Sisters of the Toda Family.\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nTokyo Story at IMDb\nTokyo Story at Rotten Tomatoes\nTokyo Story: Compassionate Detachment an essay by David Bordwell at the Criterion Collection","231":"Tsugaru Folk Song (\u6d25\u8efd\u3058\u3087\u3093\u304c\u3089\u7bc0, Tsugaru Jongarabushi) is a 1973 Japanese film directed by K\u014dichi Sait\u014d.

Known for both his comedic and dramatic roles, he is one of the most popular and recognizable film stars worldwide, and is regarded as an American cultural icon. Hanks's films have grossed more than $4.9 billion in North America and more than $9.96 billion worldwide, making him the fourth-highest-grossing actor in North America.\nHanks made his breakthrough with leading roles in a series of comedies: Splash (1984), The Money Pit (1986), Big (1988) and A League of Their Own (1992). He won two consecutive Academy Awards for Best Actor, playing a gay lawyer suffering from AIDS in Philadelphia (1993) and the title character in Forrest Gump (1994). Hanks collaborated with Steven Spielberg on five films: Saving Private Ryan (1998), Catch Me If You Can (2002), The Terminal (2004), Bridge of Spies (2015) and The Post (2017), as well as the World War II miniseries Band of Brothers (2001), The Pacific (2010) and Masters of the Air (2024). He has also frequently collaborated with directors Ron Howard, Nora Ephron and Robert Zemeckis.\nHanks's other films include the romantic comedies Sleepless in Seattle (1993) and You've Got Mail (1998); the dramas Apollo 13 (1995), The Green Mile (1999), Cast Away (2000), Road to Perdition (2002) and Cloud Atlas (2012); and the biographical dramas Charlie Wilson's War (2007), Captain Phillips (2013), Saving Mr. Banks (2013), Sully (2016), A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood (2019), News of the World (2020) and Elvis (2022). He appeared as the title character in the Robert Langdon series and voiced Sheriff Woody in the Toy Story films (1995\u20132019). Hanks directed the comedies That Thing You Do! (1996) and Larry Crowne (2011), and acted in both.\nIn 1998, Hanks launched his production company Playtone, which has an exclusive television development deal with HBO. Hanks has won seven Primetime Emmy Awards for his work as a producer of various limited series and television movies, including From the Earth to the Moon (1998), Band of Brothers (2001), John Adams (2008), The Pacific (2009), Game Change (2012) and Olive Kitteridge (2015). He made his Broadway debut in Nora Ephron's Lucky Guy (2013), earning a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play nomination. Among other honors, he has received the AFI Life Achievement Award (2002), the Kennedy Center Honor (2014), the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the French Legion of Honor (both 2016) and the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award (2020).\n\nEarly life and family\nHanks was born in Concord, California, on July 9, 1956, to hospital worker Janet Marylyn (n\u00e9e Frager) and itinerant cook Amos \"Bud\" Hanks. His mother was from a Portuguese family; their surname was originally \"Fraga\". His father had English ancestry, and through his line, Hanks is a distant cousin of President Abraham Lincoln and children's host Fred Rogers (whom many years later he would portray in a film role). His parents divorced in 1960.\nTheir three oldest children, Sandra (later Sandra Hanks Benoiton, a writer), Larry (who became an entomology professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign), and Tom, went with their father, while the youngest, Jim (who also became an actor and filmmaker), remained with their mother in Red Bluff, California. In his childhood, Hanks' family moved often; by age ten, he had lived in ten different houses. Although Hanks' family religious history was Catholic and Mormon, he converted to Greek Orthodox Christianity as an adult, after his marriage to Rita Wilson.\nOne journalist characterized Hanks' teenage self as being a \"Bible-toting evangelical\" for several years. In school, he was unpopular with students and teachers alike, later telling Rolling Stone magazine, \"I was a geek, a spaz. I was horribly, painfully, terribly shy. At the same time, I was the guy who'd yell out funny captions during filmstrips. But I didn't get into trouble. I was always a real good kid and pretty responsible.\" Hanks acted in school plays, including South Pacific, while attending Skyline High School in Oakland, California.\nHaving grown up in the Bay Area, Hanks says that some of his first movie memories were seeing movies in the Alameda Theatre. Hanks studied theater at Chabot College in Hayward, California, and transferred to California State University, Sacramento after two years. During a 2001 interview with sportscaster Bob Costas, Hanks was asked whether he would rather have an Oscar or a Heisman Trophy. He replied that he would rather win a Heisman by playing halfback for the California Golden Bears. He told New York magazine in 1986, \"Acting classes looked like the best place for a guy who liked to make a lot of noise and be rather flamboyant. I spent a lot of time going to plays. I wouldn't take dates with me. I'd just drive to a theater, buy myself a ticket, sit in the seat and read the program, and then get into the play completely. I spent a lot of time like that, seeing Brecht, Tennessee Williams, Ibsen, and all that.\"\nDuring his years studying theater, Hanks met Vincent Dowling, head of the Great Lakes Theater Festival in Cleveland, Ohio. At Dowling's suggestion, Hanks became an intern at the festival. His internship stretched into a three-year experience that covered most aspects of theater production, including lighting, set design, and stage management, prompting Hanks to drop out of college. During the same time, Hanks won the Cleveland Critics Circle Award for Best Actor for his 1978 performance as Proteus in Shakespeare's The Two Gentlemen of Verona, one of the few times he played a villain. In 2010, Time magazine named Hanks one of the \"Top 10 College Dropouts\".\n\nCareer\n1980\u20131989 Early work, sitcom and comedy films\nIn 1979, Hanks moved to New York City, where he made his film debut in the low-budget slasher film He Knows You're Alone (1980) and landed a starring role in the television movie Mazes and Monsters (1982). Early that year, he was cast as the lead, Callimaco, in the Riverside Shakespeare Company's production of Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli's The Mandrake, directed by Daniel Southern. The following year, Hanks landed one of the lead roles, that of character Kip Wilson, on the ABC television pilot of Bosom Buddies. He and Peter Scolari played a pair of young advertising men forced to dress as women so they could live in an inexpensive all-female hotel. Hanks had previously partnered with Scolari on the 1970s game show Make Me Laugh. After landing the role, Hanks moved to Los Angeles. Bosom Buddies ran for two seasons, and, although the ratings were never strong, television critics gave the program high marks. \"The first day I saw him on the set,\" co-producer Ian Praiser told Rolling Stone, \"I thought, 'Too bad he won't be in television for long.' I knew he'd be a movie star in two years.\"\nHanks made a guest appearance on a 1982 episode of Happy Days (\"A Case of Revenge\", in which he played a disgruntled former classmate of Fonzie) where he met writers Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel who were writing the film Splash (1984), a romantic comedy fantasy about a mermaid who falls in love with a human, to be directed by former Happy Days star Ron Howard. Ganz and Mandel suggested Howard consider Hanks for the film. At first, Howard considered Hanks for the role of the main character's wisecracking brother, a role that eventually went to John Candy. Instead, Hanks landed the lead role in Splash, which went on to become a surprise box office hit, grossing more than US$69 million. He had a sizable hit with the sex comedy Bachelor Party, also in 1984. In 1983\u201384, Hanks made three guest appearances on Family Ties as Elyse Keaton's alcoholic brother Ned Donnelly.\nWith Nothing in Common (1986)\u2014a story of a young man alienated from his father (Jackie Gleason)\u2014Hanks began to extend himself from comedic roles to dramatic. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Hanks commented on his experience: \"It changed my desires about working in movies. Part of it was the nature of the material, what we were trying to say. But besides that, it focused on people's relationships. The story was about a guy and his father, unlike, say, The Money Pit, where the story is really about a guy and his house.\" In 1987, he had signed an agreement with The Walt Disney Studios where he had starred to a talent pool in an acting\/producing pact. After a few more flops and a moderate success with the comedy Dragnet (1987), Hanks' stature in the film industry rose.\n\nThe broad success of the fantasy comedy Big (1988) established Hanks as a major Hollywood talent, both as a box office draw and within the industry as an actor. For his performance in the film, Hanks earned his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. Big was followed later that year by Punchline, in which he and Sally Field co-starred as struggling comedians. Hanks then suffered a run of box-office underperformers: The 'Burbs (1989), Joe Versus the Volcano (1990) and The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990). In the last, he portrayed a greedy Wall Street figure who gets enmeshed in a hit-and-run accident. Turner & Hooch (1989) was Hanks' only financially successful film of the period.\n\n1990\u20131999: Leading man\nHanks climbed back to the top again with his portrayal of a washed-up baseball legend turned manager in Penny Marshall's A League of Their Own (1992). Hanks has said that his acting in earlier roles had not not great, but that he later improved. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Hanks called attention to what he called his \"modern era of moviemaking ... because enough self-discovery has gone on ... My work has become less pretentiously fake and over the top\". This \"modern era\" began in 1993 for Hanks, first with Nora Ephron's Sleepless in Seattle and then with Jonathan Demme's Philadelphia.\nSleepless in Seattle is a romantic comedy about a widower who finds true love over the radio airwaves. Hanks co-starred with Meg Ryan. Richard Schickel of TIME called his performance \"charming\", and most critics agreed that Hanks' portrayal ensured him a place among the premier romantic-comedy stars of his generation. In Philadelphia, he played a gay lawyer with AIDS who sues his firm for discrimination. Hanks lost 35 pounds (16 kg) and thinned his hair in order to appear sickly for the role. In a review for People, Leah Rozen stated, \"Above all, credit for Philadelphia's success belongs to Hanks, who makes sure that he plays a character, not a saint. He is flat-out terrific, giving a deeply felt, carefully nuanced performance that deserves an Oscar.\" Hanks won the 1993 Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in Philadelphia. During his acceptance speech, he revealed that two people with whom he was close, his high school drama teacher Rawley Farnsworth and his former classmate John Gilkerson, were gay.\n\nHanks followed Philadelphia with Robert Zemeckis's Forrest Gump (1994), playing the title character, a man with an IQ of 75 who happens to find himself involved with some of the major events in recent American history. It grossed a worldwide total of over $600 million. Hanks remarked, \"When I read the script for Gump, I saw it as one of those kind of grand, hopeful movies that the audience can go to and feel ... some hope for their lot and their position in life ... I got that from the movies a hundred million times when I was a kid. I still do.\" Hanks won his second Best Actor Academy Award for his role in Forrest Gump, becoming only the second actor to have accomplished the feat of winning consecutive Best Actor Oscars. (Spencer Tracy was the first, winning in 1937 and \u201838 for Captains Courageous and Boys Town. Hanks and Tracy were the same age at the time they received their Academy Awards: 37 years old when they won their first and 38 when they won their second.)\nHanks reunited with Ron Howard to play astronaut and commander Jim Lovell in Apollo 13 (1995). Critics generally applauded the film and the performances of the entire cast, which included Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris and Kathleen Quinlan. The movie earned nine Academy Award nominations, winning two. Hanks also starred in Pixar's Toy Story (1995) as the voice of Sheriff Woody. Hanks made his directing debut with That Thing You Do! (1996), about a 1960s pop group; he also played the role of a music producer in the film. Hanks and producer Gary Goetzman went on to create Playtone, a record and film production company named after the record company in the film.\nHanks then executive produced, co-wrote and co-directed the HBO docudrama From the Earth to the Moon (1998). The 12-part series chronicled the space program from its inception, through the familiar flights of Neil Armstrong and Jim Lovell, to the personal feelings surrounding the reality of Moon landings. The Emmy Award\u2013winning project was, at $68 million (equivalent to $127 million in 2023), one of the most expensive ventures undertaken for television.\nHis next project was no less expensive. For Saving Private Ryan (1998), he worked with Steven Spielberg to make a film about a search through war-torn France after D-Day to bring home a soldier. It earned the praise and respect of the film community, critics and the general public. Hailed as one of the finest war films ever made, it earned Spielberg his second Academy Award for direction, and Hanks another Best Actor nomination. Later that year, Hanks re-teamed with Ephron and Ryan for You've Got Mail, a remake of Ernst Lubitsch's The Shop Around the Corner (1940). He starred in Frank Darabont's The Green Mile (1999), based on the novel of the same name by Stephen King. He reprised the role of Woody in Toy Story 2 (1999).\n\n2000\u20132009: Established star and expansion\nHanks reunited with Zemeckis for Cast Away (2000), playing a marooned FedEx systems analyst. Roger Ebert of The Chicago Sun-Times wrote: \"Hanks proves here again what an effective actor he is, never straining for an effect, always persuasive even in this unlikely situation, winning our sympathy with his eyes and his body language when there's no one else on the screen.\" Hanks co-directed and produced the Emmy Award-winning HBO miniseries Band of Brothers (2001). He also appeared in the September 11 television special America: A Tribute to Heroes and the documentary Rescued From the Closet. In 2002, he teamed up with Sam Mendes for Road to Perdition, an adaptation of the adaptation of Max Allan Collins's and Richard Piers Rayner's comics, in which he played an anti-hero role as a hitman on the run with his son. Hanks reunited with Spielberg, starring opposite Leonardo DiCaprio in Catch Me If You Can (2002), based on the true story of conman Frank Abagnale, Jr. Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson produced My Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002). In August 2007, Hanks, along with co-producers Wilson and Gary Goetzman and writer and star Nia Vardalos, initiated a legal action against the production company Gold Circle Films for their share of profits from the movie. At the age of 45, Hanks became the youngest-ever recipient of the American Film Institute's Life Achievement Award on June 12, 2002.\n\nIn 2004, he appeared in three films: The Coen brothers' The Ladykillers, Spielberg's The Terminal and Zemeckis's The Polar Express, a family film for which Hanks played multiple motion capture roles. In a USA Weekend interview, Hanks discussed how he chooses projects: \"[Since] A League of Their Own, it can't be just another movie for me. It has to get me going somehow ... There has to be some all-encompassing desire or feeling about wanting to do that particular movie. I'd like to assume that I'm willing to go down any avenue in order to do it right\". In August 2005, Hanks was voted in as vice president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Hanks next starred in The Da Vinci Code (2006), which grossed over US$750 million worldwide.  In 2006, Hanks topped a 1,500-strong list of \"most trusted celebrities\" compiled by Forbes magazine. He  produced the animated children's movie The Ant Bully and Starter for Ten, a comedy about working-class students attempting to win on University Challenge.\nHanks did voice work for Ken Burns's documentary The War (2007), reading excerpts from World War II-era columns by Al McIntosh. Hanks voiced himself in The Simpsons Movie (2007), in which he appeared in an announcement claiming that the U.S. government has lost its credibility and is hence buying some of his. He also made an appearance in the credits, expressing a desire to be left alone when he is out in public. He starred in Mike Nichols's Charlie Wilson's War (2007) as Democratic Texas Congressman Charles Wilson. In the comedy-drama film The Great Buck Howard (2008), Hanks played the on-screen father of a young man (played by Hanks' real-life son Colin) who chooses to work as road manager for a fading mentalist (John Malkovich). His character was less than thrilled about his son's career decision. In the same year, he executive produced the musical comedy Mamma Mia! and the miniseries John Adams.\nHanks' next endeavor was Angels & Demons (2009). Its April 11, 2007, announcement revealed that Hanks would reprise his role as Robert Langdon, and that he would reportedly receive the highest salary ever for an actor. The following day he made his 10th appearance on NBC's Saturday Night Live, impersonating himself for the Celebrity Jeopardy sketch. Hanks produced Spike Jonze's Where The Wild Things Are (2009), based on the children's book by Maurice Sendak.\n\n2010\u20132019: Broadway debut and other roles\nHanks reprised his role of Woody in Toy Story 3 (2010) after he, Tim Allen and John Ratzenberger were invited to a movie theater to see a complete story reel of the movie. The film went on to become the highest-grossing animated film at the time. He executive produced the miniseries The Pacific (2010). In 2011, he directed and starred opposite Julia Roberts in the title role in the romantic comedy Larry Crowne. The movie received poor reviews, with only 35% of the 175 Rotten Tomatoes reviews giving it high ratings. Also in 2011, he starred in the drama Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close. In 2012, he voiced the character Cleveland Carr for a web series he created, Electric City. He played multiple parts in Cloud Atlas (2012), based on the novel of the same name by David Mitchell, and was executive producer of the miniseries Game Change.\nIn 2013, Hanks starred in two critically acclaimed films\u2014Paul Greengrass's Captain Phillips and John Lee Hancock's Saving Mr. Banks\u2014which earned him praise, including nominations for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama for the former role. In Captain Phillips, he starred as Captain Richard Phillips with Barkhad Abdi, which was based on the Maersk Alabama hijacking. In Saving Mr. Banks, co-starring Emma Thompson, he was the first actor to portray Walt Disney in a mainstream film. That same year, Hanks made his Broadway debut, starring in Nora Ephron's Lucky Guy, for which he was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play.\n\nIn 2014, Hanks' short story \"Alan Bean Plus Four\" was published in The New Yorker. Revolving around four friends who make a voyage to the moon, the short story is titled after the Apollo 12 astronaut Alan Bean. Slate magazine's Katy Waldman found his first published short story \"mediocre\", writing that \"Hanks' shopworn ideas about technology might have yet sung if they hadn't been wrapped in too-clever lit mag-ese\". In an interview with The New Yorker, Hanks said he has always been fascinated by space. He told the magazine that he built plastic models of rockets when he was a child and watched live broadcasts of space missions back in the 1960s.\nIn March 2015, Hanks appeared in the music video for Carly Rae Jepsen's \"I Really Like You\", lip-syncing most of the song's lyrics as he goes through his daily routine. His next film was Steven Spielberg's Bridge of Spies (2015), in which he played lawyer James B. Donovan, who negotiated for the release of pilot Francis Gary Powers by the Soviet Union in exchange for KGB spy Rudolf Abel. In April 2016, Hanks starred as Alan Clay in the comedy-drama A Hologram for the King, an adaptation of the 2012 novel of the same name. It is the second time he was directed by Tom Tykwer after Cloud Atlas.\nHanks starred as airline captain Chesley Sullenberger in Clint Eastwood's Sully (2016). He next reprised his role as Robert Langdon in Inferno (2016), and co-starred alongside Emma Watson in the 2017 science fiction drama The Circle. He voiced David S. Pumpkins in The David S. Pumpkins Halloween Special, which aired October 28, 2017, on NBC, a character he had portrayed in episodes of Saturday Night Live.\nHanks reprised his role as Sheriff Woody in Pixar's Toy Story 4 (2019). Hanks portrayed Fred Rogers in Marielle Heller's biographical film A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood (2019), for which he was nominated for his first Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.\n\n2020\u2013present\nOn April 11, 2020, Hanks made his first television appearance since his COVID-19 diagnosis by hosting Saturday Night Live. Hanks delivered an opening monologue via his house but did not appear in any of the sketches. This is the first episode of SNL to debut after the show's hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic; it features different sketches filmed remotely from the cast members' homes. This is also a first in SNL history, for the show to be made up entirely of prerecorded content before airing, and the second to not be filmed at Studio 8H. Hanks had two films released in 2020. Hanks starred in Greyhound, a war film which he also wrote the screenplay for. Initially set to be theatrically released in June 2020 by Sony Pictures, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, distribution rights to the film were bought by Apple TV+, where it was released in July 2020. He reunited with Paul Greengrass for the Western News of the World. David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter praised Hanks' performance: \"Hanks has built a career out of playing thoroughly decent men, so his casting here is entirely to type. But the soulfulness and sorrow, the innate compassion that ripple through his characterization make this an enormously pleasurable performance to watch, with new depths of both kindness and regret that keep revealing themselves.\"\nIn 2021, Hanks starred in the science fiction drama Finch, directed by Miguel Sapochnik, and released by Apple TV+. On March 2, 2022, Connor Ratliff appeared as a guest on Late Night With Seth Meyers, where he revealed that Hanks would at last be interviewed for the season three finale of Ratliff's podcast Dead Eyes. The conversation between Hanks and Ratliff took place 22 years after Ratliff was about to begin filming an episode of Band of Brothers, when he was subsequently fired, allegedly because Hanks believed Ratliff had \"dead eyes\". The 90 minute interview was hailed as a momentous achievement in podcasting, a \"rare show that gives you a perfect conclusion\", \"surprisingly funny and empathetic\", and an event Paul Scheer called \"thrilling\".\n\nHanks had three films released in 2022. He first starred as Tom Parker, the manager of Elvis Presley, in Baz Luhrmann's Elvis. Shooting commenced in the beginning of 2020 in Queensland, Australia, and the film was released in June 2022. Hanks next film was portraying Geppetto in Walt Disney Studios' live-action adaptation of Pinocchio. His involvement in the film, which was directed by his longtime collaborator Zemeckis, was officially confirmed in December 2020, and released on September 8, 2022, by Disney+. Hanks' final film of the year was A Man Called Otto, an English-language remake of the Swedish film A Man Called Ove. In 2023, Hanks appeared in Wes Anderson's Asteroid City, starring alongside Jason Schwartzman, Scarlett Johansson, Adrien Brody, Jeffrey Wright and Bryan Cranston. The film premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival to mixed reviews, and was released in June 2023.\nHBO confirmed in January 2013 that it was developing a third World War II miniseries based on the book Masters of the Air by Donald L. Miller with Hanks and Spielberg, to follow Band of Brothers and The Pacific. NME reported in March 2017 that production was progressing under the working title The Mighty Eighth. On October 11, 2019, it was announced that the series would keep the title from the book and that the miniseries would stream on Apple TV+ due to budget constraints at HBO. Masters of the Air was expected to cost $200 million with a duration of at least eight hours. The series premiered on January 26, 2024. Hanks is also appearing in In the Garden of Beasts, an adaptation of the 2011 non fiction book from director Joe Wright about American diplomat William Dodd. In February 2022, it was announced that Hanks will star in the feature adaptation of Here, a graphic novel by Richard McGuire, directed by Robert Zemeckis.\n\nFilmography\nAs an actor\n\nAwards and honors\nIn Hanks' career as an actor and producer, he has received many award nominations.

DeMille Award\n\nReputation and legacy\nHanks is often compared to James Stewart, and has also frequently been referred to as \"America's Dad\". In 2013, when he was starring in Nora Ephron's Lucky Guy on Broadway, he had crowds of 300 fans waiting for a glimpse of him after every performance. This is the highest number of expectant fans post-show of any Broadway performance.\nHanks is ranked as the fifth-highest all-time box office star in North America, with a total gross of over $4.9 billion at the North American box office, an average of $100.8 million per film. Worldwide, his films have grossed over $9.96 billion. Asteroid 12818 Tomhanks is named after him.\nIn 2003, Hanks was voted Number 3 in Channel 4's countdown of the 100 Greatest Movie Stars of All Time, and he is number 22 on VH1's list of the \"200 Greatest Pop Culture Icons of All Time\". He was included on Forbes' list of the top ten most powerful celebrities in the world, in 2000, 2002, and 2003. Hanks was the guest on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs on May 8, 2016; his chosen favorite song, book and luxury item were Richard Strauss' Also sprach Zarathustra by the Vienna Philharmonic, A World Lit Only by Fire by William Manchester, and a Hermes 3000 typewriter and paper, respectively.\nHanks was interviewed five times on WHYY-FM by Terry Gross on the radio show Fresh Air in Philadelphia. Topics included two segments on his lead role in Captain Phillips, a movie about the real life story of a ship's captain hijacked by Somali pirates. Two interviews are about the 12 part miniseries From Earth to the Moon, for which Hanks was executive producer and which was nominated for 17 Emmy Awards. The last interview segment comprises anecdotes shared by Hanks about his acting career.\nRoger Ebert wrote \"of actors who are not 'bigger than life,' but somehow just like life\u2014people who we feel we know and understand, and are comfortable with. We sense that these actors embody not our fantasies, but our lives. Watching them we feel congratulated, because we are watching ourselves. They reassure us that in our ordinariness we also have a kind of importance. The actors who can do that\u2014Buster Keaton, Spencer Tracy, James Stewart, Henry Fonda, Robert Duvall, Gene Hackman, and Tom Hanks, occupy a special category... The central triumph of Tom Hanks as a movie actor is that, most of the time, we believe he thinks a lot like us, and does more or less what we would do, but that he somehow does it on a larger or more ennobling scale. It is the James Stewart quality. But few actors can obtain it; with most, you see their egos peeking through, or you catch them trying too hard. The camera is a lie detector, and Hanks must be a fundamentally good person to play such roles\u2014either that, or he is an even better actor than we think.\"\n\nPersonal life\nMarriage and family\nHanks married American actress Samantha Lewes (1952\u20132002) in 1978. They had one son, actor Colin (b. 1977), and one daughter, Elizabeth (b. 1982). Hanks and Lewes divorced in 1987. Lewes died in 2002 at the age of 49 from bone cancer. Hanks actively attends church. He said, \"I must say that when I go to church\u2014and I do go to church\u2014I ponder the mystery. I meditate on the 'why?' of 'why people are as they are' and 'why bad things happen to good people,' and 'why good things happen to bad people' [...] The mystery is what I think is, almost, the grand unifying theory of all mankind.\"\nIn 1981, Hanks met actress Rita Wilson on the set of TV comedy Bosom Buddies (1980\u20131982). They were reunited in 1985 on the set of Volunteers. Wilson is of Greek and Bulgarian descent, and a member of the Greek Orthodox Church. Before marrying her, Hanks converted to her faith. Hanks and Wilson married in 1988 and have two sons. Their older son, Chet, released a rap song in 2011 and had recurring roles in Empire and Shameless. Their younger son, Truman, was born in 1995, and portrayed the younger version of his father's character in A Man Called Otto (2022). Hanks lives with his family in Los Angeles, California, and Ketchum, Idaho.\nIn October 2013, Hanks said he has type 2 diabetes.\nDespite being a fan of the Oakland Athletics and the Raiders when they were based in Oakland, Hanks stated in April 2017 he would boycott the NFL for two years after the Raiders filed for relocation to Las Vegas. Since 1984, Hanks has been an avid fan of the English Premier League club Aston Villa.\nIn November 2019, shortly before the release of A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, a drama film in which Hanks portrays Fred Rogers, he learned through Ancestry.com that he and Rogers were sixth cousins, both descendants of Johannes Meffert (1732\u20131795), who was born in Sch\u00f6neck, Hesse, Germany (then part of the Holy Roman Empire) and emigrated to the United States in the 18th century, settling in Kentucky and changing his last name to Mefford. Hanks is also a distant relative of the 16th US president, Abraham Lincoln. Hanks narrated the 2011 television program Killing Lincoln.\nOn December 27, 2019, the President of Greece, Prokopis Pavlopoulos, signed an honorary naturalization order for Hanks and his family, citing their \"exceptional services to Greece\", thus making him and his immediate family Greek citizens. Hanks, along with Wilson and their children, were conferred honorary citizenship for their role in bringing global attention and appealing for aid after a devastating wildfire that ripped through the seaside village of Mati, near Athens, in July 2018, which killed more than 100 people. Greece's Interior Minister Takis Theodorikakos said Hanks \"showed real interest in the people who suffered from the fire in Mati and promoted this issue in the global media\". On July 26, 2020, the Prime Minister of Greece, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, accompanied with his wife, handed over Greek passports to both Hanks and Wilson.\n\nPolitical views and activism\nHanks has donated to many Democratic politicians, and during the 2008 United States presidential election uploaded a video to his MySpace account endorsing Barack Obama. He also narrated a 2012 documentary, The Road We've Traveled, created by Obama for America. In 2016, Hanks endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.\nHanks was outspoken about his opposition to the 2008 Proposition 8, an amendment to the California constitution that defined marriage as a union only between a man and a woman. Hanks and others raised over US$44 million to campaign against the proposition. While premiering a TV series in January 2009, Hanks called supporters of Proposition 8 \"un-American\" and criticized LDS Church members, who were major proponents of the bill, for their views on marriage and role in supporting the bill. About a week later, he apologized for the remark, saying that nothing is more American than voting one's conscience.\nA proponent of environmentalism, Hanks is an investor in electric vehicles and owns a Toyota RAV4 EV and the first production AC Propulsion eBox. He was a lessee of an EV1 before it was recalled, as chronicled in the documentary Who Killed the Electric Car? He was on the waiting list for an Aptera 2 Series. Hanks serves as campaign chair of the Hidden Heroes Campaign of the Elizabeth Dole Foundation. The stated mission of the campaign is to inspire a national movement to more effectively support the military and veteran caregivers.\nIn 2004, while touring the White House, Hanks learned that the press corps did not have a coffee pot, and shortly thereafter he donated an espresso machine. He again donated new machines in 2010 and 2017. His 2017 donation was accompanied by a note that read \"To the White House Press Corps, Keep up the good fight for Truth, Justice, and the American Way. Especially for the truth part.\" He endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nVentures and interests\nA supporter of NASA's crewed space program, Hanks said he originally wanted to be an astronaut. Hanks is a member of the National Space Society, serving on the Board of governors of the nonprofit educational space advocacy organization founded by Wernher von Braun. He also produced the HBO miniseries From the Earth to the Moon about the Apollo program to send astronauts to the Moon. In addition, Hanks co-wrote and co-produced Magnificent Desolation: Walking on the Moon 3D, an IMAX film about the Moon landings. Hanks provided the voice-over for the premiere of the show Passport to the Universe at the Rose Center for Earth and Space in the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in New York.\nIn 2006, the Space Foundation awarded Hanks the Douglas S. Morrow Public Outreach Award, given annually to an individual or organization that has made significant contributions to public awareness of space programs.\nIn June 2006, Hanks was inducted as an honorary member of the United States Army Rangers Hall of Fame for his accurate portrayal of a captain in the movie Saving Private Ryan; Hanks, who was unable to attend the induction ceremony, was the first actor to receive such an honor. In addition to his role in Saving Private Ryan, Hanks was cited for serving as the national spokesperson for the World War II Memorial Campaign, for being the honorary chairperson of the D-Day Museum Capital Campaign, and for his role in writing and helping to produce the Emmy Award-winning miniseries, Band of Brothers. On March 10, 2008, Hanks was on hand at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to induct The Dave Clark Five.\nHanks is a collector of manual typewriters and uses them almost daily. In August 2014, Hanks released Hanx Writer, an iOS app meant to emulate the experience of using a typewriter; within days the free app reached number one on the App Store. After contracting and recovering from a COVID-19 infection early in the pandemic, Hanks and his wife donated their blood antibodies for virus research. Hanks is an ordained minister, and on March 24, 2022, CBS News reported that he had recently officiated a wedding in Pittsburgh.\nIn 2023, Hanks founded Hanx for the Troops, a coffee company that supports veterans and military families through a portion of its profits and various initiatives.\n\nBibliography\nHanks wrote a collection of short stories inspired by his typewriter collection, Uncommon Type, which was published in 2017. The Making of Another Major Motion Picture Masterpiece, his debut novel, was published in May 2023.\n\nFurther reading\nGardner, David (1999), Tom Hanks: The Unauthorized Biography, London, ISBN 978-1-85782-327-1\nGardner, David (2007), Tom Hanks: Enigma, ISBN 978-1-84454-428-8\nPfeiffer, Lee (1996), The Films of Tom Hanks, Secaucus, New Jersey, ISBN 978-0-8065-1717-9\nSalamon, Julie (1991), The Devil's Candy: The Bonfire of the Vanities Goes to Hollywood, Boston, ISBN 978-0-385-30824-3\nTrakin, Roy (1995), Tom Hanks: Journey to Stardom, ISBN 978-0-312-95596-0\nWallner, Rosemary (1994), Tom Hanks: Academy Award-Winning Actor, Edina, Minnesota\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nTom Hanks at IMDb \nTom Hanks at Rotten Tomatoes\nTom Hanks at the TCM Movie Database \nTom Hanks at the Internet Broadway Database \nArchive of five Interviews of Hanks by Terry Gross on Fresh Air\nAppearances on C-SPAN","233":"Tragedy (from the Greek: \u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u1ff3\u03b4\u03af\u03b1, trag\u014didia) is a genre of drama based on human suffering and, mainly, the terrible or sorrowful events that befall a main character or cast of characters. Traditionally, the intention of tragedy is to invoke an accompanying catharsis, or a \"pain [that] awakens pleasure,\u201d for the audience. While many cultures have developed forms that provoke this paradoxical response, the term tragedy often refers to a specific tradition of drama that has played a unique and important role historically in the self-definition of Western civilization. That tradition has been multiple and discontinuous, yet the term has often been used to invoke a powerful effect of cultural identity and historical continuity\u2014\"the Greeks and the Elizabethans, in one cultural form; Hellenes and Christians, in a common activity,\" as Raymond Williams puts it.\nFrom its origins in the theatre of ancient Greece 2500 years ago, from which there survives only a fraction of the work of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides, as well as many fragments from other poets, and the later Roman tragedies of Seneca; through its singular articulations in the works of Shakespeare, Lope de Vega, Jean Racine, and Friedrich Schiller to the more recent naturalistic tragedy of Henrik Ibsen and August Strindberg; Natyaguru Nurul Momen's Nemesis' tragic vengeance & Samuel Beckett's modernist meditations on death, loss and suffering; Heiner M\u00fcller postmodernist reworkings of the tragic canon, tragedy has remained an important site of cultural experimentation, negotiation, struggle, and change. A long line of philosophers\u2014which includes Plato, Aristotle, Saint Augustine, Voltaire, Hume, Diderot, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Freud, Benjamin, Camus, Lacan, and Deleuze\u2014have analysed, speculated upon, and criticised the genre.\nIn the wake of Aristotle's Poetics (335 BCE), tragedy has been used to make genre distinctions, whether at the scale of poetry in general (where the tragic divides against epic and lyric) or at the scale of the drama (where tragedy is opposed to comedy). In the modern era, tragedy has also been defined against drama, melodrama, the tragicomic, and epic theatre. Drama, in the narrow sense, cuts across the traditional division between comedy and tragedy in an anti- or a-generic deterritorialisation from the mid-19th century onwards. Both Bertolt Brecht and Augusto Boal define their epic theatre projects (non-Aristotelian drama and Theatre of the Oppressed, respectively) against models of tragedy. Taxidou, however, reads epic theatre as an incorporation of tragic functions and its treatments of mourning and speculation.\n\nEtymology\nThe word \"tragedy\" appears to have been used to describe different phenomena at different times. It derives from Classical Greek \u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u1ff3\u03b4\u03af\u03b1, contracted from trag(o)-aoidi\u0101 = \"goat song\", which comes from tragos = \"he-goat\" and aeidein = \"to sing\" (cf. \"ode\"). Scholars suspect this may be traced to a time when a goat was either the prize in a competition of choral dancing or was what a chorus danced around prior to the animal's ritual sacrifice. In another view on the etymology, Athenaeus of Naucratis (2nd\u20133rd century CE) says that the original form of the word was trygodia from trygos (grape harvest) and ode (song), because those events were first introduced during grape harvest.\nWriting in 335 BCE (long after the Golden Age of 5th-century Athenian tragedy), Aristotle provides the earliest surviving explanation for the origin of the dramatic art form in his Poetics, in which he argues that tragedy developed from the improvisations of the leader of choral dithyrambs (hymns sung and danced in praise of Dionysos, the god of wine and fertility):\n\nAnyway, arising from an improvisatory beginning (both tragedy and comedy\u2014tragedy from the leaders of the dithyramb, and comedy from the leaders of the phallic processions which even now continue as a custom in many of our cities), [tragedy] grew little by little, as [the poets] developed whatever [new part] of it had appeared; and, passing through many changes, tragedy came to a halt, since it had attained its own nature. \nIn the same work, Aristotle attempts to provide a scholastic definition of what tragedy is:\n\nTragedy is, then, an enactment of a deed that is important and complete, and of [a certain] magnitude, by means of language enriched [with ornaments], each used separately in the different parts [of the play]: it is enacted, not [merely] recited, and through pity and fear it effects relief (catharsis) to such [and similar] emotions. \nThere is some dissent to the dithyrambic origins of tragedy, mostly based on the differences between the shapes of their choruses and styles of dancing. A common descent from pre-Hellenic fertility and burial rites has been suggested. Friedrich Nietzsche discussed the origins of Greek tragedy in his early book The Birth of Tragedy (1872). Here, he suggests the name originates in the use of a chorus of goat-like satyrs in the original dithyrambs from which the tragic genre developed.\n\nScott Scullion writes:  There is abundant evidence for tragoidia understood as \"song for the prize goat\". The best-known evidence is Horace, Ars poetica 220-24 (\"he who with a tragic song competed for a mere goat\"); the earliest is the Parian Marble, a chronicle inscribed about 264\/63 BCE, which records, under a date between 538 and 528 BCE: \"Thespis is the poet ... first produced ... and as prize was established the billy goat\" (FrGHist 239A, epoch 43); the clearest is Eustathius 1769.45: \"They called those competing tragedians, clearly because of the song over the billy goat\"...\n\nGreek\nAthenian tragedy\u2014the oldest surviving form of tragedy\u2014is a type of dance-drama that formed an important part of the theatrical culture of the city-state. Having emerged sometime during the 6th century BCE, it flowered during the 5th century BCE (from the end of which it began to spread throughout the Greek world), and continued to be popular until the beginning of the Hellenistic period. No tragedies from the 6th century and only 32 of the more than a thousand that were performed in the 5th century have survived. We have complete texts extant by Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. Aeschylus' The Persians is recognized to be the earliest extant Greek tragedy, and as such it is doubly unique among the extant ancient dramas.\nAthenian tragedies were performed in late March\/early April at an annual state religious festival in honor of Dionysus. The presentations took the form of a contest between three playwrights, who presented their works on three successive days. Each playwright offered a tetralogy consisting of three tragedies and a concluding comic piece called a satyr play. The four plays sometimes featured linked stories. Only one complete trilogy of tragedies has survived, the Oresteia of Aeschylus. The Greek theatre was in the open air, on the side of a hill, and performances of a trilogy and satyr play probably lasted most of the day. Performances were apparently open to all citizens, including women, but evidence is scant. The theatre of Dionysus at Athens probably held around 12,000 people.\nAll of the choral parts were sung (to the accompaniment of an aulos) and some of the actors' answers to the chorus were sung as well. The play as a whole was composed in various verse metres. All actors were male and wore masks. A Greek chorus danced as well as sang, though no one knows exactly what sorts of steps the chorus performed as it sang. Choral songs in tragedy are often divided into three sections: strophe (\"turning, circling\"), antistrophe (\"counter-turning, counter-circling\") and epode (\"after-song\").\nMany ancient Greek tragedians employed the ekkykl\u00eama as a theatrical device, which was a platform hidden behind the scene that could be rolled out to display the aftermath of some event which had happened out of sight of the audience. This event was frequently a brutal murder of some sort, an act of violence which could not be effectively portrayed visually, but an action of which the other characters must see the effects for it to have meaning and emotional resonance. A prime example of the use of the ekkykl\u00eama is after the murder of Agamemnon in the first play of Aeschylus' Oresteia, when the king's butchered body is wheeled out in a grand display for all to see. Variations on the ekkykl\u00eama are used in tragedies and other forms to this day, as writers still find it a useful and often powerful device for showing the consequences of extreme human actions. Another such device was a crane, the mechane, which served to hoist a god or goddess on stage when they were supposed to arrive flying. This device gave origin to the phrase \"deus ex machina\" (\"god out of a machine\"), that is, the surprise intervention of an unforeseen external factor that changes the outcome of an event.\n\nRoman\nFollowing the expansion of the Roman Republic (509\u201327 BCE) into several Greek territories between 270 and 240 BCE, Rome encountered Greek tragedy. From the later years of the republic and by means of the Roman Empire (27 BCE-476 CE), theatre spread west across Europe, around the Mediterranean and even reached Britain. While Greek tragedy continued to be performed throughout the Roman period, the year 240 BCE marks the beginning of regular Roman drama. Livius Andronicus began to write Roman tragedies, thus creating some of the first important works of Roman literature. Five years later, Gnaeus Naevius also began to write tragedies (though he was more appreciated for his comedies). No complete early Roman tragedy survives, though it was highly regarded in its day; historians know of three other early tragic playwrights\u2014Quintus Ennius, Marcus Pacuvius and Lucius Accius.\nFrom the time of the empire, the tragedies of two playwrights survive\u2014one is an unknown author, while the other is the Stoic philosopher Seneca. Nine of Seneca's tragedies survive, all of which are fabula crepidata (tragedies adapted from Greek originals); his Phaedra, for example, was based on Euripides' Hippolytus. Historians do not know who wrote the only extant example of the fabula praetexta (tragedies based on Roman subjects), Octavia, but in former times it was mistakenly attributed to Seneca due to his appearance as a character in the tragedy.\nSeneca's tragedies rework those of all three of the Athenian tragic playwrights whose work has survived. Probably meant to be recited at elite gatherings, they differ from the Greek versions in their long declamatory, narrative accounts of action, their obtrusive moralising, and their bombastic rhetoric. They dwell on detailed accounts of horrible deeds and contain long reflective soliloquies. Though the gods rarely appear in these plays, ghosts and witches abound. Senecan tragedies explore ideas of revenge, the occult, the supernatural, suicide, blood and gore. The Renaissance scholar Julius Caesar Scaliger (1484\u20131558), who knew both Latin and Greek, preferred Seneca to Euripides.\n\nRenaissance\nInfluence of Greek and Roman\nClassical Greek drama was largely forgotten in Western Europe from the Middle Ages to the beginning of the 16th century. Medieval theatre was dominated by mystery plays, morality plays, farces and miracle plays. In Italy, the models for tragedy in the later Middle Ages were Roman, particularly the works of Seneca, interest in which was reawakened by the Paduan Lovato de' Lovati (1241\u20131309). His pupil Albertino Mussato (1261\u20131329), also of Padua, in 1315 wrote the Latin verse tragedy Eccerinis, which uses the story of the tyrant Ezzelino III da Romano to highlight the danger to Padua posed by Cangrande della Scala of Verona. It was the first secular tragedy written since Roman times, and may be considered the first Italian tragedy identifiable as a Renaissance work. The earliest tragedies to employ purely classical themes are the Achilles written before 1390 by Antonio Loschi of Vicenza (c.1365\u20131441) and the Progne of the Venetian Gregorio Correr (1409\u20131464) which dates from 1428 to 1429.\nIn 1515 Gian Giorgio Trissino (1478\u20131550) of Vicenza wrote his tragedy Sophonisba in the vernacular that would later be called Italian. Drawn from Livy's account of Sophonisba, the Carthaginian princess who drank poison to avoid being taken by the Romans, it adheres closely to classical rules. It was soon followed by the Oreste and Rosmunda of Trissino's friend, the Florentine Giovanni di Bernardo Rucellai (1475\u20131525). Both were completed by early 1516 and are based on classical Greek models, Rosmunda on the Hecuba of Euripides, and Oreste on the Iphigenia in Tauris of the same author; like Sophonisba, they are in Italian and in blank (unrhymed) hendecasyllables. Another of the first of all modern tragedies is A Castro, by Portuguese poet and playwright Ant\u00f3nio Ferreira, written around 1550 (but only published in 1587) in polymetric verse (most of it being blank hendecasyllables), dealing with the murder of In\u00eas de Castro, one of the most dramatic episodes in Portuguese history. Although these three Italian plays are often cited, separately or together, as being the first regular tragedies in modern times, as well as the earliest substantial works to be written in blank hendecasyllables, they were apparently preceded by two other works in the vernacular: Pamfila or Filostrato e Panfila written in 1498 or 1508 by Antonio Cammelli (Antonio da Pistoia); and a Sophonisba by Galeotto del Carretto of 1502.\nFrom about 1500 printed copies, in the original languages, of the works of Sophocles, Seneca, and Euripides, as well as comedic writers such as Aristophanes, Terence and Plautus, were available in Europe and the next forty years saw humanists and poets translating and adapting their tragedies. In the 1540s, the European university setting (and especially, from 1553 on, the Jesuit colleges) became host to a Neo-Latin theatre (in Latin) written by scholars. The influence of Seneca was particularly strong in its humanist tragedy. His plays, with their ghosts, lyrical passages and rhetorical oratory, brought a concentration on rhetoric and language over dramatic action to many humanist tragedies.\nThe most important sources for French tragic theatre in the Renaissance were the example of Seneca and the precepts of Horace and Aristotle (and contemporary commentaries by Julius Caesar Scaliger and Lodovico Castelvetro), although plots were taken from classical authors such as Plutarch, Suetonius, etc., from the Bible, from contemporary events and from short story collections (Italian, French and Spanish). The Greek tragic authors (Sophocles and Euripides) would become increasingly important as models by the middle of the 17th century. Important models were also supplied by the Spanish Golden Age playwrights Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca, Tirso de Molina and Lope de Vega, many of whose works were translated and adapted for the French stage.\n\nBritain\nThe common forms are the:\n\nTragedy of circumstance: people are born into their situations, and do not choose them; such tragedies explore the consequences of birthrights, particularly for monarchs\nTragedy of miscalculation: the protagonist's error of judgement has tragic consequences\nRevenge play\nIn English, the most famous and most successful tragedies are those of William Shakespeare and his Elizabethan contemporaries. Shakespeare's tragedies include:\n\nAntony and Cleopatra\nCoriolanus\nHamlet\nJulius Caesar\nKing Lear\nMacbeth\nOthello\nRomeo and Juliet\nTimon of Athens\nTitus Andronicus\nTroilus and Cressida\nA contemporary of Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe, also wrote examples of tragedy in English, notably:\n\nThe Tragical History of Doctor Faustus\nTamburlaine the Great\nJohn Webster (1580?\u20131635?), also wrote famous plays of the genre:\n\nThe Duchess of Malfi\nThe White Devil\n\nDomestic tragedy\nDomestic tragedies are tragedies in which the tragic protagonists are ordinary middle-class or working-class individuals. This subgenre contrasts with classical and Neoclassical tragedy, in which the protagonists are of kingly or aristocratic rank and their downfall is an affair of state as well as a personal matter.\nThe Ancient Greek theorist Aristotle had argued that tragedy should concern only great individuals with great minds and souls, because their catastrophic downfall would be more emotionally powerful to the audience; only comedy should depict middle-class people. Domestic tragedy breaks with Aristotle's precepts, taking as its subjects merchants or citizens whose lives have less consequence in the wider world.\nThe advent of the domestic tragedy ushered in the first phase shift of the genre focusing less on the Aristotelian definition of the genre and more on the definition of tragedy on the scale of the drama, where tragedy is opposed to comedy i.e. melancholic stories. Although the utilization of key elements such as suffering, hamartia, morality, and spectacle ultimately ties this variety of tragedy to all the rest. This variant of tragedy has led to the evolution and development of tragedies of the modern era especially those past the mid-1800s such as the works of Arthur Miller, Eugene O'Neill and Henrik Ibsen. Newly dealt with themes that sprang forth from the Domestic tragedy movement include: wrongful convictions and executions, poverty, starvation, addiction, alcoholism, debt, structural abuse, child abuse, crime, domestic violence, social shunning, depression, and loneliness.\nClassical Domestic tragedies include:\n\nArden of Faversham (1592)\nA Woman Killed with Kindness (1607)\nA Yorkshire Tragedy (1608)\nThe Witch of Edmonton (1621)\n\nOpera\nContemporary with Shakespeare, an entirely different approach to facilitating the rebirth of tragedy was taken in Italy. Jacopo Peri, in the preface to his Euridice refers to \"the ancient Greeks and Romans (who in the opinion of many sang their staged tragedies throughout in representing them on stage).\" The attempts of Peri and his contemporaries to recreate ancient tragedy gave rise to the new Italian musical genre of opera. In France, tragic operatic works from the time of Lully to about that of Gluck were not called opera, but trag\u00e9die en musique (\"tragedy in music\") or some similar name; the trag\u00e9die en musique is regarded as a distinct musical genre. Some later operatic composers have also shared Peri's aims: Richard Wagner's concept of Gesamtkunstwerk (\"integrated work of art\"), for example, was intended as a return to the ideal of Greek tragedy in which all the arts were blended in service of the drama. Nietzsche, in his The Birth of Tragedy (1872) was to support Wagner in his claims to be a successor of the ancient dramatists.\n\nNeo-classical\nFor much of the 17th century, Pierre Corneille, who made his mark on the world of tragedy with plays like Med\u00e9e (1635) and Le Cid (1636), was the most successful writer of French tragedies. Corneille's tragedies were strangely un-tragic (his first version of Le Cid was even listed as a tragicomedy), for they had happy endings. In his theoretical works on theatre, Corneille redefined both comedy and tragedy around the following suppositions:\n\nThe stage\u2014in both comedy and tragedy\u2014should feature noble characters (this would eliminate many low-characters, typical of the farce, from Corneille's comedies). Noble characters should not be depicted as vile (reprehensible actions are generally due to non-noble characters in Corneille's plays).\nTragedy deals with affairs of the state (wars, dynastic marriages); comedy deals with love. For a work to be tragic, it need not have a tragic ending.\nAlthough Aristotle says that catharsis (purgation of emotion) should be the goal of tragedy, this is only an ideal. In conformity with the moral codes of the period, plays should not show evil being rewarded or nobility being degraded.\nCorneille continued to write plays through 1674 (mainly tragedies, but also something he called \"heroic comedies\") and many continued to be successes, although the \"irregularities\" of his theatrical methods were increasingly criticised (notably by Fran\u00e7ois H\u00e9delin, abb\u00e9 d'Aubignac) and the success of Jean Racine from the late 1660s signalled the end of his preeminence.\nJean Racine's tragedies\u2014inspired by Greek myths, Euripides, Sophocles and Seneca\u2014condensed their plot into a tight set of passionate and duty-bound conflicts between a small group of noble characters, and concentrated on these characters' double-binds and the geometry of their unfulfilled desires and hatreds. Racine's poetic skill was in the representation of pathos and amorous passion (like Ph\u00e8dre's love for her stepson) and his impact was such that emotional crisis would be the dominant mode of tragedy to the end of the century. Racine's two late plays (\"Esther\" and \"Athalie\") opened new doors to biblical subject matter and to the use of theatre in the education of young women. Racine also faced criticism for his irregularities: when his play, B\u00e9r\u00e9nice, was criticised for not containing any deaths, Racine disputed the conventional view of tragedy.\nFor more on French tragedy of the 16th and 17th centuries, see French Renaissance literature and French literature of the 17th century.\n\nLater development\nTowards the close of the eighteenth century, having studied her predecessors, Joanna Baillie wanted to revolutionise theatre, believing that it could be used more effectively to affect people's lives. To this end she gave a new direction to tragedy, which she as 'the unveiling of the human mind under the dominion of those strong and fixed passions, which seemingly unprovoked by outward circumstances, will from small beginnings brood within the breast, till all the better dispositions, all the fair gifts of nature are borne down before them'. \nThis theory, she put into practice in her 'Series of Plays on the Passions' in three volumes (commencing in 1798) and in other dramatic works. Her method was to create a series of scenes and incidents intended to capture the audience's inquisitiveness and 'trace the progress of the passion, pointing out those stages in the approach of the enemy, when he might have been combated most successfully; and where the suffering him to pass may be considered as occasioning all the misery that ensues.'\n\nBourgeois\nBourgeois tragedy (German: B\u00fcrgerliches Trauerspiel) is a form that developed in 18th-century Europe. It was a fruit of the Enlightenment and the emergence of the bourgeois class and its ideals. It is characterised by the fact that its protagonists are ordinary citizens. The first true bourgeois tragedy was an English play, George Lillo's The London Merchant; or, the History of George Barnwell, which was first performed in 1731. Usually, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's play Miss Sara Sampson, which was first produced in 1755, is said to be the earliest B\u00fcrgerliches Trauerspiel in Germany.\n\nModern development\nIn modernist literature, the definition of tragedy has become less precise. The most fundamental change has been the rejection of Aristotle's dictum that true tragedy can only depict those with power and high status. Arthur Miller's essay \"Tragedy and the Common Man\" (1949) argues that tragedy may also depict ordinary people in domestic surroundings thus defining Domestic tragedies. British playwright Howard Barker has argued strenuously for the rebirth of tragedy in the contemporary theatre, most notably in his volume Arguments for a Theatre. \"You emerge from tragedy equipped against lies. After the musical, you're anybody's fool,\" he insists.\nCritics such as George Steiner have even been prepared to argue that tragedy may no longer exist in comparison with its former manifestations in classical antiquity. In The Death of Tragedy (1961) George Steiner outlined the characteristics of Greek tragedy and the traditions that developed from that period. In the Foreword (1980) to a new edition of his book Steiner concluded that 'the dramas of Shakespeare are not a renascence of or a humanistic variant of the absolute tragic model. They are, rather, a rejection of this model in the light of tragi-comic and \"realistic\" criteria.' In part, this feature of Shakespeare's mind is explained by his bent of mind or imagination which was 'so encompassing, so receptive to the plurality of diverse orders of experience.' When compared to the drama of Greek antiquity and French classicism Shakespeare's forms are 'richer but hybrid'.\nNumerous books and plays continue to be written in the tradition of tragedy to this day examples include Froth on the Daydream, The Road, The Fault in Our Stars, Fat City, Rabbit Hole, Requiem for a Dream, The Handmaid's Tale.\n\nTheories\nDefining tragedy is no simple matter, and there are many definitions, some of which are incompatible with each other. Oscar Mandel, in A Definition of Tragedy (1961), contrasted two essentially different means of arriving at a definition. First is what he calls the derivative way, in which the tragedy is thought to be an expression of an ordering of the world; \"instead of asking what tragedy expresses, the derivative definition tends to ask what expresses itself through tragedy\". The second is the substantive way of defining tragedy, which starts with the work of art which is assumed to contain the ordering of the world. Substantive critics \"are interested in the constituent elements of art, rather than its ontological sources\". He recognizes four subclasses: a. \"definition by formal elements\" (for instance the supposed \"three unities\"); b. \"definition by situation\" (where one defines tragedy for instance as \"exhibiting the fall of a good man\"); c. \"definition by ethical direction\" (where the critic is concerned with the meaning, with the \"intellectual and moral effect); and d. \"definition by emotional effect\" (and he cites Aristotle's \"requirement of pity and fear\").\n\nAristotle\nAristotle wrote in his work Poetics that\ntragedy is characterised by seriousness and involves a great person who experiences a reversal of fortune (Peripeteia). Aristotle's definition can include a change of fortune from bad to good as in the Eumenides, but he says that the change from good to bad as in Oedipus Rex is preferable because this induces pity and fear within the spectators. Tragedy results in a catharsis (emotional cleansing) or healing for the audience through their experience of these emotions in response to the suffering of the characters in the drama.\nAccording to Aristotle, \"the structure of the best tragedy should not be simple but complex and one that represents incidents arousing fear and pity\u2014for that is peculiar to this form of art.\" This reversal of fortune must be caused by the tragic hero's hamartia, which is often translated as either a character flaw, or as a mistake (since the original Greek etymology traces back to hamartanein, a sporting term that refers to an archer or spear-thrower missing his target). According to Aristotle, \"The misfortune is brought about not by [general] vice or depravity, but by some [particular] error or frailty.\" The reversal is the inevitable but unforeseen result of some action taken by the hero. It is also a misconception that this reversal can be brought about by a higher power (e.g. the law, the gods, fate, or society), but if a character's downfall is brought about by an external cause, Aristotle describes this as a misadventure and not a tragedy.\nIn addition, the tragic hero may achieve some revelation or recognition (anagnorisis\u2014\"knowing again\" or \"knowing back\" or \"knowing throughout\") about human fate, destiny, and the will of the gods. Aristotle terms this sort of recognition \"a change from ignorance to awareness of a bond of love or hate.\"\nIn Poetics, Aristotle gave the following definition in ancient Greek of the word \"tragedy\" (\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u1ff3\u03b4\u03af\u03b1):\n\nTragedy is an imitation of an action that is admirable, complete (composed of an introduction, a middle part and an ending), and possesses magnitude; in language made pleasurable, each of its species separated in different parts; performed by actors, not through narration; effecting through pity and fear the purification of such emotions.\nCommon usage of tragedy refers to any story with a sad ending, whereas to be an Aristotelian tragedy the story must fit the set of requirements as laid out by Poetics. By this definition social drama cannot be tragic because the hero in it is a victim of circumstance and incidents that depend upon the society in which he lives and not upon the inner compulsions\u2014psychological or religious\u2014which determine his progress towards self-knowledge and death. Exactly what constitutes a \"tragedy\", however, is a frequently debated matter.\nAccording to Aristotle, there are four species of tragedy:\n\nComplex, which involves Peripety and Discovery\nSuffering, tragedies of such nature can be seen in the Greek mythological stories of Ajaxes and Ixions\nCharacter, a tragedy of moral or ethical character. Tragedies of this nature can be found in Phthiotides and Peleus\nSpectacle, that of a horror-like theme. Examples of this nature are Phorcides and Prometheus\n\nHegel\nG.W.F. Hegel, the German philosopher most famous for his dialectical approach to epistemology and history, also applied such a methodology to his theory of tragedy. In his essay \"Hegel's Theory of Tragedy,\" A.C. Bradley first introduced the English-speaking world to Hegel's theory, which Bradley called the \"tragic collision\", and contrasted against the Aristotelian notions of the \"tragic hero\" and his or her \"hamartia\" in subsequent analyses of the Aeschylus' Oresteia trilogy and of Sophocles' Antigone. Hegel himself, however, in his seminal \"The Phenomenology of Spirit\" argues for a more complicated theory of tragedy, with two complementary branches which, though driven by a single dialectical principle, differentiate Greek tragedy from that which follows Shakespeare. His later lectures formulate such a theory of tragedy as a conflict of ethical forces, represented by characters, in ancient Greek tragedy, but in Shakespearean tragedy the conflict is rendered as one of subject and object, of individual personality which must manifest self-destructive passions because only such passions are strong enough to defend the individual from a hostile and capricious external world:\n\nThe heroes of ancient classical tragedy encounter situations in which, if they firmly decide in favor of the one ethical pathos that alone suits their finished character, they must necessarily come into conflict with the equally [gleichberechtigt] justified ethical power that confronts them. Modern characters, on the other hand, stand in a wealth of more accidental circumstances, within which one could act this way or that, so that the conflict is, though occasioned by external preconditions, still essentially grounded in the character. The new individuals, in their passions, obey their own nature... simply because they are what they are. Greek heroes also act in accordance with individuality, but in ancient tragedy such individuality is necessarily... a self-contained ethical pathos...  In modern tragedy, however, the character in its peculiarity decides in accordance with subjective desires... such that congruity of character with outward ethical aim no longer constitutes an essential basis of tragic beauty...\nHegel's comments on a particular play may better elucidate his theory: \"Viewed externally, Hamlet's death may be seen to have been brought about accidentally... but in Hamlet's soul, we understand that death has lurked from the beginning: the sandbank of finitude cannot suffice his sorrow and tenderness, such grief and nausea at all conditions of life... we feel he is a man whom inner disgust has almost consumed well before death comes upon him from outside.\"\n\nSee also\nClassicism\nTrag\u00e9dies en musique\nShe-tragedy\nRevenge tragedy\n\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\nExternal links\n\nTragedy on In Our Time at the BBC\nToscano, Alberto.

It is based on the 1912 novel Tsuchi by poet Takashi Nagatsuka.\n\nPlot\nThe plot of Earth focuses on a family of farmers who are down on their luck, but also extensively depicts the rural community's milieu, daily work and way of life. Kanji is embittered because he has to pay off the debts of his dead wife's father. He is also overly protective of his daughter, Otsugi, which severely restricts her interaction with the community.\n\nCast\nIsamu Kosugi as Kanji\nAkiko Kazami as Otsugi\nKaichi Yamamoto as Ukichi\n\nProduction\nDirector Tomu Uchida's original plan to film Nagatsuka's famous novel was turned down by Nikkatsu, the studio to which he was under contract. While Uchida was working on other projects for the studio, he began filming Tsuchi on weekends without authorization. This secret filming included on-location shooting in Japan. Once Nikkatsu caught wind of what was happening it was too late; the production was too far along for the studio to halt it. The management feared losing face with its workers, who had already put in a lot of time making the film, so Nikkatsu decided to complete the film and released it to the public to unexpected commercial success.\n\nVersions\nA seriously compromised print of Earth was discovered in Germany in 1968. It suffers from nitrate damage and includes German subtitles. It is missing its first and last reel. The original film was 142 minutes long; this version runs 93 minutes. A longer version of the film was discovered in Moscow's Gosfilmofond in 1999. It, too, is missing the last reel.\n\nLegacy\nEarth was screened in a restored, though still incomplete print, incorporating the Gosfilmofond version, at the Museum of Modern Art as part of a retrospective on Tomu Uchida in 2016.\nJapanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited Earth as one of his 100 favorite films.\n\nAwards\nEarth won the 1940 Kinema Junpo Award for Best Film.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nTsuchi at IMDb","235":"Turner Classic Movies (TCM) is an American movie-oriented pay-TV network owned by Warner Bros. Discovery. Launched in 1994, Turner Classic Movies is headquartered at Turner's Techwood broadcasting campus in the Midtown business district of Atlanta, Georgia.\nThe channel's programming consists mainly of classic theatrically released feature films from the Turner Entertainment Co. film library \u2013 which comprises films from Warner Bros. (covering films released before 1950), Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (covering films released before May 1986), and the North American distribution rights to films from RKO Radio Pictures. However, Turner Classic Movies also licenses films from other studios and occasionally shows more recent films.\nThe channel is available in the United States, Canada, Malta (as Turner Classic Movies), Latin America, France, Greece, Cyprus, Spain, the Middle East & Africa (as TNT)\n\nHistory\nOrigins\nIn 1985, nine years before the launch of Turner Classic Movies, Ted Turner announced plans to acquire the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) film studio for $1.5 billion. On March 25, 1986, the deal was finalized, with Turner renaming the studio MGM Entertainment Co. Furthermore, Turner's purchase of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer separated the studio from United Artists, which remained with Kirk Kerkorian, after they had merged in 1981. However, concerns over MGM and Turner Broadcasting's corporate debt load (totaling $2 billion) resulted in Turner selling the studio back to Kerkorian, from whom Turner had purchased the studio less than a year before. \nOn August 26, 1986, Turner sold MGM's production and distribution assets for $300 million to United Artists, while MGM's production and film laboratories were sold for $190 million to Lorimar-Telepictures. However, Turner Broadcasting still retained the MGM film library, primarily for its cable \"superstation\" WTBS. Following the exchange, Turner rebranded his organization Turner Entertainment Company. \nThe film library of Turner Entertainment Co. would serve as the base form of programming for Turner Classic Movies upon the network's launch. Before the creation of Turner Classic Movies, films from Turner's library of movies aired on the Turner Broadcasting System's advertiser-supported cable network TNT along with colorized versions of black-and-white classics such as The Maltese Falcon.\n\nLaunch and contributions (1994\u20131996)\nTurner Classic Movies debuted on April 14, 1994, at 6 p.m. Eastern Time, with Ted Turner launching the channel at a ceremony in New York City's Times Square district. The date and time were chosen to mark the exact centennial anniversary of the first commercial exhibition of a motion picture in the United States. Gone with the Wind (1939) was the first film broadcast on TCM; it was also the same film that served as the debut broadcast of its sister channel TNT six years earlier on October 3, 1988. At the time of its launch, Turner Classic Movies was available to approximately 1 million cable television subscribers.\nThe network originally served as a competitor to AMC, which at the time was known as \"American Movie Classics\" and maintained a virtually identical format to Turner Classic Movies, as both networks largely focused on films released prior to 1970 and aired them in an uncut, uncolorized, and commercial-free format.\n\nTime Warner ownership (1996\u20132018)\nIn 1996, Turner Broadcasting System merged with Time Warner which, besides placing Turner Classic Movies and Warner Bros. Entertainment under the same corporate umbrella, also gave Turner Classic Movies access to Warner Bros.' library of films released after 1950 (which itself includes other acquired entities such as the Lorimar, Saul Zaentz and National General Pictures libraries); incidentally, Turner Classic Movies had already been running select Warner Bros. film titles through a licensing agreement with the studio that was signed prior to the launch of the channel.\nIn the early 2000s, AMC abandoned its commercial-free format, which led to Turner Classic Movies being the only movie-oriented basic cable channel to devote its programming entirely to classic films without commercial interruption or content editing. By 2002, AMC had broadened its film content to feature colorized and more recent films.\n\nTCM Movie Database (2006\u20132019)\nLaunched in 2006, Turner Classic Movies maintains its own comprehensive database of actors, actresses, and film crew (listing more than 1.25 million people, with 15,000 written biographies), and motion picture titles (more than 130,000 titles), not limited to the film libraries that Turner Classic Movies owns, and it includes links by which a user can request that Turner Classic Movies schedule any title for viewing. TCM Movie Database has lost some functionality. The portal page is now unavailable, yet database entries are still available and function.  Richard B. Steiner was the creator, architect, and supervisor of TCM Movie Database. By 2013, the Watch TCM app for iOS, Android, and Blackberry had some TCM Movie Database information. Leonard Maltin's reviews appear in the TCM Movie Database.\n\nCorporate restructuring (2019\u2013present)\nOn March 4, 2019, Time Warner's new owner AT&T (who renamed the company WarnerMedia) announced a planned reorganization to effectively dissolve the Turner Broadcasting System division, which involved Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, Turner Classic Movies, and digital media company Otter Media being transferred directly under Warner Bros. Entertainment. Aside from Otter, which was transferred to WarnerMedia Entertainment on May 31, 2019 to oversee development of HBO Max, the newly transferred properties came under a newly formed division, Warner Bros. Global Kids, Young Adults and Classics.\nOn September 1, 2021, Turner Classic Movies introduced a new logo and slogan, \"Where Then Meets Now\", in the network's first major rebranding since its launch. The rebranding was intended to give Turner Classic Movies a more modern and energetic presentation while continuing to emphasize its commitment to showcasing classic cinema; new branding elements include Technicolor-inspired color schemes, and a new stylized \"C\" in its wordmark, which resembles a camera lens and symbolizes themes of \"curation\", \"context\", \"culture\" and \"connection\".\nIn March 2023, it was announced that TCM was marking the centennial of Warner Bros., in conjunction with The Film Foundation and the TCM Classic Film Festival. This included special airings of newly-restored Warner Bros. films: Rio Bravo (introduced by Martin Scorsese), and East of Eden (introduced by Wes Anderson and Joanna Hogg).\nOn June 20, 2023, multiple TCM executives (including executive vice president Pola Changnon, who had been with Turner for over 25 years) were released by the channel's current owner, Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), as part of layoffs affecting its U.S. Networks division. The network was to be moved under the oversight of Cartoon Network head Michael Ouweleen, and it was reported that there were plans for more synergies and cross-promotion of TCM with the rest of the networks group. The layoffs led to concerns over the future of the channel, with filmmakers Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, and Paul Thomas Anderson holding a meeting with WBD CEO David Zaslav to discuss them. They later issued a joint statement, explaining that the channel has been a \"precious resource of cinema, open 24 hours a day seven days a week\", and had \"always been a profitable endeavor\".\nOn June 23, 2023, WBD appointed the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group's CEOs Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy as heads of the network, reporting to head of U.S. Networks Kathleen Finch. The pair stated that \"We have each spent time talking to Zaslav, separately and together, and it's clear that TCM and classic cinema are very important to him. Our primary aim is to ensure that TCM's programming is untouched and protected.\" On June 28, it was announced that Scorsese, Spielberg, and Anderson would actively collaborate with De Luca and Abdy on the network's direction; a spokesperson stated that \"TCM is not immune to the very real pressure on the entire linear ecosystem, but we have taken steps to ensure that we stay true to the mission of the network \u2014 bringing more titles to the air, driving content investment, and preserving and protecting the culture of cinema.\"\n\nProgramming\nTurner Classic Movies essentially operates as a commercial-free service, with breaks between films usually consisting of promos for its programming, advertising for the network's events and merchandising, and interstitial segments profiling classic film actors and actresses. In addition to this, extended breaks between features are filled with theatrically released movie trailers and classic short subjects \u2013 from series such as The Passing Parade, Crime Does Not Pay, Pete Smith Specialties, and Robert Benchley \u2013 under the banner name TCM Extras (formerly One Reel Wonders). In 2007, some of the short films featured on Turner Classic Movies were made available for streaming on Turner Classic Movies's website. Partly to allow these interstitials, Turner Classic Movies schedules its feature films either at the top of the hour or at :15, :30 or :45 minutes past the hour, instead of in timeslots of varying five-minute increments.\nTurner Classic Movies' film content has remained mostly uncut and uncolorized (with films natively filmed or post-produced in the format being those only ones presented in color), depending upon the original content of movies, particularly movies released after the 1968 implementation of the Motion Picture Association of America's ratings system and the concurrent disestablishment of the Motion Picture Production Code. Because of this, Turner Classic Movies is formatted similarly to a premium channel with certain films \u2013 particularly those made from the 1960s onward \u2013 sometimes featuring nudity, sexual content, violence and\/or strong profanity; the network also features rating bumpers prior to the start of a program (most programs on Turner Classic Movies, especially films, are rated for content using the TV Parental Guidelines, in lieu of the MPAA's rating system).\nThe network's programming season runs from March of one year until the following February of the next when a retrospective of Oscar-winning and Oscar-nominated movies is shown, called 31 Days of Oscar. As a result of its devoted format to classic feature films, viewers who are interested in tracing the career development of actresses such as Barbara Stanwyck or Greta Garbo or actors like Cary Grant or Humphrey Bogart have the unique opportunity to see most of the films that were made during their careers, from beginning to end. Turner Classic Movies presents many of its features in their original aspect ratio (widescreen or full screen) whenever possible \u2013 widescreen films broadcast on Turner Classic Movies are letterboxed on the network's standard definition feed. Turner Classic Movies also regularly presents widescreen presentations of films not available in the format on any home video release.\nOccasionally, Turner Classic Movies shows restored versions of films, particularly old silent films with newly commissioned musical soundtracks. Turner Classic Movies is also a major backer of the Descriptive Video Service (created by Boston PBS member station WGBH-TV), with many of the films aired on the network offering visual description for the blind and visually impaired, which is accessible through the second audio program option through most television sets, or a cable or satellite receiver.\nDuring the prime time hours, an ident for the \"Watch TCM\" app is shown after every movie.\nCertain titles on Turner Classic Movies are not available to streaming services, due to restrictions through this service platform. During these scheduled times, the movie title is blocked from airing and a visual notice is provided to the viewer.\n\nNow Playing\nTurner Classic Movies formerly published Now Playing, a monthly program guide, originally available through a standalone subscription, which provided daily listings and descriptions for films scheduled to air on Turner Classic Movies in the coming month. The digest-size magazine highlighted a featured actor on the cover, and featured essays about the \"guest programmer\" as well as a movie-and-actor themed crossword puzzle. The May 2017 issue, following the death in March 2017 of host Robert Osborne, contained \"Remembering Robert Osborne\" by Ben Mankiewicz.\nTurner Classic Movies ceased print publication of Now Playing (which had been one of the few channel-specific program guides that remained in print circulation for most of the 2000s and 2010s) with the August 2017 issue, moving it to an electronic format available via email free of charge.\n\nMovie library\nTurner Classic Movies' library of films spans several decades of cinema and includes thousands of film titles. Before its launch in April 1994, Turner's film library had included pre-1986 MGM and RKO films, as well as all pre-1948 Warner Bros. films. In August 1993, TCM obtained exclusive rights to 300 films from Paramount Pictures, for a cost of $30 million. In August 1996, TCM obtained an exclusive, three-year licensing deal to 36 films from Sony Pictures Entertainment (primarily film content from Columbia Pictures and TriStar Pictures).\nIn April 2004, near their 10th anniversary, TCM purchased the television licensing rights to 146 titles from Universal Pictures and Columbia Pictures. In August of the same year, 20th Century Fox agreed to license several classic film titles from their library. In 2014, Walt Disney Studios agreed to license titles from their library, including episodes from their anthology television series. These were aired during their Treasures From the Disney Vault programming block, hosted by film historian Leonard Maltin. \nTurner Classic Movies includes movies in the public domain, mostly from the 1900s to 1920s. Although most movies shown are from the 1930s through the 1970s, the channel sometimes shows newer movies.\n\nHosted and special programming\nRegular features\nMost feature movies shown during the prime time and early overnight hours (8:00 p.m. to 2:30 a.m. Eastern Time) were presented by film historian Robert Osborne. He was the network's first host since its 1994 launch until 2016, except for a five-month medical leave from July to December 2011, when guest hosts presented each night's films. In September 2003, Ben Mankiewicz was hired as the network's daytime weekend host. In October 2012, Osborne announced he was delegating his on-air appearances over to Mankiewicz, who assumed primetime hosting duties on Fridays by the next year. Osborne nevertheless continued hosting the Private Screenings and The Essentials series.\nIn January 2014, during his \"Noir City\" film festival in San Francisco, Eddie Muller announced he had been hired as an on-air host for the network. In May 2016, Tiffany Vasquez, a graduate of NYU Tisch School of the Arts, became the network's first female host, introducing films on Saturday afternoons. She had previously won TCM's 20th Anniversary Ultimate Fan Contest, flying to Atlanta to introduce a film of her choice on-air with Robert Osborne. In January 2018, Vasquez announced on Twitter she had taped her last introductions and her contract was not renewed. That same year, Dave Karger and Alicia Malone were jointly announced as full-time hosts for the network. In September 2019, Jacqueline Stewart was hired and became the network's first African-American host.\n\nStar of the Month\nTurner Classic Movies regularly airs a Star of the Month throughout the year in which most, if not all, feature films from a film star are shown during that night's schedule. August is the only month to not have a Star of the Month due to Summer Under the Stars.\n\nSilent Sunday Nights\nSilent Sunday Nights  is a weekend late-night programming block showcasing silent cinema broadcasting on Sunday midnights Eastern Time. In 2013, Ben Mankiewicz began hosting the block. In September 2019, Jacqueline Stewart became the current host. In September 2021, Sibling Rivalry, a New York City-based independent creative agency, designed the latest bumper intro for the block.\n\nTCM Imports\nTCM Imports is a weekend late-night programming block showcasing international cinema. Originally broadcast on Friday nights at 2 a.m. Eastern Time, the block was moved to late Saturday nights. It currently airs on Sunday nights at 2 a.m. Eastern Time. In 2013, Mankiewicz began hosting the block. In March 2019, Alicia Malone became the current host.\nThe first bumper intro was designed by the animation studio Cuppa Coffee Studios, which featured several stop-motion animated men rolling a giant globe brandishing the programming logo. During the 2010s, the logo design studio Hool & Co. designed a new bumper featuring a customary countdown meant to highlight several international film movements. In September 2021, Sibling Rivalry designed the latest bumper.\n\nNoir Alley\nDuring its early years, TCM devoted a programming block to the film noir genre titled Darkness After Dawn. In March 2017, the program was rebranded as Noir Alley, hosted by Eddie Muller. The Maltese Falcon (1941) was its first broadcast. It broadcasts on Saturday nights and repeats on Sunday mornings at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.  \nIn January 2013, Muller had previously hosted a four-film marathon block titled \"Night in Noir City\". In June of the same year, he was invited back to host their \"Friday Night Spotlight,\" showcasing 16 noir films with adapted stories by crime fiction writers, including Dashiell Hammett and James M. Cain. He was invited back again for the Summer of Darkness retrospective in 2015, which proved popular with viewers.\n\nMusical Matinee\nIn October 2022, TCM announced their latest programming block titled Musical Matinee broadcasting musical films, primarily from the Golden Age of Hollywood. The program is hosted by Dave Karger and broadcasts on Saturday afternoons Eastern Time. Singin' in the Rain (1952) was the block's first film broadcast on November 5, 2022.\n\nTCM Guest Programmer\nTCM features a monthly programming block called the TCM Guest Programmer, in which one of the hosts is joined by a celebrity guest responsible for choosing that evening's films (examples of such programmers during 2012 include Jules Feiffer, Anthony Bourdain, Debra Winger, Ellen Barkin, Spike Lee, Regis Philbin and Jim Lehrer). Since 2023, the TCM Guest Programmer block has appeared sporadically, with appearances from Martin Scorsese (during his promotional tour of his 2023 film Killers of the Flower Moon), Noah Baumbach, George Miller (during his promotional tour of his 2024 film Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga), Kevin Costner (during his promotional tour of his 2024 film Horizon: An American Saga \u2013 Chapter 1), and Ryan Reynolds (during his promotional tour of his 2024 film Deadpool & Wolverine).\n\nSeasonal blocks\nTurner Classic Movies suspends its regular schedule twice each year for a special month of film marathons. 31 Days of Oscar is a programming block airing each Oscar season on the network during the month of the Academy Awards. Each feature that TCM airs in this block can be either an Oscar winner or nominee. Each August, TCM airs Summer Under the Stars, featuring an entire daily schedule devoted to the filmographies of a particular actor, with programming pertaining to the star of the day.\n\nDefunct programming blocks\nIn the summer of 2007, the channel debuted Funday Night at the Movies, a block hosted by actor Tom Kenny (best known as the voice of SpongeBob SquarePants). This summer block featured classic feature films (such as The Wizard of Oz, Sounder, Bringing Up Baby, Singin' in the Rain, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, The Adventures of Robin Hood, and 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea) aimed at introducing these movies to new generations of children, and their families. \nIn 2008, Funday Night at the Movies was replaced by Essentials Jr., a youth-oriented version of its weekly series, The Essentials (originally hosted by actors Abigail Breslin, and Chris O'Donnell, then by John Lithgow from 2009 to 2011, and then by Bill Hader, starting with the 2011 season), which included such family-themed films as National Velvet, Captains Courageous, and Yours, Mine and Ours, as well as more eclectic selections, such as Sherlock Jr., The Music Box, Harvey, Mutiny on the Bounty, and The Man Who Knew Too Much.\nIn 2014, the channel debuted Treasures from the Disney Vault, hosted by Leonard Maltin. This block showcased a compilation of vintage Disney feature films, cartoons, documentaries, episodes of Disney's anthology television series, and episodes of The Mickey Mouse Club. The last scheduled Treasures from the Disney Vault aired on September 2, 2019 due to the launch of Disney+ in November of that year.\nTCM Underground debuted in October 2006 as a Saturday late night block which focused on cult film. The block was originally hosted by rocker\/filmmaker Rob Zombie until December 2006; as of 2014, it was the only regular film presentation block on the channel that did not have a host. TCM Underground was discontinued in February 2023 after its programmer, Millie De Chirico, was laid off from the network.\n\nDocumentaries\nIn addition to films, Turner Classic Movies also airs original content, mostly documentaries about classic movie personalities, the world of filmmaking and particularly notable films. An occasional month-long series, Race and Hollywood, showcases films by and about people of non-white races, featuring discussions of how these pictures influenced white people's image of said races, as well as how people of those races viewed themselves. Previous installments have included \"Asian Images on Film\" in 2008, \"Native American Images on Film\" in 2010, \"Black Images on Film\" in 2006 \"Latino Images on Film\" in 2009 and \"Arab Images on Film\" in 2011. The network aired the film series Screened Out (which explored the history and depiction of homosexuality in film) in 2007 and Religion on Film (focusing on the role of religion in cinematic works) in 2005. In 2011, TCM debuted a new series entitled AFI's Master Class: The Art of Collaboration.\n\nTCM Remembers\nMany films shown on Turner Classic Movies were made during the Golden Age of Hollywood, an era with few survivors. In December 1994, Turner Classic Movies debuted \"TCM Remembers\", a tribute to recently deceased film personalities (including actors, producers, composers, directors, writers, and cinematographers) which occasionally airs during promotional breaks between films. The segments appear in two forms: individual tributes and a longer end-of-year compilation. Following the recent death of an especially famous film personality (usually an actor or filmmaker), the segment will feature a montage of select shots of the deceased's work.\nEvery December, a more inclusive TCM Remembers interstitial is produced, featuring a selection of clips interspersed with scenes from settings such as an abandoned drive-in (2012) or a theatre which is closing down (2013). Since 2001, most of the soundtracks for these have been introspective melodies by indie artists such as Badly Drawn Boy (2007) or Steve Earle (2009). 2015's song, \"Quickly Now\", was written especially for TCM Remembers by Chuck Moore and Reid Hall, and sung by Eryn McHugh.\n\nTCM Remembers soundtracks\nAccolades\nTurner Classic Movies received a 2008 Peabody Award for its dedication to film preservation and \"a continuing, powerful commitment to a central concept\u2014the place of film in social and cultural experience\".\nTurner Classic Movies received a 2013 Peabody Award for its presentation of Mark Cousins' The Story of Film: An Odyssey, a 15-episode documentary about the development and advancement of the medium of motion pictures. Drawing on its exhaustive film library, Turner Classic Movies complemented each episode with short films and feature films from the familiar to the little-seen. The Peabody Award praised Turner Classic Movies's The Story of Film \"for its inclusive, uniquely annotated survey of world cinema history\".\n\nStreaming\nIn April 2016, TCM announced it had partnered with The Criterion Collection to create a subscription streaming service called FilmStruck. The service included a curated selection of more than 1,000 classic Hollywood, international, arthouse and independent films, including those from the Janus Films and Kino libraries. FilmStruck was launched on November 1, 2016, and included exclusive bonus content such as hosted introductions, interviews and rare media. In November 2018, FilmStruck was shut down by WarnerMedia, under the ownership of AT&T, to streamline business operations.\nSince its 2020 launch, TCM has been associated with its parent company Warner Bros. Discovery's Max streaming service. TCM has its own category hub on the service with a curated selection of classic films.\n\nMerchandising and events\nTCM Vault Collection\nThe TCM Vault Collection consists of several different DVD collections of rare classic films that have been licensed, remastered and released by Turner Classic Movies (through corporate sister Warner Bros. Home Entertainment). These boxed set releases are of films by notable actors, directors or studios that were previously unreleased on DVD or VHS. The sets often include bonus discs including documentaries and shorts from the Turner Classic Movies library. The initial batch of DVDs are printed in limited quantities and subsequent batches are made-on-demand (MOD).\n\nUniversal Collection \u2013 Featuring films licensed by Turner Classic Movies from the Universal Pictures vault.\nThe Lost RKO Collection \u2013 Featuring RKO films from the 1930s.\nTCM Spotlight \u2013 A series of DVD box sets released by Warner Home Video featuring Charlie Chan and stars such as Esther Williams, Errol Flynn, Jean Arthur, Deanna Durbin, and Doris Day.\n\nTCM Wine Club\nIn October 2015, Turner Classic Movies announced the launch of the TCM Wine Club, in which they teamed up with Laithwaite to provide a line of mail-order wines from famous vineyards such as famed writer-director-producer Francis Ford Coppola's winery.  Wines are available in 3-month subscriptions and can be selected as reds, whites, or a mixture of both.  From the wines chosen, Turner Classic Movies also includes recommended movies to watch with each, such as a \"True Grit\" wine, to be paired with the John Wayne film of the same name.\n\nTCM Young Composers Film Competition\nIn 2000, Turner Classic Movies started an annual Young Composers Film Competition, inviting aspiring composers to participate in a judged competition that offers the winner of each year's competition the opportunity to score a restored, feature-length silent film as a grand prize, mentored by a well-known composer, with the new work subsequently premiering on the network. As of 2006, films that have been rescored include the 1921 Rudolph Valentino film Camille, two Lon Chaney films: 1921's The Ace of Hearts and 1928's Laugh, Clown, Laugh, and Greta Garbo's 1926 film The Temptress.\n\nTCM Classic Film Festival\nIn April 2010, Turner Classic Movies launched their first Classic Film Festival, an event\u2014now held annually\u2014at the Grauman's Chinese Theater and the Grauman's Egyptian Theater on Hollywood Boulevard. The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel serves as the festival's key venue for special events. Initially hosted by Robert Osborne, the four-day long annual festival features celebrity appearances, special events, and screenings of around 50 classic films, including several newly-restored films by The Film Foundation, an organization devoted to preserving Hollywood's classic film legacy. \nThe Classic Film Festival was cancelled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and was moved to a virtual setting, billed as the \"Special Home Edition\". In 2021, the festival was cancelled again as a live event, and continued its virtual setting. In 2022, the festival returned to its live setting, with its theme being \"All Together Now: Back to the Big Screen.\" A year later, the festival celebrated the centennial anniversary of Warner Bros. launching with the premiere of a newly-restored edition of Rio Bravo (1959).\n\nTCM Classic Cruise\nIn 2011, TCM launched its inaugural Classic Cruise event, first aboard the Celebrity Millennium cruise ship traveling from Miami to Key West and Cozumel. In 2013, the Classic Cruise held its maiden voyage aboard the Disney Magic for the first time. In 2016, the cruise instead used the Disney Fantasy, which holds 4,000 passengers compared to the Magic's 2,700-passenger accommodation. In 2019, the Classic Cruise returned from a three-year absence aboard the Disney Magic, sailing from New York to Bermuda.\n\nInternational versions\nTurner Classic Movies is available in many other countries around the world. In Canada, Turner Classic Movies began to be carried on Shaw Cable and satellite provider Shaw Direct in 2005. Rogers Cable started offering Turner Classic Movies in December 2006 as a free preview for subscribers of its digital cable tier, and was added to its analogue tier in February 2007. While the schedule for the Canadian feed is generally the same as that of the U.S. network, some films are replaced for broadcast in Canada due to rights issues and other reasons. Other versions of Turner Classic Movies are available in France, Greece, Canada, Spain, Middle East, Africa, Asia, Latin America, Nordic countries, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malta. The UK version operated two channels, including a defunct spinoff called Turner Classic Movies 2.

The film stars Hideko Takamine as a young schoolteacher who lives during the rise and fall of Japanese nationalism in the early Sh\u014dwa period, and has been noted for its anti-war theme.\nTwenty-Four Eyes was released in Japan by Shochiku on 15 September 1954, where it received generally positive reviews and was a commercial success. It received numerous awards, including the Blue Ribbon Award, the Mainichi Film Award and the Kinema Junpo Award for Best Film of 1954, and the Golden Globe Award.\n\nPlot\nOn 4 April 1928, young schoolteacher Hisako \u014cishi arrives on the island of Sh\u014ddoshima to teach a class of first grade students from the nearby village. \u014cishi is introduced to her class of twelve students: Isokichi, Takeichi, Kichiji, Tadashi, Nita, Matsue, Misako, Masuno, Fujiko, Sanae, Kotoe, and Kotsuru. Because her surname \u014cishi (\u5927\u77f3) can be translated as \"Big Stone\", but she is shorter in stature than her predecessor, the children address her as \"Miss Pebble\" (\u5c0f\u77f3, Koishi). She teaches the children how to sing songs, and plays outside with them. Most of the children have to care for younger siblings or help their parents with farming or fishing after school. Because \u014cishi rides a bicycle and wears a Western suit, the adult villagers are initially apprehensive towards her.\nOn 1 September, the class goes to the seashore, where some of the students play a practical joke on \u014cishi by causing her to fall into a hole in the sand. The fall injures one of her legs, and she takes a leave of absence. A substitute teacher takes her place, but the children are not as receptive to him as they were to \u014cishi. One day after lunch, the students sneak away from their homes and journey on foot to go visit \u014cishi. They spot her riding in a bus, and she invites them to her house, where they have a large meal; later, the children's parents send \u014cishi gifts as thanks for treating them. Because of her injury, \u014cishi is transferred from the schoolhouse to the main school, where teachers instruct students in fifth grade and above.\nBy 1933, \u014cishi is engaged to a ship engineer, and her original students are now sixth graders. Matsue's mother gives birth to another girl but dies in the process, leaving Matsue to care for the child. Soon after, the baby dies as well, and Matsue leaves Sh\u014ddoshima to live with relatives. \u014cishi learns that a fellow teacher, Mr. Kataoka, has been arrested on suspicion of being \"a Red\". Kataoka was suspected of having a copy of an anti-war anthology printed by a class taught by a friend of his in Onomichi. \u014cishi notes that she shared stories from that anthology with her own students after a copy was sent to the school. The principal burns the anthology and warns \u014cishi against discussing politics with her class.\nIn October, \u014cishi and her class take a field trip to Ritsurin Park in Takamatsu, as well as to the Konpira Shrine. \u014cishi goes into town and is sad to find Matsue working at a restaurant as a waitress. Back at school, \u014cishi has her students write down their hopes for the future; Sanae dreams of becoming a teacher, while Fujiko, whose family is impoverished, feels hopeless. Kotoe drops out of school to help her mother at home; Masuno wants to attend a conservatory, but her parents disapprove; the male students in the class want to become soldiers. \u014cishi is reprimanded by the principal for not encouraging the boys in their military aspirations. Some time later, \u014cishi, who is now pregnant, decides to resign from teaching.\nBy 1941, \u014cishi has given birth to three children: Daikichi, Namiki, and Yatsu. \u014cishi visits Kotoe, who has tuberculosis. Misako is now married, Sanae has become a teacher at the main school, Kotsuru is an honors graduate in midwifery, Fujiko's family went bankrupt, Kotsuru works at a caf\u00e9 in Kobe, Masuno works at her parents' restaurant, and the male students have all joined the military. Over time, \u014cishi's mother dies, and \u014cishi's husband is killed in battle.\nOn 15 August 1945, Emperor Hirohito announces the surrender of Japan at the end of World War II. \u014cishi's daughter Yatsu later dies after falling from a tree trying to pick persimmons.\nOn 4 April 1946, \u014cishi, now struggling financially, returns to teaching. Among the students in her new class are Makoto, the younger sister of Kotoe, who has died; Chisato, Matsue's daughter; and Katsuko, Misako's daughter. \u014cishi reunites with an adult Misako, and they visit the graves of Tadashi, Takeichi, and Nita, all of whom were killed during the war. Misako, Sanae, Kotsuru, and Masuno host a party for \u014cishi at Masuno's home. They are joined by Isokichi, who was blinded in the war, and Kichiji. The students present \u014cishi with a new bicycle to ride to school.\n\nCast\nHideko Takamine as Hisako \u014cishi\n\nThemes\nAmerican author David Desser wrote of the film that \"Kinoshita desires to make the basic decency of one woman [\u014cishi] stand in opposition to the entire militarist era in Japan.\" Japanese film theorist and historian Tadao Sato wrote that \"Twenty-Four Eyes evolved to represent Japanese regrets over the wars in China and the Pacific and stood in symbolic opposition to the impending return to militarism.\" Sato added that the film \"implies that the honest citizens of Japan were only victims of trauma and sorrow and fundamentally innocent of any culpability for the war. [...] Had the movie assigned responsibility for the war to all Japanese people, opposition would have arisen, and it might not have become such a box-office hit.\"\nFilm scholar Audie Bock referred to Twenty-Four Eyes as being \"undoubtedly a woman's film, honoring the endurance and self-sacrifice of mothers and daughters trying to preserve their families\", and called it \"a meticulously detailed portrait of what are perceived as the best qualities in the Japanese character: humility, perseverance, honesty, love of children, love of nature, and love of peace.\" Bock wrote that \"The resonance of Twenty-Four Eyes for audiences then and now is that Miss Oishi speaks for countless people the world over who never want to see another father, son, or brother die in a war for reasons they do not understand\", and posited that the film's anti-war message is \"aimed more directly at Japan\" compared to films with a similar message by Yasujir\u014d Ozu or Akira Kurosawa.\nIn an analysis of the film, Christopher Howard wrote: \"From a feminist perspective, there is certainly great sympathy with the young girls forced out of school and into menial work by their parents [...] As a pacifist and leftist sympathizer, however, Kinoshita raises stronger political questions in an episode in which Miss Oishi displays sympathy with a fellow teacher accused of communist connections.\" He notes that \"she even tries introducing some elements of Marxism into her class teaching. At a time in which the Japanese Teaching Union was the source of a great deal of radical activity, Twenty-Four Eyes is not the only film making the connection between teaching and left-wing thought, and a number of independent films from the period also had more sustained anti-military and communist sympathies.\"\n\nReception\nTwenty-Four Eyes was a popular film in Japan upon its release in 1954.\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 60% based on five reviews, with an average rating of 6.69\/10. In 2006, Alan Morrison of Empire gave the film a score of four out of five stars, calling it \"Sentimental but sincere.\" In 2008, Jamie S. Rich of DVD Talk praised the film's ensemble of child actors and its emotional weight, writing that \"If you don't tear up at least a couple of times in Twenty-Four Eyes, you apparently have rocks where the rest of us have brains and hearts.\" Rich called the film \"an effective lesson in how the hopes and dreams of our youngest citizens and the opportunities they are given to pursue them are essential to the survival of any society.\" Fernando F. Croche of Slant Magazine gave the film two-and-a-half out of four stars, calling it \"alternately endearing and overbearing to modern eyes and ears\" but \"reportedly a soothing experience\" for Japanese viewers still suffering from the effects of World War II when the film was released.\n\nAwards\nBlue Ribbon Award for Best Film and Best Screenplay\nMainichi Film Award for Best Film, Best Director and Best Screenplay\nKinema Junpo Award for Best Film\nGolden Globe Award for Best Foreign-Language Foreign Film\nHenrietta Award at the 5th Annual World Film Favorite Festival\nTwenty-Four Eyes ranked #6 on the 2009 All Time Best Japanese Movies list by readers of Kinema Junpo.\n\nHome media\nOn 20 February 2006, Twenty-Four Eyes was released on DVD in the United Kingdom by Eureka Entertainment, as part of their Masters of Cinema line of home video releases, containing an essay by film historian Joan Mellen.

It is based on Romain Rolland's novel Pierre et Luce. The film stars Eiji Okada in the role of Tajima Saburo opposite to Yoshiko Kuga as Ono Keiko.\n\nPlot Summary\nTajima Saburo is a pacifist and amateur poet in World War II era Japan - a trait which causes conflict between him and his family. His eldest brother, Ichiro, was killed in the war leaving behind his pregnant wife, Masako, who now lives with the Tajima family. His other older brother, Jiro, has already followed suit to join the war much to Saburo's dismay. This leaves Saburo the black sheep of the family as Jiro and his father show their disappointment at his lack of patriotism. During one fateful bomb drill, Saburo spots a woman in the shelter, Ono Keiko, and protects her from the sounds of shelling from outside. Their hands briefly touch during this moment, and Keiko is forever imprinted on Saburo's mind. Once the shelter is cleared, Saburo loses track of Keiko and decides to head home, defeated.\nAt home, Saburo attempts to avoid seeing Jiro and his father, resulting in him being berated for his filial disrespect. Fleeing upstairs to his bedroom to avoid further conflict, Jiro follows suit in the hopes he can convince Saburo to join the army voluntarily. His drunken attempts fail and more arguing ensues. The following morning Saburo meets with his school friends to discuss publishing a poetry book based on the posthumous works of their recently deceased acquaintance, Kawabe. It becomes Saburo's job to meet Kawabe's brother in Tokyo at Hakuyosha to discuss the details. There, Saburo approaches Hakuyosha and spots children playing as soldiers outside. Realizing the game they are playing, he begins to laugh and realizes none other than Keiko is nearby, laughing along with him. They recognize each other immediately. By coincidence, Keiko was helping out at the same business Kawabe's brother works at as an advertisement painter\/designer.\nTogether Saburo and Keiko sit by a small pond to discuss anything but the war, sharing caramel candies and an apple. Saburo is interested in Keiko's paintings, but she insists she only does it to earn a wage and that she doesn't actually feel as though she's good at it - though this doesn't seem to bother her, so long as she gets paid. They agree again to meet the next day and Saburo suggests they go to the nearby museum, but abruptly changes his mind, instead suggesting they look at her paintings together. In a shocking turn of events, Saburo admits he actually dislikes her illustrations to which she responds nonchalantly, claiming it only matters if the publishers buy it. It's during their conversation Saburo realizes Keiko is quite poor, having holes in her shoes and gloves. The topic of discussion becomes existential, as Keiko laments having to eat, wear clothes, and work in order to be human.\nSaburo joins Keiko on her search for publishing companies that will hire her, though most appear to be uninterested in her work. Finally, at Akatsuki Studio, the owner agrees to pay her for her poster - though he refers to it as amateurish - but he insists he will only pay her if she makes changes to it by the following morning and will only pay her at the end of the month. This enrages Saburo as he feels Keiko is being taken advantage of, but Keiko asks him to let it go for her sake. Once more they sit by the pond they reunited at and though they try to avoid discussing the war, Keiko insists Saburo tell her when he's going to be forcibly enlisted. He reveals that his enlistment is only six months away, and nearby, Jiro has spotted Saburo sitting with Keiko in the park. On the walk to the tram stop, Saburo offers to buy Keiko a new pair of gloves. Keiko refuses saying she does not take handouts. He agrees to this condition, saying he will buy them for her in exchange for a portrait painted by her. At first she thinks he's joking, but eventually agrees to meet him at 2 o'clock the following Tuesday to paint him at her home.\nLater, Jiro confronts Saburo in his room once more calling him irresponsible for involving Keiko in his life when he knows he\u2019ll be leaving soon to become a soldier. This argument shakes Saburo, and he arrives at Keiko's for the portrait painting with the understanding he must end their relationship. Once they take a break from painting, Saburo tells Keiko he cannot make her happy, and it is best for him to leave before he makes things worse for her. Keiko insists he\u2019s making the wrong decision and through her tears, Saburo realizes he has to make the most of their time together as either of them could die during the war. Before he leaves, he looks back at her through the window of her home, and kisses her through the glass.\nBack at home, tensions are high between his friends and only made worse when he receives news that Jiro has been struck by a supply train and is now on his deathbed. Jiro has sent for Saburo and their father, though only Saburo arrives. On his deathbed, Jiro reconciles with Saburo. He continues to see Keiko, but now finds himself living obliviously to the war. With naive confidence they both leave a bomb shelter too early and are narrowly missed by a nearby explosion, killing a man they had passed by earlier instead. They kiss for the first time in the corner they are huddled in, and Saburo asks her to marry him. Keiko agrees.\nThe call-outs have begun being sent to Saburo and his friends, and they drink together as well as bicker amongst each other in frustration. In the days following, Saburo arrives to let Keiko know he\u2019s received his call-up and he will be leaving in two days time. He tells her that they can get married when he returns, and they begin to imagine their married life together. The following day, Saburo is notified he\u2019s being mobilized that night instead of the following morning - and more than this his plans with Keiko have been interrupted by Masako collapsing in the street due to a miscarriage. He cannot leave Masako\u2019s side, as he promised Jiro he would take care of their family after he passed. Masako insists he go, as there is nothing to be done for her, but he refuses.\nAt the station, Keiko continues to wait for Saburo - sealing her fate as a bomb is dropped on the train station and kills her in the blast. That night, Saburo waits outside of Keiko\u2019s home in the hopes he can explain himself when she arrives - though she never does. He leaves behind a note of apology, hoping she will meet him at the train station as he leaves for the warfront. Instead, her mother receives the note but she does not make it to the train station in time. Saburo leaves for the war, never knowing that Keiko has perished. Much later, Keiko\u2019s mother and Saburo\u2019s father receive notice that Saburo has also perished on the warfront, and together they mourn the loss of their children over the portrait that Keiko painted of Saburo.\n\nCast\nYoshiko Kuga as Ono Keiko\nEiji Okada as Tajima Saburo\nOsamu Takizawa as Tajima Eisaku\nAkitake K\u014dno as Tajima Jiro\nAkiko Kazami as Masako\nHaruko Sugimura as Ono Suga\nHayashi Koichi as Saburo's friend\nHiroshi Akutagawa as Saburo's friend\nAkira \u014cizumi as Saburo's friend\nHiroshi Kond\u014d as Saburo's friend\nYoshie Minami as Mrs. Taketori\n\nAwards\nBlue Ribbon Awards\nBest Film\nBest Director: Tadashi Imai\nKinema Junpo Awards\nBest Film\nMainichi Film Awards\nBest Film\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nUntil We Meet Again at IMDb\n\"\u307e\u305f\u9022\u3046\u65e5\u307e\u3067 (Until We Meet Again)\" (in Japanese).

It was founded by Sime Silverman in New York City in 1905 as a weekly newspaper reporting on theater and vaudeville. In 1933, Daily Variety was launched, based in Los Angeles, to cover the motion-picture industry. Variety's website features entertainment news, reviews, box office results, plus a credits database, production charts and film calendar.\n\nHistory\nFounding\nVariety has been published since December 16, 1905, when it was launched by Sime Silverman as a weekly periodical covering theater and vaudeville, with its headquarters in New York City. Silverman had been fired by The Morning Telegraph in 1905 for panning an act which had taken out an advert for $50. He subsequently decided to start his own publication that, he said, would \"not be influenced by advertising.\" With a loan of $1,500 from his father-in-law, he launched Variety as publisher and editor. In addition to The Morning Telegraph, other major competitors at the time of the company's launch were The New York Clipper and the New York Dramatic Mirror.\nThe original cover design, which is very similar to the current design, was sketched by Edgar M. Miller, a scenic painter, who refused payment. The front cover contained pictures of the original editorial staff: Alfred Greason, Epes W. Sargeant (Chicot or Chic), Joshua Lowe, and Silverman. The first issue contained a review by Silverman's son Sidne, also known as Skigie (based on the childish lisping of his name) who was claimed to be the youngest critic in the world at seven years old.\n\n20th century\nIn 1922, Silverman acquired The New York Clipper which had been reporting on the stage and other entertainment since 1853, in an attempt to attract advertising revenue away from Billboard, following a dispute with William Donaldson, the owner of Billboard. Silverman folded it two years later after spending $100,000, merging some of its features into Variety. The same year, he launched the Times Square Daily, which he referred to as \"the world's worst daily\" and soon scrapped. During that period, Variety staffers worked on all three papers.\nAfter the launch of The Hollywood Reporter in 1930, Silverman launched the Hollywood-based Daily Variety in 1933 with Arthur Ungar as the editor. It replaced the Variety Bulletin issued in Hollywood on Fridays as a four-page wraparound to the Weekly. Daily Variety was initially published every day other than Sunday but mostly on Monday to Friday. The Daily and the Weekly were initially run as virtually independent newspapers, with the Daily concentrating mostly on Hollywood news and the Weekly on U.S. and international coverage.\nSilverman passed on the editorship of the Weekly Variety to Abel Green as his replacement in 1933. He remained as publisher until his death later that year, soon after launching Daily Variety. Silverman's son Sidne succeeded him as publisher of both publications but upon contracting tuberculosis in 1936 he could no longer take a day-to-day role at the paper. Green, the editor, and Harold Erichs, the treasurer and chief financial officer, ran the paper during his illness. Following Sidne's death in 1950, his only son Syd Silverman, was the sole heir to what was then Variety Inc. Young Syd's legal guardian Erichs, who had started at Variety as an office boy, assumed the presidency.\nUngar remained editor of Daily Variety until his death in 1950.\nHe was followed by Joe Schoenfeld.\nIn 1953, Army Archerd took over the \"Just for Variety\" column on page two of Daily Variety and swiftly became popular in Hollywood. Archerd broke countless exclusive stories, reporting from film sets, announcing pending deals, and giving news of star-related hospitalizations, marriages, and births. The column appeared daily for 52 years until September 1, 2005.\nErichs continued to oversee Variety until 1956. After that date, Syd Silverman managed the company as publisher of both the Weekly Variety in New York and the Daily Variety in Hollywood.\nThomas M. Pryor, former Hollywood bureau chief of The New York Times, became editor of Daily Variety in 1959. Under Pryor, Daily Variety expanded from 8 pages to 32 pages and also saw circulation increase from 8,000 to 22,000.\nGreen remained editor of Variety until he died in 1973, with Syd taking over.\nIn 1987, Variety was sold to Cahners Publishing for $64 million. In December 1987, Syd handed over editorship of Variety to Roger Watkins. After 29 years as editor of Daily Variety, Tom Pryor handed over to his son Pete in June 1988.\nOn December 7, 1988, Watkins proposed and oversaw the transition to four-color print. Upon its launch, the new-look Variety measured one inch shorter with a washed-out color on the front. The old front-page box advertisement was replaced by a strip advertisement, along with the first photos published in Variety since Sime gave up using them in the old format in 1920: they depicted Sime, Abel, and Syd.\nFor 20 years from 1989, Variety's editor-in-chief was Peter Bart, originally only of the weekly New York edition, with Michael Silverman (Syd's son) running the Daily in Hollywood. Bart had worked previously at Paramount Pictures and The New York Times.\nSyd remained as publisher until 1990 when he was succeeded on Weekly Variety by Gerard A. Byrne and on Daily Variety by Sime Silverman's great-grandson, Michael Silverman. Syd became chairman of both publications.\n\n21st century\nIn April 2009, Bart moved to the position of \"vice president and editorial director\", characterized online as \"Boffo No More: Bart Up and Out at Variety\". From mid 2009 to 2013, Timothy M. Gray oversaw the publication as Editor-in-Chief, after over 30 years of various reporter and editor positions in the newsroom.\n\nAcquisition by Penske Media Corporation\nIn October 2012, Reed Business Information, the periodical's owner, (formerly known as Reed-Elsevier, which had been parent to Cahner's Corp. in the United States) sold the publication to Penske Media Corporation (PMC). PMC is the owner of Deadline Hollywood, which since the 2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike has been considered Variety's largest competitor in online showbiz news. In October 2012, Jay Penske, chairman and CEO of PMC, announced that the website's paywall would come down, the print publication would stay, and he would invest more into Variety's digital platform in a townhall.\nIn March 2013, owner Penske appointed three co-editors to oversee different parts of the publication's industry coverage; Claudia Eller as Editor, Film; Cynthia Littleton as Editor, TV; and Andrew Wallenstein as Editor, Digital. The decision was also made to stop printing Daily Variety with the last printed edition published on March 19, 2013, with the headline \"Variety Ankles Daily Pub Hubbub\".\nIn June 2014, Variety launched a high-end real-estate breaking news site, Dirt, under the direction of self-proclaimed \"Real Estalker\" Mark David, which later expanded to its own stand-alone site in 2019. October 2014 Eller and Wallenstein were upped to Co-Editors in Chief, with Littleton continuing to oversee the trade's television coverage. In June 2014, Penske Media Corporation entered into an agreement with Reuters to syndicate news from Variety and Variety Latino-Powered by Univision to distribute leading entertainment news to the international news agency's global readership. This dissemination comes in the form of columns, news stories, images, video, and data-focused products. In July 2015, Variety was awarded a Los Angeles Area Emmy Award by the Television Academy in the Best Entertainment Program category for Variety Studio: Actors on Actors, a series of one-hour specials that take viewers inside Hollywood films and television programs through conversations with acclaimed actors. A second Los Angeles Area Emmy Award was awarded in 2016.\nIn June 2019, Variety shut down its Gaming section.\nA significant portion of the publication's advertising revenue comes during the film-award season leading up to the Academy Awards. During this \"Awards Season\", large numbers of colorful, full-page \"For Your Consideration\" advertisements inflate the size of Variety to double or triple its usual page count. These advertisements are the studios' attempt to reach other Hollywood professionals who will be voting on the many awards given out in the early part of the year, including the Academy Awards, the Golden Globes and various guild award honors.\n\nEditions\nVariety (first edition published December 16, 1905) is a  weekly entertainment publication with a broad coverage of movies, television, theater, music and technology, written for entertainment executives.  It is the only remaining Variety print publication and is published weekly and delivered internationally.\nDaily Variety (first edition published September 6, 1933 and last published March 19, 2013) was the Los Angeles\u2013based Hollywood and Broadway daily edition. The Daily Variety brand was revived in 2019 as a Mon\u2013Fri email newsletter presenting the top stories of the last 24 hours. Top stories are also posted on the Daily Variety page of Variety.com. Daily Variety Gotham, (started in 1998) was the name of the New York City\u2013based edition which gave a priority focus to East Coast show-business news and was produced earlier in the evening than the Los Angeles edition so it could be delivered to New York the following morning.\nVariety.com (launched in 1998) is the Internet version of Variety. It was one of the first online newspapers to charge for access when it launched. In June 2010, all content on the website became paywalled. The paywall was removed in April 2013, but access to additional content, such as the archives, requires subscription. Variety is also available as a mobile app as Variety On-The-Go.\nVariety Hitmakers (first edition published in November 2017) is the publication's first music franchise. The annual list recognizes the writers, producers, publishers, and other key personnel behind the scenes \"who helped make\u2015and break\u2015the most consumed songs of the year as compiled by BuzzAngle Music\". Kendrick Lamar, DJ Khaled, and Scooter Braun featured on three individual covers of the premiere print issues, with Lamar named Hitmaker of the Year. He, along with Khaled and Hailee Steinfeld, was honored at the inaugural Hitmakers awards ceremony held later that same month\u2014the event has continued annually since. Other honorees have included Dua Lipa and Bebe Rexha as 2018's Breakthrough Artist and Songwriter of the Year respectively, BTS (2019 Group of the Year), and Harry Styles (2020 Hitmaker of the Year).\nOn December 15, 1906, Variety published its first anniversary number that contained 64 pages, double the size of a regular edition. It published regular bumper anniversary editions each year, most often at the beginning of January, normally with a review of the year and other charts and data, including, from 1938 onwards, lists of the top performing films of the year and, from 1949, the annually updated all-time rental chart.  The editions also contained many advertisements from show business personalities and companies.  The 100th anniversary edition was published in October 2005 listing Variety's icons of the century. Along with the large anniversary editions, Variety also published special editions containing lots of additional information, charts and data (and advertising) for three film festivals: Cannes Film Festival, MIFED Film Market, and American Film Market Daily Variety also published an anniversary issue each October.  This regularly contained a day-by-day review of the year in show business and in the 1970s started to contain republication of the film reviews published during the year.\nOlder back issues of Variety are available on microfilm. In 2010, Variety.com allowed access to digitized versions of all issues of Variety and Daily Variety with a subscription. Certain articles and reviews prior to 1998 have been republished on Variety.com. The Media History Digital Library has scans of the archive of Variety from 1905 to 1963 available online.\n\nCirculation\nThe first issue of Variety sold 320 copies in 1905.\nPaid circulation for the weekly Variety magazine in 2023 was 85,300. Each copy of each Variety issue is read by an average of three people, with an estimated total readership of 255,900. Variety.com has 32 million unique monthly visitors.\n\nCulture\nFor much of its existence, Variety's writers and columnists have used a jargon called slanguage or Varietyese (a form of headlinese) that refers especially to the movie industry, and has largely been adopted and imitated by other writers in the industry. The language initially reflected that spoken by the actors during the early days of the newspaper.\nSuch terms as \"boffo\", \"payola\", and \"striptease\"  are attributed to the magazine.\nIn 1934, founder Sime Silverman headed a list in Time magazine of the \"ten modern Americans who have done most to keep American jargon alive\".\nAccording to The Boston Globe, the Oxford English Dictionary cites Variety as the earliest source for about two dozen terms, including \"show biz\" (1945). In 2005, Welcome Books published The Hollywood Dictionary by Timothy M. Gray and J. C. Suares, which defines nearly 200 of these terms.\nOne of its popular headlines was during the Wall Street Crash of 1929: \"Wall St. Lays An Egg\". The most famous was \"Sticks Nix Hick Pix\" (the movie-prop version renders it as \"Stix nix hix pix!\" in Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942), Michael Curtiz's musical\u2013biographical film about George M. Cohan starring James Cagney).\nIn 2012, Rizzoli Books published Variety: An Illustrated History of the World from the Most Important Magazine in Hollywood by Gray. The book covers Variety's coverage of hundreds of world events, from the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, through Arab Spring in 2012, and argues that the entertainment industry needs to stay aware of changes in politics and tastes since those changes will affect their audiences. In a foreword to the book, Martin Scorsese calls Variety \"the single most formidable trade publication ever\" and says that the book's content \"makes you feel not only like a witness to history, but part of it too.\"\nIn 2013, Variety staffers tallied more than 200 uses of weekly or Daily Variety in TV shows and films, ranging from I Love Lucy to Entourage.\nIn 2016, Variety endorsed Hillary Clinton for President of the United States, marking the first time the publication endorsed a candidate for elected office in its 111-year history.\n\nOffice locations\nVariety's first offices were in the Knickerbocker Theatre located at 1396 Broadway on 38th and Broadway in New York. Later it moved to 1536 Broadway at the 45th and Broadway corner until Loew's acquired the site to build the Loew's State Theatre. In 1909, Variety set up its first overseas office in London.\nIn 1920, Sime Silverman purchased an old brownstone building around the corner at 154 West 46th Street in New York, which became the Variety headquarters until 1987, when the publication was purchased. Under the new management of Cahners Publishing, the New York headquarters of the Weekly Variety was relocated to the corner of 32nd Street and Park Avenue South. Five years later, it was downgraded to a section of one floor in a building housing other Cahner's publications on West 18th Street, until the majority of operations were moved to Los Angeles.\nWhen Daily Variety started in 1933, its offices were in various buildings near Hollywood Blvd. and Sunset Blvd. In 1972, Syd Silverman purchased a building at 1400 North Cahuenga Blvd. which housed the Daily's offices until 1988, after which its new corporate owners and new publisher, Arthur Anderman, moved them to a building on the Miracle Mile on Wilshire Boulevard.\nIn late 2008, Variety moved its Los Angeles offices to 5900 Wilshire, a 31-story office building on Wilshire Boulevard in the Miracle Mile area. The building was dubbed the Variety Building because a red, illuminated \"Variety\" sign graced the top of the building.\nIn 2013, PMC, the parent company of Variety, announced plans to move Variety's offices to their new corporate headquarters at 11175 Santa Monica Blvd. in Westwood. There, Variety shares the 9-story building with parent company PMC, Variety Intelligence Platform, and PMC's other media brands, including Deadline.com, Rolling Stone, Vibe, Billboard, Robb Report and the West Coast offices of WWD and Footwear News.\n\nContent\nFilm reviews\nOn January 19, 1907, Variety published what is considered the first film review in history. Two reviews written by Sime Silverman were published: Pathe's comedy short An Exciting Honeymoon and Edison Studios' western short The Life of a Cowboy directed by Edwin S. Porter. Variety discontinued reviews of films between March 1911 until January 1913 as they were convinced by a film producer, believed to be George Kleine, that they were wasting space criticizing moving pictures and others had suggested that favorable reviews brought too strong a demand for certain pictures to the exclusion of others. Despite the gap, Variety is still the longest unbroken source of film criticism in existence.\nIn 1930 Variety also started publishing a summary of miniature reviews for the films reviewed that week and in 1951 the editors decided to position the capsules on top of the reviews, a tradition retained today.\n\nFilm reviewers\nWriting reviews was a side job for Variety staff, most of whom were hired to be reporters and not film or theatre critics. Many of the publication's reviewers identified their work with four-letter pen names (\"sigs\") rather than with their full names. The practice stopped in August 1991. Those abbreviated names include the following:\n\nAbel \u2013 Abel Green, editor 1931\u20131973\nAnby \u2013 Vincent Canby, 1951\u20131957, later chief film critic for The New York Times\nArmy \u2013 Army Archerd\nBeau \u2013 Lee Beaupre\nBell \u2013 Harry Ennis\nBesa \u2013 Peter Besas\nBige \u2013 Joe Bigelow\nBill \u2013 Bill Greeley\nBing \u2013 Claude Binyon\nBok \u2013 Bob Knight\nByro \u2013 Stuart Byron\nCart \u2013 Todd McCarthy, 1979\u20131989; film review editor 1991\u20132010.\nChic \u2013 Epes W Sargeant\nCon \u2013 John White Conway (1888\u20131928)\nDaku \u2013 Dave Kaufman\nDrek \u2013 Derek Elley\nEdba \u2013 Ed Barry\nEdwa \u2013 Bill Edwards\nFob \u2013 Frank Beermann\nFred \u2013 Fred Schader\nGene \u2013 Gene Arneel\nGilb \u2013 George Gilbert\nHar \u2013 James Harwood\nHawk \u2013 Robert Hawkins\nHell \u2013 Jack Hellmann\nHerm \u2013 Herman Schoenfeld\nHobe \u2013 Hobe Morrison\nHoll and Hyho \u2013 Hy Hollinger, 1953\u20131960, 1979\u20131992\nJac \u2013 Harlan Jacobson\nJolo \u2013 Joshua Lowe\nJose \u2013 Joe Cohen\nKirb \u2013 Fred Kirby\nLait \u2013 Jack Lait\nLand \u2013 Robert J.

These are contained in the 24-volume Variety Film Reviews (1907\u20131996). Film reviews continue to be published in Variety. The other two periodicals are The New York Times (as The New York Times Film Reviews (1913\u20132000) in 22 volumes) and Harrison's Reports (as Harrison's Reports and Film Reviews (1919\u20131962) in 15 volumes).\nIn 1992, Variety published the Variety Movie Guide containing a collection of 5,000 abridged reviews edited by Derek Elley. The last edition was published in 2001 with 8,500 reviews. Many of the abridged reviews for films prior to 1998 are published on Variety.com unless they have later posted the original review.\n\nObituaries\nThe complete text of approximately 100,000 entertainment-related obituaries (1905\u20131986) was reprinted as Variety Obituaries, an 11-volume set, including alphabetical index. Four additional bi-annual reprints were published (for 1987\u20131994) before the reprint series was discontinued.\nThe annual anniversary edition published in January would often contain a necrology of the entertainment people who had died that year.\n\nCharts and data\nVariety started reporting box office grosses for films by theatre on March 3, 1922, to give exhibitors around the country information on a film's performance on Broadway, which was often where first run showings of a film were held. In addition to New York City, they also endeavored to include all of the key cities in the U.S. in the future and initially also reported results for ten other cities including Chicago and Los Angeles. They continued to report these grosses for films until 1989 when they put the data into a summarized weekly chart and only published the data by theatre for New York and Los Angeles as well as other international cities such as London and Paris.\nAs media expanded over the years, charts and data for other media such as TV ratings and music charts were published, especially in the anniversary editions that were regularly published each January.\nDuring the 1930s, charts of the top performing films of the year were published and this tradition has been maintained annually since.\nIn 1946, a weekly National Box Office survey was published on page 3 indicating the performance of the week's hits and flops based on the box office results of 25 key U.S. cities. Later that year, a list of All-Time Top Grossers with a list of films that had achieved or gave promise of earning $4,000,000 or more in domestic (United States and Canada) rentals was published. An updated chart was published annually for over 50 years, normally in the anniversary edition each January.\nIn the late 1960s, Variety started to use an IBM 360 computer to collate the grosses from their weekly reports of 22 to 24 U.S. cities from January 1, 1968. The data came from up to 800 theatres which represented around 5% of the U.S. cinema population at the time but around one-third of the total U.S. box office grosses. In 1969, they started to publish the computerized box office compilation of the top 50 grossing films of the week based on this data. \"The Love Bug\" was the number one in the first chart published for the week ending April 16, 1969. The chart format was changed in 1989 to reduce the list to a top 40 and display a summary of the sample city theater grosses rather than publish the theater grosses separately. The sample chart was discontinued in 1990.\nArthur D. Murphy, who joined Variety in 1964 and worked there until 1993, was one of the first to organize and chart domestic box office gross information that became more available during the 1980s and report it in a meaningful form setting a standard for how film box office information is reported today. Murphy used the weekly sample reports to estimate the total US weekly box office compared with previous annual totals which was reported in Variety's US Box Office Report each week. The sample also allowed Murphy to estimate the Market Share percentage rankings of distributors.\nIn 1976, Variety Box Office Index (VBI) was launched where each month's actual key city box office tally, after seasonal adjustment, was simultaneously expressed as an index number, with 1970 as a whole being used as the base initially. The current month's VBI expressed the monthly box office performance as a percentage change from the base year. The index was published until 1991 giving a history of comparable monthly and annual box office performance for the past 20 years.\nDuring the 1980s, Daily Variety started to publish a weekly chart of the domestic box office grosses of films as compared to the Top 50 chart in Variety which was based on a sample of key markets. Variety started to publish this weekend box office report together with the sample top 50 chart (later top 40) until they discontinued the sample chart in February 1990 with the weekend box office report being their main source of box office reporting.\nIn 2009, Variety launched a chart showcasing the top performing film trailers ahead of theatrical release in partnership with media measurement firm Visible Measures.\n\nOther Variety products\nIn 1937, Variety compiled and published a Radio Directory compiling a record of events in radio such as program histories, ratings and popularity polls. It published an annual edition for the next three years which are available on the Media History Digital Library.\nIn 1981, Variety International Showbusiness Reference was published, which they claimed was the first book to contain a complete list of all winners and nominees for the Academy Awards, Emmy Awards, Tony Awards, Grammy Awards and Pulitzer Prize. The following year they published Variety major U.S. showbusiness awards containing just this award details and a revised edition, called Variety presents the complete book of major U.S. show business awards, was published in 1985.\nIn 1988, R.R. Bowker, a Reed Reference Publishing Company, part of Reed-Elsevier, PLC, a \"sister\" company to Variety, published Variety's Video Directory Plus, a CD-ROM subscription product, updated quarterly, containing metadata about 90,000 home video products and full-text film reviews from Variety.\n\nPeter Cowie joined Variety in 1989 and his International Film Guide, which had been published annually since 1964, became Variety International Film Guide with reports from countries on the year in cinema as well as information of film festivals. It continued to bear Variety's name until 2006.\nIn 1990, Variety published a 15-volume set of its television reviews (including home video product) from 1923 to 1988. Additional supplements were published covering 1989\u20131990, 1991\u20131992 and 1993\u20131994.\nIn 1999, Cowie published The Variety Insider with detailed information on the year in entertainment as well as historical information. A second edition followed in 2000.\n\nVariety Studio: Actors on Actors\nIn November 2014, Variety premiered Variety Studio: Actors on Actors, a co-production with PBS SoCal that featured two actors discussing their craft and thoughts on Hollywood, which subsequently went on to win three Emmy awards, including a Daytime Creative Arts Award in May 2019.\nIn January 2017, they launched the Variety Content Studio, creating custom content for brands.\n\nVariety Insight\nVariety established its data and research division, Variety Insight, in 2011 when it acquired entertainment data company, TVtracker.com. Its film database was announced in December 2011 as FlixTracker, but was later folded into Variety Insight. Variety positioned the subscription service as an alternative to crowd-sourced websites, such as the IMDb. The database uses Variety's existing relationships with the studios to get information. The New York Observer identified the main competitor as Baseline StudioSystems. In 2014, Variety Insight added Vscore, a measure of actors' cachet and bankability. In 2015, it partnered with ScriptNoted, a social media website for film scripts.\n\nVariety Australia\nVariety Australia is a website owned by Brag Media, published under license from Variety Media, LLC. It covers film, TV and music around the world, but with a special focus on the Australian and New Zealand industries.

It was nominated for numerous awards at the 2011 Japan Academy Prize, including Best Film and Best Director (which was director Lee's second nomination, after his 2006 win for Hula Girls), and won five, which included all four acting awards and for the score by Joe Hisaishi.\n\nPlot\nAbandoned by his mother at an early age, Yuichi Shimizu is a young man who lives with and takes care of his grandparents in a decaying fishing village near Nagasaki. He works as a blue-collar day-labourer and leads a lonely life: his only real interest is his car.\nLooking for companionship through online dating sites, Yuichi meets Yoshino Ishibashi, a young insurance saleswoman from Fukuoka. But it is clear that Yoshino has no respect for Yuichi. She looks down on him, and even demands money for their encounters, which\u2014as she candidly tells her friends\u2014are just about sex. It becomes apparent that Yoshino keenly feels her own lack of social status (as the daughter of a barber), and has her real sights set on a spoiled rich university student by the name of Keigo Masuo, whom she met in a bar and subsequently pesters with emails.\nDuring a fateful evening when Yoshino has just met Yuichi for one of their regular trysts (and also to collect money from him), she by chance runs into Masuo, and unceremoniously dumps Yuichi (who has driven hours from Nagasaki to see her) with hardly a word spoken. But, in his turn, Masuo has no respect for Yoshino, whom he feels is beneath him. He agrees to take her for a drive (and presumably something more), but is increasingly disgusted by her, insults her, and ends up violently throwing her out of his car on an isolated mountain road, leaving her stranded in the middle of the night. The humiliated Yuichi, however, has secretly followed the couple in his own car, and attempts to come to the aid of the abandoned Yoshino. But\u2014far from being grateful\u2014Yoshino scorns and abuses Yuichi in much the same way that Masuo has just scorned and abused her. The abuse turns into ugly threats, a tussle ensues, and in a fit of rage Yuichi strangles Yoshino and then flees. Since Yoshino had openly bragged to her friends beforehand that she was to meet the rich playboy Masuo that evening (and not her shameful working-class sex partner Yuichi), Masuo becomes the prime suspect in the murder. In a state of silent anguish, Yuichi attempts to go on with his daily life.\nThe following day, however, Yuichi receives an email. The message is from Mitsuyo Magome, a woman from Saga. Yuichi and Mitsuyo had exchanged emails once before, after meeting through the same online dating site. Mitsuyo also lives a lonely and mundane life, working at a men's clothing store and living with her younger sister. Looking for companionship, Mitsuyo decided to re-contact Yuichi several months after their initial correspondence. Their first encounter is far from romantic\u2014Yuichi is obviously troubled and only interested in sex. It seems unlikely they will meet again, but some days later he turns up at her place of work to apologise for his behaviour.\nIn this impossible and doomed situation, a passionate love springs up between Yuichi and Mitsuyo: they run off to a seaside resort town, where Yuichi confesses his crime to her. By this time, however, Masuo has been cleared of the murder, and evidence has surfaced of Yuichi's involvement\u2014Yuichi is now the wanted criminal: his face appears on the news, and his family are hounded by the media. \nNevertheless, Mitsuyo persuades Yuichi to stay on the run with her and not turn himself in. This act places a heavy burden on their own families as well as the victim's family.\n\nCast\nYuichi Shimizu - Satoshi Tsumabuki\nYoshino Ishibashi - Hikari Mitsushima\nKeigo Masuo - Masaki Okada\nMitsuyo Magome - Eri Fukatsu\n\nAwards\n34th Japan Academy Prize\nWon:\nBest Actor - Satoshi Tsumabuki\nBest Actress - Eri Fukatsu\nBest Supporting Actor - Akira Emoto\nBest Supporting Actress - Kirin Kiki\nBest Music - Joe Hisaishi\nNominations:\nBest Film\nBest Director - Lee Sang-il\nBest Supporting Actor - Masaki Okada\nBest Supporting Actress - Hikari Mitsushima\n2010 Kinema Junpo Awards\nWon: Best Film\nWon: Best Director - Lee Sang-il\nWon: Best Supporting Actor - Akira Emoto\n65th Mainichi Film Awards\nWon: Best Film\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website (in Japanese)\nVillain at IMDb","240":"Vengeance Is Mine (Japanese: \u5fa9\u8b90\u3059\u308b\u306f\u6211\u306b\u3042\u308a, Hepburn: Fukush\u016b Suru wa Ware ni Ari) is a 1979 Japanese film directed by Sh\u014dhei Imamura, based on the book of the same name by Ry\u016bz\u014d Saki. It depicts the true story of serial killer Akira Nishiguchi, changing the protagonist's name to Iwao Enokizu.\n\nPlot\nIn the opening scenes, serial killer Iwao Enokizu is taken to a police station, where he is greeted by an angry mob and a huge crowd of journalists. The police interrogate him, but he refuses to answer. The film then switches to a series of flashback sequences, starting with the initial murders. Enokizu tricks and then kills two men, steals their money and disappears. He travels to another city, where he asks a taxi driver to take him to an inn where he can get a prostitute. He tells the innkeeper, a woman called Haru, that he is a professor at Kyoto University. The police, searching for Enokizu, put out bulletins with his face on television. The prostitute thinks the professor is Enokizu, but she is told not to go to the police because of her job.\nIn a flashback going back to Enokizu's childhood, he is seen as a rebellious, violent child and son of a Catholic father Shizuo, whose fishing boats were forcibly conscripted by the Japanese Navy in the 1930s. As a young man after the war, Enokizu is convicted and imprisoned for fraud. His wife Kazuko, who is attracted to Shizuo, divorces Enokizu, but is persuaded by Shizuo to remarry him, due to his Catholic beliefs. After the remarriage, Kazuko and Shizuo engage in a sexual act while bathing, during which the latter coldly rebuffs her. Shizuo then encourages a railway worker to sleep with Kazuko to satiate her. Enokizu, discharged from prison and suspecting a dalliance, accuses her of sleeping with Shizuo while he served his sentence.\nEnokizu, still wanted by the police, travels to Tokyo. He tricks the mother of a young defendant into giving him the bail money for her son. He then befriends a lawyer, kills him and uses his apartment, where he hides his victim's body. He sends some money to Haru, and travels back to her place, where Haru's mother, a convicted murderer, has recently been released from prison. Haru and her mother realise that the alleged professor is the wanted man, but keep it a secret. Enokizu and Haru enter into a tentative relationship. Haru is raped by a benefactor who uses her as his mistress, while her mother and Enokizu are forced to watch silently. Enokizu, sure that Haru is carrying their unborn child, kills both Haru and her mother and pawns their goods. The prostitute from before, upon seeing Enokizu again, reports him to the police.\nFive years later, Enokizu has been executed and cremated. His father and wife go to the top of a mountain to scatter his ashes, but the thrown bones remain hanging in the air.\n\nCast\nKen Ogata as Iwao Enokizu\nRentar\u014d Mikuni as Shizuo Enokizu, Iwao's father\nMitsuko Baisho\u2013 \u500d\u8cde\u7f8e\u6d25\u5b50 \u2013 as Kazuko Enokizu, Iwao's wife\nChocho Miyako as Kayo Enokizu, Iwao's mother\nMayumi Ogawa\u2013 \u5c0f\u5ddd\u771f\u7531\u7f8e \u2013 as Haru Asano\nNijiko Kiyokawa as Hisano Asano, Haru's mother\nTaiji Tonoyama as Tanejiro Shibata, the first victim\nGoro Tarumi as Daihachi Baba, the second victim\nMoeko Ezawa as Chiyoko Hata\nKazuko Shirakawa as Sachiko Yoshizato\nFrankie Sakai as Detective Kawai\nTorahiko Hamada as Chief Detective Yoshino\nYasuhisa Sonoda as Detective Kuwata\nAkira Hamada as Detective Ichikawa\nKazunaga Tsuji as Detective Kuchiishi\nSh\u014dhei Hino as Haru's friend\nYoshi Kat\u014d as the lawyer Kawashima, the third victim\nToshie Negishi as the prostitute (\"stick girl\")\nKin Sugai as Defendant's mother\n\nReception\nJasper Sharp commented, \"Both seducing and repelling with its unusual story and grisly humour, Imamura uncovers a seedy underbelly of civilised Japanese society.\" Roger Ebert called the movie \"a cry of despair and hopelessness on behalf of its insane hero\" and \"poignant, tragic and banal enough to deserve the comparison with Crime and Punishment.\"\n\nAwards\nThe film won the 1979 Best Picture Award at the Japanese Academy Awards, and was awarded for Best Screenplay and Best Actor (Ken Ogata) at the Yokohama Film Festival.\n\nReferences\nSources\nBuehrer, Beverley (1990). \"Vengeance Is Mine (1979) Fukusho sure wa ware ni ari\".

It was the top-grossing Japanese film of the silent era. Notable as an example of the tendency film genre, it reportedly caused a riot upon its showing in Tokyo's Asakusa district.\n\nPlot\nThe plot centers on a schoolgirl, Sumiko, who has been sent to live with her uncle. Arriving to a harried household with many children, her aunt and alcoholic uncle are annoyed by her arrival. A note, which Sumiko cannot read, announces that her father has killed himself. After being denied schooling and placed into labor for the family, Sumiko is eventually sold to a circus where she suffers at the hands of its members and ringmaster. Sumiko escapes with another circus performer, Shintaro, but Sumiko joins a team of thieves and ends up arrested. She is given work in the home of a wealthy aristocratic family, who denies even the simplest of pleasures to their staff out of cruelty. She is sent to a Christian orphanage, where she is humiliated for writing a letter to an old friend, and must make a public speech renouncing her ways and accepting Christ into her heart.

The film was an enormous commercial success, with press reports of riots following its showing in Tokyo's Asakusa district.\nIn his 2005 book A Hundred Years of Japanese Film, film historian Donald Richie titled the film \"a melodramatic potboiler\", at the same time acknowledging it for being \"also extraordinarily film literate\".\n\nRestoration\nThe film, thought to be lost after World War II, was restored in 1997 from an incomplete print found in the Russian Gosfilmofond archive in 1994.

Starring Y\u016b Aoi and Issey Takahashi, the film is set in Japan during World War II, and centers on a wife who starts suspecting that her husband may be a spy for the United States.\nA theatrical version of Wife of a Spy was selected in the main competition section of the 77th Venice International Film Festival, where it won the Silver Lion.\n\nPlot\nMembers of the Japanese military police seize and arrest a British silk merchant on charges of espionage.\nIn 1940, Y\u016bsaku Fukuhara (Takahashi) runs an international import-export business in Kobe. After the arrest, and subsequent release, of the British merchant, a unit of the military police arrive at his office. Taiji (Higashide), the recently-promoted leader of the unit and a childhood friend of Y\u016bsaku's wife, warns Y\u016bsaku that relevant authorities are keeping an eye on him under the National Mobilization Law, in part because of his preference for Western clothing, imported goods, and close contact with foreigners. Y\u016bsaku is unconcerned with the growing tension in society and unaffected by Taiji's visit. The British merchant says goodbye to Y\u016bsaku and his wife Satoko (Aoi) at their home and tells them he is going to Shanghai as he can no longer do business in Japan.\nSatoko stars as a glamorous thief in an amateur heist film with Y\u016bsaku's nephew Fumio (Band\u014d) and Y\u016bsaku screens the film for his colleagues at the office's b\u014dnenkai. After the new year, he informs Satoko that he and Fumio are going on a short business trip to Manchuria to import cheap medicine and other goods. Their trip is delayed an additional two weeks and return to Kobe with a woman whom Y\u016bsaku does not mention to Satoko. Shortly after their return, Fumio announces that he will be leaving the company for a ryokan in Arima to write a novel about his experiences in Manchuria before he is drafted.\nSatoko becomes increasingly suspicious of Y\u016bsaku after learning about the woman who returned with her husband, Hiroko Kusakabe (Hyunri), after a tip-off from Taiji that Hiroko has been murdered and Y\u016bsaku applied for passports for himself and Hiroko to leave the country. She visits Fumio in Arima and finds him disheveled and incandescent in his room, where he shouts at her about her unseeing ignorance of her husband's actions to maintain her comfortable lifestyle. He informs her that he is being watched by the military police, and gives her a package for Y\u016bsaku, correctly assuming that the police standing outside the ryokan will not interrogate her. At home, Y\u016bsaku explains what he and Fumio saw in Manchuria: biological experiments, including deliberately spreading plague, committed by Unit 731 (not explicitly named) on civilians in Manchuria. The package Satoko received from Fumio contained notes from one of the doctors procured by Hiroko, a  copy translated into English by Fumio, and a short film of the facilities used for experimentation, corpses, vivisection, and the burning of bodies. Satoko accuses Y\u016bsaku of being an American spy and unconcerned with their lives, but he explains he is not spying for any country; rather, he is making the information public in the name of  justice.\nIn the office, Y\u016bsaku  puts the package from Fumio into a safe in the back of the office, but Satoko is able to open the safe using the combination she was given while shooting Y\u016bsaku's short film. While she is closing the safe, she knocks over a chessboard and is unable to return the pieces to their correct position. Later, Y\u016bsaku notices the chess pieces in the wrong positions, opens the safe, and realizes the Japanese notebook has been taken. Fumio is arrested by Taiji and the military police and tortured for sharing national secrets with the enemy. When Taiji summons Y\u016bsaku to the office, he reveals that Fumio admitted to everything and that he worked alone. While Taiji doesn't believe Fumio's forced confession, he has the notebook which was turned into him by an anonymous citizen. Y\u016bsaku returns home and questions Satoko, who admits she gave the notebook to Taiji, but she was sure that Fumio would not implicate Y\u016bsaku even under torture. Together they watch the beginning of the short film which contains shots of the original Japanese notebook. Y\u016bsaku admits that there is a second, longer film with better detail and more clarity that he plans to show the Americans.\nIn 1941, the U.S. places an oil embargo on Japan. Y\u016bsaku's chances of leaving Japan to give the information of the illegal experiments to the Allies are almost nothing. While he cannot leave under legal means, he is able to smuggle himself out of the country in a shipping crate. Satoko agrees to go with him and help prepare for the trip. They exchange Japanese yen for watches and jewelry to pay for their journey overseas. Before they are about to leave, under the guise of taking a two-week trip so as to not arouse suspicion, Y\u016bsaku decides they should split up. Satoko will take the film of the experiments in the shipping crate of a freighter, and he will go to America from Shanghai. However once Satoko is in the shipping crate, the military police search the ship for a stowaway and the man Y\u016bsaku paid to smuggle Satoko shows the police where she is hiding. She is brought before Taiji and beseeches him to be the gentle person she knew in childhood, but he hits her across the face and says that she deserves death for treason. The military police screen the film Satoko was smuggling but it is revealed that Y\u016bsaku swapped the film of the experiments with the amateur film he made of Satoko and Fumio months ago. With no other evidence to convict her, Satoko is released from police custody. Y\u016bsaku is shown sailing away on a small fishing boat to Shanghai.\nIn March 1945, Satoko has been confined to a mental hospital for an untold number of months when Dr. Nozaki, a friend of hers and Y\u016bsaku's, comes to see her and promises to get her out through his connections with Imperial University. He admits having heard a rumor that Y\u016bsaku was seen in Bombay boarding a ship to Los Angeles which is believed to have sunk. That night, an air raid on Kobe destroys the hospital and Satoko leaves barefoot. She walks alone to the beach and collapses on the sand, screaming and crying.\nThe final scene states that Y\u016bsaku Fukuhara was declared dead in 1946 but there were signs of forgery on the death certificate; Satoko Fukuhara left for the United States a few years later.\n\nCast\nY\u016b Aoi as Satoko Fukuhara (\u798f\u539f \u8061\u5b50, Fukuhara Satoko)\nIssey Takahashi as Y\u016bsaku Fukuhara (\u798f\u539f \u512a\u4f5c, Fukuhara Y\u016bsaku)\nMasahiro Higashide as Taiji Tsumori (\u6d25\u68ee \u6cf0\u6cbb, Tsumori Taiji)\nRy\u014dta Band\u014d as Fumio Takeshita (\u7af9\u4e0b \u6587\u96c4, Takeshita Fumio)\nYuri Tsunematsu as Komako (\u99d2\u5b50, Komako)\nMinosuke as Kanamura (\u91d1\u6751, Kanamura)\nHyunri as Hiroko Kusakabe (\u8349\u58c1 \u5f18\u5b50, Kusakabe Hiroko)\nTakashi Sasano as Doctor Nozaki (\u91ce\u5d0e, Nozaki)\n\nRelease\nWife of a Spy was first broadcast in Japan on NHK's NHK BS4K and NHK BS8K on 6 June 2020.\nA theatrical version of the film, with different aspect ratio and color grading, had its world premiere at the 77th Venice International Film Festival on 8 September 2020.

It received widespread critical acclaim and was nominated for two Academy Awards. The screenplay for the film was adapted by K\u014db\u014d Abe from his 1962 novel of the same name. The film is now considered to be Teshigahara's masterpiece, one of the best movies of 1964, of the 1960s and of the 20th century, as well as one of the best Japanese films of all time.\nThe film follows an amateur entomologist (Okada) who is led to settle in the house of a lonely widow (Kishida) at the bottom of a sand dune in a rural coastal village. He soon realizes that the villagers have trapped him there and expect him to work for them.\n\nPlot\nSchoolteacher and amateur entomologist Niki Junpei leaves Tokyo on an expedition to a rural coastal village to collect tiger beetles and other insects that live in sandy soil. After a long day of searching, he misses the last bus ride back to the city. A village elder and some of the other locals suggest that he stay the night at their village. Junpei agrees and is guided down a rope ladder to a hut at the bottom of a sand dune, the home of a young woman. He learns that she lost her husband and daughter in a sandstorm a year ago and now lives alone; their bodies are said to be buried under the sand somewhere near the hut. After dinner, the woman goes outside to shovel the sand into buckets, which the villagers reel in from the top of the dune. Junpei offers to help, but she refuses, telling him that he is a guest and there is no need for him to help on the first day.\nThe next morning, Junpei gets ready to leave but finds that the rope ladder has been pulled up. Unable to escape, as the sand surrounding the hut is too steep and does not give him enough grip to climb, he quickly realises that he is trapped and expected to live with the woman and assist her in digging the sand, which is sold to cement manufacturers on the black market. He begrudgingly accepts this role, which the woman has long accepted without question.\nJunpei becomes the widow's lover but hopes to escape. One evening, he climbs out of the pit with an improvised grappling hook and runs away, with the villagers in pursuit. Unfamiliar with the geography of the area, he becomes trapped in quicksand. The villagers free him and return him to the hut.\nJunpei eventually resigns himself to his situation but requests time each day to see the nearby sea; the villagers agree on the condition that he has sex with the woman while the they watch. Junpei agrees, but she refuses and fends him off. Through his persistent efforts to trap a crow as a messenger, he discovers a way to draw water from the damp sand at night by capillary action and becomes absorbed in perfecting the technique. When the woman becomes ill from an ectopic pregnancy, the villagers take her to a doctor; they leave the rope ladder down, but Junpei chooses to stay, telling himself that he can still escape after showing the villagers his method of water production.\nThe film's final shot is of a police report stating that Junpei has been missing for seven years.\n\nCast\nEiji Okada as Niki Junpei, an amateur entomologist and schoolteacher from Tokyo. Okada was cast in various Japanese films in the 1950s, but it was not until he appeared in Hiroshima mon amour in 1959 that he gained a worldwide reputation.\nKy\u014dko Kishida as the widow in the dunes. Kishida was a Japanese actress, voice performer, and writer of children's books. In addition to Woman in the Dunes, in the West she is best known for The Face of Another (1966, also directed by Teshigahara) and Yasujir\u014d Ozu's An Autumn Afternoon (1962). She was a founding member of the theater group Engeki Shudan En, which was formed in 1975.\nK\u014dji Mitsui as the village elder who lures the entomologist to the widow's home. He was billed above the film's title on the original Woman in the Dunes film poster, alongside Okada and Kishida, with the studio-era convention of appending his name with small characters indicating that Toho had borrowed the contracted player from Shochiku.\n\nProduction\nDevelopment\nPrior to the production of Woman in the Dunes, Hiroshi Teshigahara directed Pitfall (\u304a\u3068\u3057\u7a74, Otoshiana), a.k.a. The Pitfall and Kashi To Kodomo, which was written by K\u014db\u014d Abe. Pitfall was Teshigahara's first feature, and the first of his four film collaborations with Abe and Takemitsu.\n\nTechnical details\nWith a run time of 123 minutes \/ 147 minutes (director's cut), the film was shot in 35 mm negative format by Hiroshi Segawa, the director of photography.\n\nLocation\nWoman in the Dunes was shot on location at the Hamaoka sand dunes in Omaezaki, Shizuoka Prefecture, although many sources in English erroneously report that the film was shot in the Tottori Sand Dunes in Tottori Prefecture.\n\nRelease\nThe roadshow version of Woman in the Dunes was released in Japan on February 15, 1964 where it was distributed by Toho. The general release for Woman in the Dunes in Japan was April 18, 1964; the film was cut to 127 minutes.\nThe film was released in the United States by Pathe Contemporary Films with English subtitles on September 17, 1964. The film ran at 127 minutes. The film was also featured in the New York Film Festival on September 16, 1964.\nThe film was also featured in several other film festivals across the world such as the Cannes Film Festival in France, Adelaide Film Festival in Australia, and Clasicos del Cine Japones in Argentina on November 21, 2000.\nThe Criterion Collection released a DVD box set collecting Woman in the Dunes in its original length along with Teshigahara's Pitfall and The Face of Another in 2007. This release is now out of print. In August 2016, Criterion released the film as a stand-alone Blu-ray with a brand new high definition transfer.\n\nCritical reception\nThe film has a rating of 100% on review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes based on 27 reviews, with an average rating of 8.5\/10. It was one of Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky's ten favorite movies.\nRoger Ebert inducted Woman in the Dunes into his Great Movies list in 1998. Viewing the work as a retelling of the Sisyphus myth, he wrote: \"There has never been sand photography like this (no, not even in \"Lawrence of Arabia\"), and by anchoring the story so firmly in this tangible physical reality, the cinematographer, Hiroshi Segawa, helps the director pull off the difficult feat of telling a parable as if it is really happening.\" Strictly Film School describes it as \"a spare and haunting allegory for human existence\". According to Max Tessier, the main theme of the film is the desire to escape from society.\nThe film's composer, Toru Takemitsu, was praised. Nathaniel Thompson wrote, \"[Takemitsu's] often jarring, experimental music here is almost a character unto itself, insinuating itself into the fabric of the celluloid as imperceptibly as the sand.\" Ebert also stated that the score \"doesn't underline the action but mocks it, with high, plaintive notes, harsh, like a metallic wind.\"\n\nAwards\nThe film won a Special Jury Prize at the 1964 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in the same year (losing to Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow). In 1965, Teshigahara was nominated for the Best Director Oscar (losing to Robert Wise for The Sound of Music). In 1967, the film won the Grand Prix of the Belgian Film Critics Association.\n\nSee also\nList of Japanese submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film\nList of submissions to the 37th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film\nThe House of Sand\n\nReferences\nSources\nExternal links\nWoman in the Dunes at IMDb\nWoman in the Dunes at AllMovie\nWoman in the Dunes at the TCM Movie Database\nWoman in the Dunes at the Japanese Movie Database (in Japanese)\nWoman in the Dunes: Shifting Sands an essay by Audie Bock at the Criterion Collection","248":"Yojimbo (Japanese: \u7528\u5fc3\u68d2, Hepburn: Y\u014djinb\u014d, lit. Bodyguard) is a 1961 Japanese samurai film directed by Akira Kurosawa, who also co-wrote the screenplay and was one of the producers. The film stars Toshiro Mifune, Tatsuya Nakadai, Yoko Tsukasa, Isuzu Yamada, Daisuke Kat\u014d, Takashi Shimura, Kamatari Fujiwara, and Atsushi Watanabe. In the film, a r\u014dnin arrives in a small town where competing crime lords fight for supremacy. The two bosses each try to hire the newcomer as a bodyguard.\nBased on the success of Yojimbo, Kurosawa's next film, Sanjuro (1962), was altered to incorporate the lead character of this film. In both films, the character wears a rather dilapidated dark kimono bearing the same family mon.\nThe film was released and produced by Toho on April 25, 1961. Yojimbo received highly positive reviews, and, over the years, became widely regarded as one of the best films by Kurosawa and one of the greatest films ever made. The film grossed an estimated $2.5 million worldwide with a budget of \u00a590.87 million,$631,000. It was unofficially remade by Sergio Leone as the Spaghetti Western film A Fistful of Dollars (1964), leading to a lawsuit by Toho.\n\nPlot\nIn 1860, during the final years of the Edo period, a r\u014dnin wanders through a desolate countryside. Coming to a fork in the road, he chooses which path to take at random.\nStopping at a farmhouse for water, the r\u014dnin overhears an elderly couple lamenting that their only son has run off to join the \"gamblers\" in a nearby town, which is overrun with criminals and contested by two rival yakuza gangs.\nIn the town, the r\u014dnin stops at a small izakaya (tavern). The owner Gonji advises him to leave. Gonji tells the r\u014dnin that the two warring bosses, Ushitora and Seibei, are fighting over the lucrative gambling trade run by Seibei. Ushitora had been Seibei's right-hand man until Seibei decided that his successor would be his son Yoichiro, a useless youth. The town's mayor, a silk merchant named Tazaemon, had long been in Seibei's pocket, so Ushitora aligned himself with the local sake brewer, Tokuemon, proclaiming him the new mayor.\nAfter sizing up the situation and recognizing that no one in town cares about ending the violence, the stranger says he intends to stay, as the town would be better off with both sides dead. He convinces the weaker Seibei to hire his services by effortlessly killing three of Ushitora's men. When asked his name, he sees a mulberry field and states his name is Kuwabatake (\"mulberry field\") Sanjuro (\"thirty-years-old\") (\u6851\u7551\u4e09\u5341\u90ce).\nSeibei decides that with the ronin's help, it is time to deal with Ushitora. Sanjuro eavesdrops on Seibei's wife, who orders Yoichiro to prove himself by killing the ronin after the upcoming raid, saving them from having to pay him. Sanjuro leads the attack on Ushitora's faction, but then \"resigns\" over Seibei's treachery, expecting both sides to massacre each other. His plan is foiled due to the unexpected arrival of a bugy\u014d (a government official), which prompts both Seibei and Ushitora to make a bloodless retreat.\nThe bugy\u014d leaves soon after to investigate the assassination of a fellow official in another town. Overhearing the assassins discussing the hit in Gonji's tavern, Sanjuro later captures them and sells them to Seibei. Then he comes to Ushitora and tells him Seibei's men caught the assassins. Alarmed, Ushitora generously rewards Sanjuro for his \"help,\" and kidnaps Yoichiro to exchange for the two assassins. At the swap, Ushitora's brother Unosuke kills the assassins with a pistol. \nAnticipating this, Seibei reveals he had ordered the kidnapping of Tokuemon\u2019s mistress. The next morning, she is exchanged for Yoichiro. Sanjuro learns that the mistress, Nui, is a local farmer's wife. After he sold her to Ushitora to settle a gambling debt, Ushitora gave her to Tokuemon as chattel to gain his support. After tricking Ushitora into revealing where Nui is held, Sanjuro kills the guards and reunites the woman with her husband and son, ordering them to leave town immediately. He comes to Ushitora and informs him that Seibei is responsible for killing his men. \nThe gang war escalates, with Ushitora burning down Tazaemon's silk warehouse and Seibei retaliating by trashing Tokuemon's brewery. After some time, Unosuke becomes suspicious of Sanjuro and the circumstances surrounding Nui's escape, eventually uncovering evidence of the ronin's betrayal. Sanjuro is severely beaten and imprisoned by Ushitora's thugs, who torture him to find out Nui's whereabouts.\nWhen Ushitora decides to eliminate Seibei once and for all, Sanjuro escapes. Smuggled out of town in a coffin by Gonji, Sanjuro witnesses the brutal end of Seibei and his family. Sanjuro recuperates in a small temple near a cemetery. \nUpon learning Gonji has been captured by Ushitora, he returns to town. In a final confrontation with Ushitora, Unosuke, and their gang, Sanjuro dispatches them. He spares a terrified young man (the son of the elderly couple from the opening of the film) and sends him back to his parents. As Sanjuro surveys the damage, a now insane Tazaemon comes out of his home in a samurai outfit and stabs Tokuemon to death. Sanjuro frees Gonji, proclaims that the town will be quiet from then on, and departs.\n\nCast\nProduction\nWriting\nKurosawa stated that a major source for the plot was the 1942 film noir classic The Glass Key, an adaptation of Dashiell Hammett's 1931 novel of the same name. It has been noted that the overall plot of Yojimbo is closer to that of another Hammett novel, Red Harvest (1929).  Kurosawa scholar David Desser, and film critic Manny Farber claim that Red Harvest was the inspiration for the film; however, Donald Richie and other scholars believe the similarities are coincidental.\nWhen asked his name, the samurai calls himself \"Kuwabatake Sanjuro\", which he seems to make up while looking at a mulberry field by the town. Thus, the character can be viewed as an early example of the \"Man with No Name\" (other examples of which appear in a number of earlier novels, including Dashiell Hammett's Red Harvest).\n\nCasting\nMany of the actors in Yojimbo worked with Kurosawa before and after, especially Toshiro Mifune, Takashi Shimura and Tatsuya Nakadai.\n\nFilming\nAfter Kurosawa scolded Mifune for arriving late to the set one morning; Mifune made it a point to be ready on set at 6:00 AM every day in full makeup and costume for the rest of the film's shooting schedule.\nThis was the second film where director Akira Kurosawa worked with cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa (the first being Rashomon in 1950).\nThe sword instruction and choreography for the film were done by Yoshio Sugino of the Tenshin Sh\u014dden Katori Shint\u014d-ry\u016b and Ry\u016b Kuze.\n\nMusic\nThe soundtrack for the film has received positive reviews. Michael Wood writing retrospectively for the London Review of Books found the film's soundtrack by Masaru Sato as effective in its 'jaunty and jangling' approach stating:\n\nThe film is full of music, for instance, a loud, witty soundtrack by Masaru Sato, who said his main influence was Henry Mancini. It doesn\u2019t sound like Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s, though, or Days of Wine and Roses. The blaring Latin sound of Touch of Evil comes closer, but actually you wouldn\u2019t think of Mancini if you hadn\u2019t been told. Sato\u2019s effect has lots of drums, mixes traditional Japanese flutes and other instruments with American big band noises, and feels jaunty and jangling throughout, discreetly off, as if half the band was playing in the wrong key. It\u2019s distracting at first, then you realise it\u2019s not decoration, it\u2019s commentary. It\u2019s a companion to Sanjuro, the sound of his mind, discordant and undefeated and unserious, even when he\u2019s grubby and silent and apparently solemn.\n\nRelease\nYojimbo was released in Japan on 25 April 1961. The film was released by Seneca International in both a subtitled and dubbed format in the United States in September 1961.\n\nBox office\nYojimbo was Japan's fourth highest-grossing film of 1961, earning a distribution rental income of \u00a5351 million. This was equivalent to estimated box office gross receipts of approximately \u00a5659 million ($1.83 million).\nOverseas, the film had a September 1961 release in North America, but the box office income of this release is currently unknown. At the 2002 Kurosawa & Mifune Festival in the United States, the film grossed $561,692. In South Korea, a 2012 re-release grossed \u20a91.566 million ($1,390).\nIn Europe, a January 1991 limited French re-release sold 14,178 tickets, equivalent to an estimated gross revenue of approximately \u20ac63,801 ($87,934). Other limited European re-releases sold 3,392 tickets between 2000 and 2018, equivalent to an estimated gross revenue of at least \u20ac18,995 ($27,938). This adds up to an estimated $678,950 grossed overseas, and an estimated $2,508,950 grossed worldwide.\nAdjusted for ticket price inflation, at 2012 Japanese ticket prices, its Japanese gross receipts are equivalent to an estimated \u00a59.75 billion ($122 million), or $162 million adjusted for inflation in 2023. The overseas gross revenue of North American and European re-releases since 1991 are equivalent to approximately $1.5 million adjusted for inflation, adding up to an estimated inflation-adjusted total gross of over $137 million worldwide.\n\nCritical response\nYojimbo was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Costume Design at the 34th Academy Awards. Toshiro Mifune won the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the 22nd Venice Film Festival. \nA 1968 screening in the planned community of Columbia, Maryland was considered too violent for viewers, causing the hosts to hide in the bathroom to avoid the audience. \nIn a retrospective look at the film Michael Wood writing for the London Review of Books found the film to span several genres and compared it to other western and samurai films from the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, such as Seven Samurai, A Fistful of Dollars, High Noon, The Outlaw Josey Wales, and Rashomon, stating, \"(The film contains) comedy, satire, folk tale, action movie, Western, samurai film, and something like a musical without songs. As everyone says, this work is not as deep as Rashomon or as immediately memorable as Seven Samurai. But it is funnier than any Western from either side of the world, and its only competition, in a bleaker mode, would be Clint Eastwood\u2019s The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976).\" In 2009 the film was voted at No. 23 on the list of The Greatest Japanese Films of All Time by Japanese film magazine Kinema Junpo. Yojimbo was also ranked at #95 in Empire magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Films of All Time.\n\nSequel\nIn 1962, Kurosawa directed Sanjuro, originally intended to be a straight adaptation of Sh\u016bgor\u014d Yamamoto's short story Hibi Heian (\u65e5\u65e5\u5e73\u5b89, lit. \"Peaceful Days\"), but was reworked to include Mifune and his character following the success of Yojimbo.\nIn both films, he takes his surname from the plants he happens to be looking at when asked his name: in Yojimbo it is the mulberry trees that feed the town's silkworms, and in Sanjuro it is camellia bushes used to make tea.\n\nLegacy\nBoth in Japan and in the West, Yojimbo has had an influence on various forms of entertainment, starting with a  remake as A Fistful of Dollars (1964), a Spaghetti Western directed by Sergio Leone and starring Clint Eastwood in his first appearance as the Man with No Name. That film was followed by two prequels. The three films are collectively known as the Dollars Trilogy. Leone and his production company failed to secure the remake rights to Kurosawa's film, resulting in a lawsuit that delayed Fistful's release in North America for three years. It was settled out of court for an undisclosed agreement before the U.S. release. In Yojimbo, the protagonist defeats a man who carries a gun, while he carries only a knife and a sword; in the equivalent scene in A Fistful of Dollars, Eastwood's pistol-wielding character survives being shot by a rifle by hiding an iron plate under his clothes to serve as a shield against bullets.\nA second, looser Spaghetti Western adaptation, Django (1966), was directed by Sergio Corbucci and featured Franco Nero in the title role. Known for its high level (at the time of its release) of graphic violence, the film's character and title were referenced in two official films (a sequel and prequel) and over thirty unofficial ones.\nThe film Zatoichi Meets Yojimbo (1970) features Mifune as a somewhat similar character. It is the twentieth of a series of movies featuring the blind swordsman Zatoichi. Although Mifune is clearly not playing the same \"Yojimbo\" as he did in the two Kurosawa films (his name is Sasa Daisaku \u4f50\u3005\u5927\u4f5c, and his personality and background are different in many key respects), the movie's title and some of its content do intend to suggest the image of the two iconic jidaigeki characters confronting each other.\nIncident at Blood Pass (1970), made the same year, stars Mifune as a ronin who looks and acts even more similarly to Sanjuro and is referred to simply as \"Yojimbo\" throughout the film, but whose name is actually Shinogi T\u014dzabur\u014d. As was the case with Sanjuro, this character's surname of Shinogi (\u93ac) is not an actual proper family name, but rather a term that means \"ridges on a blade\".\nMifune's character became the model for John Belushi's Samurai Futaba character on Saturday Night Live.\nStar Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (1977) pays narrative and visual homage to Yojimbo during the cantina scene early in the film. When Luke Skywalker approaches the bar, he is accosted by Ponda Baba and Doctor Evazan, who like the gamblers confronting Sanjuro inform him of serious criminal penalties they have received elsewhere (death sentences in 12 jurisdictions) to intimidate him. Obi-Wan Kenobi intervenes just as they threaten Luke's life, and after he briefly wields his lightsaber the camera likewise shows a severed forearm on the floor to demonstrate the character's prowess with the weapon.\nSimilarly, Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017) was also heavily influenced by Yojimbo. In the film's third act, Luke Skywalker's attire is visually reminiscent to that of Sanjuro's, both characters are also framed in Wide shot and are portrayed as lone heroes with both having to deal with a larger threat by themselves, Sanjuro confronts Ushitora, Unosuke, and their gang while Luke confronts the entire First Order. During his showdown with Kylo Ren, Luke's last line is \"See you around, kid\", which recalls Sanjuro's last line, \"Aba yo\", meaning \"See you around\".\nThe Warrior and the Sorceress (1984) is another retelling of the story, this one in a fantasy world.\nLast Man Standing (1996) is a Prohibition-era action film directed by Walter Hill and starring Bruce Willis. It is an official remake of Yojimbo with both Kikushima and Kurosawa specifically listed in this movie's credits as having provided the original story.\nAt the closing of Episode XXIII (S02E10) of the animated series Samurai Jack (2002; S02), a triumphant Jack walks off alone in a scene (and accompanied by music) influenced by the closing scene and music of Yojimbo. In Episode XXVI (S02E13), Jack confronts a gang who destroyed his sandals, using Clint Eastwood's lines from A Fistful of Dollars, but substituting \"footwear\" for \"mule\". The influence of Yojimbo in particular (and Kurosawa films in general) on the animated series has been noted by Matthew Millheiser at DVDtalk.\nInferno (1999) (aka Desert Heat) is a remake and an homage to Yojimbo.\nStan Sakai's comic-book series Usagi Yojimbo (since 1984) is inspired by Kurosawa's movies.\n\nReferences\nNotes\n\nFootnotes\nSources\nExternal links\n\nYojimbo at IMDb\nYojimbo at AllMovie\nYojimbo at Box Office Mojo\nYojimbo at Rotten Tomatoes\nWest Meets East an essay by Alexander Sesonske at the Criterion Collection\nA Comparison of Yojimbo, A Fistful of Dollars and Last Man Standing\nYojimbo (in Japanese) at the Japanese Movie Database","249":"Yasujir\u014d Ozu (\u5c0f\u6d25 \u5b89\u4e8c\u90ce, Ozu Yasujir\u014d, 12 December 1903 \u2013 12 December 1963) was a Japanese filmmaker. He began his career during the era of silent films, and his last films were made in colour in the early 1960s. Ozu first made a number of short comedies, before turning to more serious themes in the 1930s.\nThe most prominent themes of Ozu's work are family and marriage, and especially the relationships between generations. His most widely beloved films include Late Spring (1949), Tokyo Story (1953) and An Autumn Afternoon (1962).\nWidely regarded as one of the world's greatest and most influential filmmakers, Ozu's work has continued to receive acclaim since his death. In the 2012 Sight & Sound poll, Ozu's Tokyo Story was voted the third-greatest film of all time by critics world-wide. In the same poll, Tokyo Story was voted the greatest film of all time by  358 directors and film-makers world-wide.\n\nBiography\nEarly life\nOzu was born in the Fukagawa district of Tokyo, the second son of merchant Toranosuke Ozu and his wife Asae. His family was a branch of the Ozu Yoemon merchant family from Ise, and Toranosuke was the 5th generation manager of the family's fertilizer business in Nihonbashi. Asae came from the Nakaj\u014d merchant family. Ozu had five brothers and sisters. When he was three, he developed meningitis, and was in a coma for a couple of days. Asae devoted herself to nursing him, and Ozu made a recovery. He attended Meiji nursery school and primary school. In March 1913, at the age of nine, he and his siblings were sent by his father to live in his father's home town of Matsusaka in Mie Prefecture, where he remained until 1924. In March 1916, at the age of 12, he entered what is now Ujiyamada High School. He was a boarder at the school and did judo. He frequently skipped classes to watch films such as Quo Vadis or The Last Days of Pompeii. In 1917, he saw the film Civilization and decided that he wanted to be a film director.\nIn 1920, at the age of 17, he was thrown out of the dormitory after being accused of writing a love letter to a good-looking boy in a lower class, and had to commute to school by train.\nIn March 1921, Ozu graduated from the high school. He attempted the exam for entrance into what is now Kobe University's economics department, but failed. In 1922, he took the exam for a teacher training college, but failed it too. On 31 March 1922, he began working as a substitute teacher at a school in Mie prefecture. He is said to have traveled the long journey from the school in the mountains to watch films on the weekend. In December 1922, his family, with the exception of Ozu and his sister, moved back to Tokyo to live with his father. In March 1923, when his sister graduated, he also returned to live in Tokyo.\n\nEntering the film business\nWith his uncle acting as intermediary, Ozu was hired by the Shochiku Film Company, as an assistant in the cinematography department, on 1 August 1923, against the wishes of his father. His family home was destroyed in the earthquake of 1923, but no members of his family were injured.\nOn 12 December 1924, Ozu started a year of military service. He finished his military service on 30 November 1925, leaving as a corporal.\nIn 1926, he became a third assistant director at Shochiku. In 1927, he was involved in a fracas where he punched another employee for jumping a queue at the studio cafeteria, and when called to the studio director's office, used it as an opportunity to present a film script he had written. In September 1927, he was promoted to director in the jidaigeki (period film) department, and directed his first film, Sword of Penitence, which has since been lost. Sword of Penitence was written by Ozu, with a screenplay by Kogo Noda, who would become his co-writer for the rest of his career. On September 25, he was called up for service in the military reserves until November, which meant that the film had to be partly finished by another director.\nIn 1928, Shiro Kido, the head of the Shochiku studio, decided that the company would concentrate on making short comedy films without star actors. Ozu made many of these films. The film Body Beautiful, released on 1 December 1928, was the first Ozu film to use a low camera position, which would become his trademark. After a series of the \"no star\" pictures, in September 1929, Ozu's first film with stars, I Graduated, But..., starring Minoru Takada and Kinuyo Tanaka, was released. In January 1930, he was entrusted with Shochiku's top star, Sumiko Kurishima, in her new year film, An Introduction to Marriage. His subsequent films of 1930 impressed Shiro Kido enough to invite Ozu on a trip to a hot spring. In his early works, Ozu used the pseudonym \"James Maki\" for his screenwriting credit. His film Young Miss, with an all-star cast, was the first time he used the pen name James Maki, and was also his first film to appear in film magazine Kinema Jumpo's \"Best Ten\" at third position.\nIn 1932, his I Was Born, But..., a comedy about childhood with serious overtones, was received by movie critics as the first notable work of social criticism in Japanese cinema, winning Ozu wide acclaim.\nIn 1935, Ozu made a short documentary with a soundtrack: Kagami Jishi, in which Kikugoro VI performed a Kabuki dance of the same title. This was made by request of the Ministry of Education.:\u200ap. 221\u200a Like the rest of Japan's cinema industry, Ozu was slow to switch to the production of talkies: his first film with a dialogue sound-track was The Only Son in 1936, five years after Japan's first talking film, Heinosuke Gosho's The Neighbor's Wife and Mine.\n\nWartime\nOn 9 September 1937, at a time when Shochiku was unhappy about Ozu's lack of box-office success, despite the praise he received from critics, the thirty-four-year-old Ozu was conscripted into the Imperial Japanese Army. He spent two years in China in the Second Sino-Japanese War. He arrived in Shanghai on 27 September 1937 as part of an infantry regiment which handled chemical weapons. He started as a corporal, but was promoted to sergeant on 1 June 1938. From January until September 1938, he was stationed in Nanjing, where he met Sadao Yamanaka, who was stationed nearby. In September, Yamanaka died of illness. In 1939, Ozu was dispatched to Hankou, where he fought in the Battle of Nanchang and the Battle of Xiushui River. In June, he was ordered back to Japan, arriving in Kobe in July, and his conscription ended on 16 July 1939.\nSome of Ozu's published diaries cover his wartime experiences between 20 December 1938 and 5 June 1939. Another diary from his wartime years (\u9663\u4e2d\u65e5\u8a18) he expressly forbade from publication. In the published diaries, reference to his group's participation in chemical warfare (in violation of the Geneva Protocol, though Japan had withdrawn from the League of Nations in 1933) can be found, for example, in various entries from March 1939. In other entries, he describes Chinese soldiers in disparaging terms, likening them in one passage to insects. Although operating as a military squad leader, Ozu retains his directorial perspective, once commenting that the initial shock and subsequent agony of a man as he is hacked to death is very much like its depiction in period films.\nOzu's writings also offers a glimpse into the Japanese military's use of comfort women. In a letter sent to friends in Japan on 11 April 1938, from Dingyuan County in China's Anhui Province, Ozu writes about the comfort station protocol in lightly coded terms. In a 13 January 1939 diary entry, Ozu writes more openly about his group's upcoming turn for use of a comfort station near Yingcheng. He mentions that two tickets, ointment and prophylatics are provided, and that three Korean and twelve Chinese women were being held at the comfort station for their use. Comfort station rates and schedules are also given by Ozu.\nIn 1939, he wrote the first draft of the script for The Flavor of Green Tea over Rice, but shelved it due to extensive changes insisted on by military censors. The first film Ozu made on his return was the critically and commercially successful Brothers and Sisters of the Toda Family, released in 1941. He followed this with There Was a Father (Chichi Ariki, 1942), which explored the strong bonds of affection between a father and son despite years of separation.\nIn 1943, Ozu was again drafted into the army for the purpose of making a propaganda film in Burma. However, he was sent to Singapore instead, to make a documentary Derii e, Derii e (\"To Delhi, to Delhi\") about Chandra Bose. During his time in Singapore, having little inclination to work, he spent an entire year reading, playing tennis and watching American films provided by the Army information corps. He was particularly impressed with Orson Welles's Citizen Kane. He occupied a fifth-floor room facing the sea in the Cathay Building where he entertained guests, drew pictures, and collected rugs. At the end of the Second World War, in August 1945, Ozu destroyed the script and all footage of the film. He was detained as a civilian, and worked in a rubber plantation. Of his film team of 32 people, there was only space for 28 on the first repatriation boat to Japan. Ozu won a lottery giving him a place, but gave it to someone else who was anxious to return.\n\nPostwar\nOzu returned to Japan in February 1946, and moved back in with his mother, who had been staying with his sister in Noda in Chiba prefecture. He reported for work at the Ofuna studios on 18 February 1946. His first film released after the war was Record of a Tenement Gentleman in 1947. Around this time, the Chigasakikan Ryokan became Ozu's favoured location for scriptwriting.\n\nTokyo Story was the last script that Ozu wrote at Chigasakikan. In later years, Ozu and Noda used a small house in the mountains at Tateshina in Nagano Prefecture called Unkos\u014d to write scripts, with Ozu staying in a nearby house called Mugeis\u014d.\nOzu's films from the late 1940s onward were favourably received, and the entries in the so-called \"Noriko trilogy\" (starring Setsuko Hara) of Late Spring (1949), Early Summer (1951) and Tokyo Story (1953) are among his most acclaimed works, with Tokyo Story widely considered his masterpiece. Late Spring, the first of these films, was the beginning of Ozu's commercial success and the development of his cinematography and storytelling style. These three films were followed by his first colour film, Equinox Flower, in 1958, Floating Weeds in 1959 and Late Autumn in 1960. In addition to Noda, other regular collaborators included cinematographer Yuharu Atsuta, along with the actors Chish\u016b Ry\u016b, Setsuko Hara and Haruko Sugimura.\nHis work was only rarely shown overseas before the 1960s; however, Tokyo Story gained recognition after winning the Sutherland Trophy at the 1958 London Film Festival. Ozu's last film was An Autumn Afternoon, which was released in 1962.\nHe served as president of the Directors Guild of Japan from 1955 until his death in 1963. In 1959 he became the first recipient from the field of cinema to win the Japan Art Academy Prize.\nOzu was known for his drinking. He and Noda measured the progression of their scripts by how many bottles of sake they had drunk. Ozu never married. He lived with his mother until she died in 1961.\nA heavy smoker, Ozu died of throat cancer in 1963 on his sixtieth birthday. The grave he shares with his mother at Engaku-ji in Kamakura bears no name\u2014just the character mu (\"nothingness\").\n\nLegacy and style\nOzu is probably as well known for the technical style and innovation of his films as for the narrative content. The style of his films is most striking in his later films, a style he had not fully developed until his post-war sound films. He did not conform to Hollywood conventions. Rather than using the typical over-the-shoulder shots in his dialogue scenes by most directors, the camera gazes on the actors directly, which has the effect of placing the viewer in the middle of the scene. Throughout his career, Ozu used a 50mm lens, which is usually considered to be the lens closest to human vision.\nOzu did not use typical transitions between scenes. In between scenes he would show shots of certain static objects as transitions, or use direct cuts, rather than fades or dissolves. Most often the static objects would be buildings, where the next indoor scene would take place. It was during these transitions that he would use music, which might begin at the end of one scene, progress through the static transition, and fade into the new scene. He rarely used non-diegetic music in any scenes other than in the transitions. Ozu moved the camera less and less as his career progressed, and ceased using tracking shots altogether in his colour films. However, David Bordwell argues that Ozu is one of the few directors to \"create a systematic alternative to Hollywood continuity cinema, but he does so by changing only a few premises.\"\nOzu invented the \"tatami shot\", in which the camera is placed at a low height, supposedly at the eye level of a person kneeling on a tatami mat. Actually, Ozu's camera is often even lower than that, only one or two feet off the ground, which necessitated the use of special tripods and raised sets. He used this low height even when there were no sitting scenes, such as when his characters walked in hallways. When Ozu made his move to colour, he chose to shoot under the German colour process Agfacolor, as he felt that it captured reds much better than any other colour process.\n\nOzu eschewed the traditional rules of movie storytelling, most notably eyelines. In his review of Floating Weeds, film critic Roger Ebert recounts:[Ozu] once had a young assistant who suggested that perhaps he should shoot conversations so that it seemed to the audience that the characters were looking at one another. Ozu agreed to a test. They shot a scene both ways, and compared them. \"You see?\" Ozu said. \"No difference!\"\nOzu was also an innovator in Japanese narrative structure through his use of ellipses, or the decision not to depict major events in the story. In An Autumn Afternoon (1962), for example, a wedding is merely mentioned in one scene, and the next sequence references this wedding (which has already occurred); the wedding itself is never shown. This is typical of Ozu's films, which eschew melodrama by eliding moments that would often be used in Hollywood in attempts to stir an emotional reaction from audiences.\nOzu became recognized internationally when his films were shown abroad. Influential monographs by Donald Richie, Paul Schrader, and David Bordwell have ensured a wide appreciation of Ozu's style, aesthetics, and themes by the Anglophonic audience.\n\nTributes and documentaries\nFive, also known as Five Dedicated to Ozu, is an Iranian documentary film directed by Abbas Kiarostami. The film consists of five long takes set by the ocean. \nFive sequences: 1) A piece of driftwood on the seashore, carried about by the waves 2) People walking on the seashore. The oldest ones stop by, look at the sea, then go away 3) Blurry shapes on a winter beach. A herd of dogs. A love story 4) A group of loud ducks cross the image, in one direction then the other 5) A pond, at night. Frogs improvising a concert. A storm, then the sunrise.\nIn 2003, the centenary of Ozu's birth was commemorated at various film festivals around the world. Shochiku produced the film Caf\u00e9 Lumi\u00e8re (\u73c8\u7432\u6642\u5149), directed by Taiwanese film-maker Hou Hsiao-hsien as homage to Ozu, with direct reference to the late master's Tokyo Story (1953), to premiere on Ozu's birthday.\nOzu was voted the tenth greatest director of all time in the 2002 British Film Institute's Sight & Sound poll of critics' top 10 directors. Ozu's Tokyo Story has appeared several times in the Sight & Sound poll of best films selected by critics and directors. In 2012, it topped the poll of film directors' choices of \"greatest film of all time\". Ozu was one of film critic Roger Ebert's favourite filmmakers, who described him as the most humanistic director of all time.\nIn 2013, director Yoji Yamada of the Otoko wa Tsurai yo film series remade Tokyo Story in a modern setting as Tokyo Family.\nIn the Wim Wenders documentary film Tokyo-Ga, the director travels to Japan to explore the world of Ozu, interviewing both Chish\u016b Ry\u016b and Yuharu Atsuta.\nIn 2023, OZU: Ozu Yasujir\u014d ga Kaita Monogatari (OZU\uff5e\u5c0f\u6d25\u5b89\u4e8c\u90ce\u304c\u63cf\u3044\u305f\u7269\u8a9e\uff5e), a 2023 television series based on Yasujir\u014d Ozu's several films premiered.\n\nFilmography\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\nBock, Audie (1978). \"Yasujiro Ozu\".

He is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and the \"Bard of Avon\" (or simply \"the Bard\"). His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. Shakespeare remains arguably the most influential writer in the English language, and his works continue to be studied and reinterpreted.\nShakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner (\"sharer\") of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men after the ascension of King James VI of Scotland to the English throne. At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs and even certain fringe theories as to whether the works attributed to him were written by others.\nShakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best works produced in these genres. He then wrote mainly tragedies until 1608, among them Hamlet, Othello, King Lear and Macbeth, all considered to be among the finest works in English. In the last phase of his life, he wrote tragicomedies (also known as romances) such as The Winter's Tale and The Tempest, and collaborated with other playwrights.\nMany of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime. However, in 1623, John Heminges and Henry Condell, two fellow actors and friends of Shakespeare's, published a more definitive text known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare's dramatic works that includes 36 of his plays. Its Preface was a prescient poem by Ben Jonson, a former rival of Shakespeare, who hailed Shakespeare with the now famous epithet: \"not of an age, but for all time\".\n\nLife\nEarly life\nShakespeare was the son of John Shakespeare, an alderman and a successful glover (glove-maker) originally from Snitterfield in Warwickshire, and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent landowning family. He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, where he was baptised on 26 April 1564. His date of birth is unknown but is traditionally observed on 23 April, Saint George's Day. This date, which can be traced to William Oldys and George Steevens, has proved appealing to biographers because Shakespeare died on the same date in 1616. He was the third of eight children, and the eldest surviving son.\nAlthough no attendance records for the period survive, most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the King's New School in Stratford, a free school chartered in 1553, about a quarter-mile (400 m) from his home. Grammar schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan era, but grammar school curricula were largely similar: the basic Latin text was standardised by royal decree, and the school would have provided an intensive education in grammar based upon Latin classical authors.\nAt the age of 18, Shakespeare married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway. The consistory court of the Diocese of Worcester issued a marriage licence on 27 November 1582. The next day, two of Hathaway's neighbours posted bonds guaranteeing that no lawful claims impeded the marriage. The ceremony may have been arranged in some haste since the Worcester chancellor allowed the marriage banns to be read once instead of the usual three times, and six months after the marriage Anne gave birth to a daughter, Susanna, baptised 26 May 1583. Twins, son Hamnet and daughter Judith, followed almost two years later and were baptised 2 February 1585. Hamnet died of unknown causes at the age of 11 and was buried 11 August 1596.\n\nAfter the birth of the twins, Shakespeare left few historical traces until he is mentioned as part of the London theatre scene in 1592. The exception is the appearance of his name in the \"complaints bill\" of a law case before the Queen's Bench court at Westminster dated Michaelmas Term 1588 and 9 October 1589. Scholars refer to the years between 1585 and 1592 as Shakespeare's \"lost years\". Biographers attempting to account for this period have reported many apocryphal stories. Nicholas Rowe, Shakespeare's first biographer, recounted a Stratford legend that Shakespeare fled the town for London to escape prosecution for deer poaching in the estate of local squire Thomas Lucy. Shakespeare is also supposed to have taken his revenge on Lucy by writing a scurrilous ballad about him. Another 18th-century story has Shakespeare starting his theatrical career minding the horses of theatre patrons in London. John Aubrey reported that Shakespeare had been a country schoolmaster. Some 20th-century scholars suggested that Shakespeare may have been employed as a schoolmaster by Alexander Hoghton of Lancashire, a Catholic landowner who named a certain \"William Shakeshafte\" in his will. Little evidence substantiates such stories other than hearsay collected after his death, and Shakeshafte was a common name in the Lancashire area.\n\nLondon and theatrical career\nIt is not known definitively when Shakespeare began writing, but contemporary allusions and records of performances show that several of his plays were on the London stage by 1592. By then, he was sufficiently known in London to be attacked in print by the playwright Robert Greene in his Groats-Worth of Wit from that year:\n\n... there is an upstart Crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his Tiger's heart wrapped in a Player's hide, supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blank verse as the best of you: and being an absolute Johannes factotum, is in his own conceit the only Shake-scene in a country.\nScholars differ on the exact meaning of Greene's words, but most agree that Greene was accusing Shakespeare of reaching above his rank in trying to match such university-educated writers as Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Nashe, and Greene himself (the so-called \"University Wits\"). The italicised phrase parodying the line \"Oh, tiger's heart wrapped in a woman's hide\" from Shakespeare's Henry VI, Part 3, along with the pun \"Shake-scene\", clearly identify Shakespeare as Greene's target. As used here, Johannes Factotum (\"Jack of all trades\") refers to a second-rate tinkerer with the work of others, rather than the more common \"universal genius\".\nGreene's attack is the earliest surviving mention of Shakespeare's work in the theatre. Biographers suggest that his career may have begun any time from the mid-1580s to just before Greene's remarks. After 1594, Shakespeare's plays were performed at The Theatre, in Shoreditch, only by the Lord Chamberlain's Men, a company owned by a group of players, including Shakespeare, that soon became the leading playing company in London. After the death of Queen Elizabeth in 1603, the company was awarded a royal patent by the new King James I, and changed its name to the King's Men.\n\nIn 1599, a partnership of members of the company built their own theatre on the south bank of the River Thames, which they named the Globe. In 1608, the partnership also took over the Blackfriars indoor theatre. Extant records of Shakespeare's property purchases and investments indicate that his association with the company made him a wealthy man, and in 1597, he bought the second-largest house in Stratford, New Place, and in 1605, invested in a share of the parish tithes in Stratford.\nSome of Shakespeare's plays were published in quarto editions, beginning in 1594, and by 1598, his name had become a selling point and began to appear on the title pages. Shakespeare continued to act in his own and other plays after his success as a playwright. The 1616 edition of Ben Jonson's Works names him on the cast lists for Every Man in His Humour (1598) and Sejanus His Fall (1603). The absence of his name from the 1605 cast list for Jonson's Volpone is taken by some scholars as a sign that his acting career was nearing its end. The First Folio of 1623, however, lists Shakespeare as one of \"the Principal Actors in all these Plays\", some of which were first staged after Volpone, although one cannot know for certain which roles he played. In 1610, John Davies of Hereford wrote that \"good Will\" played \"kingly\" roles. In 1709, Rowe passed down a tradition that Shakespeare played the ghost of Hamlet's father. Later traditions maintain that he also played Adam in As You Like It, and the Chorus in Henry V, though scholars doubt the sources of that information.\nThroughout his career, Shakespeare divided his time between London and Stratford. In 1596, the year before he bought New Place as his family home in Stratford, Shakespeare was living in the parish of St Helen's, Bishopsgate, north of the River Thames. He moved across the river to Southwark by 1599, the same year his company constructed the Globe Theatre there. By 1604, he had moved north of the river again, to an area north of St Paul's Cathedral with many fine houses. There, he rented rooms from a French Huguenot named Christopher Mountjoy, a maker of women's wigs and other headgear.\n\nLater years and death\nNicholas Rowe was the first biographer to record the tradition, repeated by Samuel Johnson, that Shakespeare retired to Stratford \"some years before his death\". He was still working as an actor in London in 1608; in an answer to the sharers' petition in 1635, Cuthbert Burbage stated that after purchasing the lease of the Blackfriars Theatre in 1608 from Henry Evans, the King's Men \"placed men players\" there, \"which were Heminges, Condell, Shakespeare, etc.\". However, it is perhaps relevant that the bubonic plague raged in London throughout 1609. The London public playhouses were repeatedly closed during extended outbreaks of the plague (a total of over 60 months closure between May 1603 and February 1610), which meant there was often no acting work. Retirement from all work was uncommon at that time. Shakespeare continued to visit London during the years 1611\u20131614. In 1612, he was called as a witness in Bellott v Mountjoy, a court case concerning the marriage settlement of Mountjoy's daughter, Mary. In March 1613, he bought a gatehouse in the former Blackfriars priory; and from November 1614, he was in London for several weeks with his son-in-law, John Hall. After 1610, Shakespeare wrote fewer plays, and none are attributed to him after 1613. His last three plays were collaborations, probably with John Fletcher, who succeeded him as the house playwright of the King's Men. He retired in 1613, before the Globe Theatre burned down during the performance of Henry VIII on 29 June.\nShakespeare died on 23 April 1616, at the age of 52. He died within a month of signing his will, a document which he begins by describing himself as being in \"perfect health\". No extant contemporary source explains how or why he died. Half a century later, John Ward, the vicar of Stratford, wrote in his notebook: \"Shakespeare, Drayton, and Ben Jonson had a merry meeting and, it seems, drank too hard, for Shakespeare died of a fever there contracted\", not an impossible scenario since Shakespeare knew Jonson and Drayton. Of the tributes from fellow authors, one refers to his relatively sudden death: \"We wondered, Shakespeare, that thou went'st so soon \/ From the world's stage to the grave's tiring room.\"\n\nHe was survived by his wife and two daughters. Susanna had married a physician, John Hall, in 1607, and Judith had married Thomas Quiney, a vintner, two months before Shakespeare's death. Shakespeare signed his last will and testament on 25 March 1616; the following day, Thomas Quiney, his new son-in-law, was found guilty of fathering an illegitimate son by Margaret Wheeler, both of whom had died during childbirth. Thomas was ordered by the church court to do public penance, which would have caused much shame and embarrassment for the Shakespeare family.\nShakespeare bequeathed the bulk of his large estate to his elder daughter Susanna under stipulations that she pass it down intact to \"the first son of her body\". The Quineys had three children, all of whom died without marrying. The Halls had one child, Elizabeth, who married twice but died without children in 1670, ending Shakespeare's direct line. Shakespeare's will scarcely mentions his wife, Anne, who was probably entitled to one-third of his estate automatically. He did make a point, however, of leaving her \"my second best bed\", a bequest that has led to much speculation. Some scholars see the bequest as an insult to Anne, whereas others believe that the second-best bed would have been the matrimonial bed and therefore rich in significance.\n\nShakespeare was buried in the chancel of the Holy Trinity Church two days after his death. The epitaph carved into the stone slab covering his grave includes a curse against moving his bones, which was carefully avoided during restoration of the church in 2008:\n\nSome time before 1623, a funerary monument was erected in his memory on the north wall, with a half-effigy of him in the act of writing. Its plaque compares him to Nestor, Socrates, and Virgil. In 1623, in conjunction with the publication of the First Folio, the Droeshout engraving was published. Shakespeare has been commemorated in many statues and memorials around the world, including funeral monuments in Southwark Cathedral and Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey.\n\nPlays\nMost playwrights of the period typically collaborated with others at some point, as critics agree Shakespeare did, mostly early and late in his career.\nThe first recorded works of Shakespeare are Richard III and the three parts of Henry VI, written in the early 1590s during a vogue for historical drama. Shakespeare's plays are difficult to date precisely, however, and studies of the texts suggest that Titus Andronicus, The Comedy of Errors, The Taming of the Shrew, and The Two Gentlemen of Verona may also belong to Shakespeare's earliest period. His first histories, which draw heavily on the 1587 edition of Raphael Holinshed's Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland, dramatise the destructive results of weak or corrupt rule and have been interpreted as a justification for the origins of the Tudor dynasty. The early plays were influenced by the works of other Elizabethan dramatists, especially Thomas Kyd and Christopher Marlowe, by the traditions of medieval drama, and by the plays of Seneca. The Comedy of Errors was also based on classical models, but no source for The Taming of the Shrew has been found, though it has an identical plot but different wording as another play with a similar name. Like The Two Gentlemen of Verona, in which two friends appear to approve of rape, the Shrew's story of the taming of a woman's independent spirit by a man sometimes troubles modern critics, directors, and audiences.\n\nShakespeare's early classical and Italianate comedies, containing tight double plots and precise comic sequences, give way in the mid-1590s to the romantic atmosphere of his most acclaimed comedies. A Midsummer Night's Dream is a witty mixture of romance, fairy magic, and comic lowlife scenes. Shakespeare's next comedy, the equally romantic The Merchant of Venice, contains a portrayal of the vengeful Jewish moneylender Shylock, which reflects dominant Elizabethan views but may appear derogatory to modern audiences. The wit and wordplay of Much Ado About Nothing, the charming rural setting of As You Like It, and the lively merrymaking of Twelfth Night complete Shakespeare's sequence of great comedies. After the lyrical Richard II, written almost entirely in verse, Shakespeare introduced prose comedy into the histories of the late 1590s, Henry IV, Part 1 and 2, and Henry V. Henry IV features Falstaff, rogue, wit and friend of Prince Hal. His characters become more complex and tender as he switches deftly between comic and serious scenes, prose and poetry, and achieves the narrative variety of his mature work. This period begins and ends with two tragedies: Romeo and Juliet, the famous romantic tragedy of sexually charged adolescence, love, and death; and Julius Caesar\u2014based on Sir Thomas North's 1579 translation of Plutarch's Parallel Lives\u2014which introduced a new kind of drama. According to Shakespearean scholar James Shapiro, in Julius Caesar, \"the various strands of politics, character, inwardness, contemporary events, even Shakespeare's own reflections on the act of writing, began to infuse each other\".\n\nIn the early 17th century, Shakespeare wrote the so-called \"problem plays\" Measure for Measure, Troilus and Cressida, and All's Well That Ends Well and a number of his best known tragedies. Many critics believe that Shakespeare's tragedies represent the peak of his art. Hamlet has probably been analysed more than any other Shakespearean character, especially for his famous soliloquy which begins \"To be or not to be; that is the question\". Unlike the introverted Hamlet, whose fatal flaw is hesitation, Othello and Lear are undone by hasty errors of judgement. The plots of Shakespeare's tragedies often hinge on such fatal errors or flaws, which overturn order and destroy the hero and those he loves. In Othello, Iago stokes Othello's sexual jealousy to the point where he murders the innocent wife who loves him. In King Lear, the old king commits the tragic error of giving up his powers, initiating the events which lead to the torture and blinding of the Earl of Gloucester and the murder of Lear's youngest daughter, Cordelia. According to the critic Frank Kermode, \"the play...offers neither its good characters nor its audience any relief from its cruelty\". In Macbeth, the shortest and most compressed of Shakespeare's tragedies, uncontrollable ambition incites Macbeth and his wife, Lady Macbeth, to murder the rightful king and usurp the throne until their own guilt destroys them in turn. In this play, Shakespeare adds a supernatural element to the tragic structure. His last major tragedies, Antony and Cleopatra and Coriolanus, contain some of Shakespeare's finest poetry and were considered his most successful tragedies by the poet and critic T. S. Eliot. Eliot wrote, \"Shakespeare acquired more essential history from Plutarch than most men could from the whole British Museum.\"\nIn his final period, Shakespeare turned to romance or tragicomedy and completed three more major plays: Cymbeline, The Winter's Tale, and The Tempest, as well as the collaboration, Pericles, Prince of Tyre. Less bleak than the tragedies, these four plays are graver in tone than the comedies of the 1590s, but they end with reconciliation and the forgiveness of potentially tragic errors. Some commentators have seen this change in mood as evidence of a more serene view of life on Shakespeare's part, but it may merely reflect the theatrical fashion of the day. Shakespeare collaborated on two further surviving plays, Henry VIII and The Two Noble Kinsmen, probably with John Fletcher.\n\nClassification\nShakespeare's works include the 36 plays printed in the First Folio of 1623, listed according to their folio classification as comedies, histories, and tragedies. Two plays not included in the First Folio, The Two Noble Kinsmen and Pericles, Prince of Tyre, are now accepted as part of the canon, with today's scholars agreeing that Shakespeare made major contributions to the writing of both. No Shakespearean poems were included in the First Folio.\nIn the late 19th century, Edward Dowden classified four of the late comedies as romances, and though many scholars prefer to call them tragicomedies, Dowden's term is often used. In 1896, Frederick S. Boas coined the term \"problem plays\" to describe four plays: All's Well That Ends Well, Measure for Measure, Troilus and Cressida, and Hamlet. \"Dramas as singular in theme and temper cannot be strictly called comedies or tragedies\", he wrote. \"We may, therefore, borrow a convenient phrase from the theatre of today and class them together as Shakespeare's problem plays.\" The term, much debated and sometimes applied to other plays, remains in use, though Hamlet is definitively classed as a tragedy.\n\nPerformances\nIt is not clear for which companies Shakespeare wrote his early plays. The title page of the 1594 edition of Titus Andronicus reveals that the play had been acted by three different troupes. After the plagues of 1592\u201393, Shakespeare's plays were performed by his own company at The Theatre and the Curtain in Shoreditch, north of the Thames. Londoners flocked there to see the first part of Henry IV, Leonard Digges recording, \"Let but Falstaff come, Hal, Poins, the rest ... and you scarce shall have a room\". When the company found themselves in dispute with their landlord, they pulled The Theatre down and used the timbers to construct the Globe Theatre, the first playhouse built by actors for actors, on the south bank of the Thames at Southwark. The Globe opened in autumn 1599, with Julius Caesar one of the first plays staged. Most of Shakespeare's greatest post-1599 plays were written for the Globe, including Hamlet, Othello, and King Lear.\n\nAfter the Lord Chamberlain's Men were renamed the King's Men in 1603, they entered a special relationship with the new King James. Although the performance records are patchy, the King's Men performed seven of Shakespeare's plays at court between 1 November 1604, and 31 October 1605, including two performances of The Merchant of Venice. After 1608, they performed at the indoor Blackfriars Theatre during the winter and the Globe during the summer. The indoor setting, combined with the Jacobean fashion for lavishly staged masques, allowed Shakespeare to introduce more elaborate stage devices. In Cymbeline, for example, Jupiter descends \"in thunder and lightning, sitting upon an eagle: he throws a thunderbolt. The ghosts fall on their knees.\"\nThe actors in Shakespeare's company included the famous Richard Burbage, William Kempe, Henry Condell and John Heminges. Burbage played the leading role in the first performances of many of Shakespeare's plays, including Richard III, Hamlet, Othello, and King Lear. The popular comic actor Will Kempe played the servant Peter in Romeo and Juliet and Dogberry in Much Ado About Nothing, among other characters. He was replaced around 1600 by Robert Armin, who played roles such as Touchstone in As You Like It and the fool in King Lear. In 1613, Sir Henry Wotton recorded that Henry VIII \"was set forth with many extraordinary circumstances of pomp and ceremony\". On 29 June, however, a cannon set fire to the thatch of the Globe and burned the theatre to the ground, an event which pinpoints the date of a Shakespeare play with rare precision.\n\nTextual sources\nIn 1623, John Heminges and Henry Condell, two of Shakespeare's friends from the King's Men, published the First Folio, a collected edition of Shakespeare's plays. It contained 36 texts, including 18 printed for the first time. The others had already appeared in quarto versions\u2014flimsy books made from sheets of paper folded twice to make four leaves. No evidence suggests that Shakespeare approved these editions, which the First Folio describes as \"stol'n and surreptitious copies\".\nAlfred Pollard termed some of the pre-1623 versions as \"bad quartos\" because of their adapted, paraphrased or garbled texts, which may in places have been reconstructed from memory. Where several versions of a play survive, each differs from the others. The differences may stem from copying or printing errors, from notes by actors or audience members, or from Shakespeare's own papers. In some cases, for example, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida, and Othello, Shakespeare could have revised the texts between the quarto and folio editions. In the case of King Lear, however, while most modern editions do conflate them, the 1623 folio version is so different from the 1608 quarto that the Oxford Shakespeare prints them both, arguing that they cannot be conflated without confusion.\n\nPoems\nIn 1593 and 1594, when the theatres were closed because of plague, Shakespeare published two narrative poems on sexual themes, Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece. He dedicated them to Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton. In Venus and Adonis, an innocent Adonis rejects the sexual advances of Venus; while in The Rape of Lucrece, the virtuous wife Lucrece is raped by the lustful Tarquin. Influenced by Ovid's Metamorphoses, the poems show the guilt and moral confusion that result from uncontrolled lust. Both proved popular and were often reprinted during Shakespeare's lifetime. A third narrative poem, A Lover's Complaint, in which a young woman laments her seduction by a persuasive suitor, was printed in the first edition of the Sonnets in 1609. Most scholars now accept that Shakespeare wrote A Lover's Complaint. Critics consider that its fine qualities are marred by leaden effects. The Phoenix and the Turtle, printed in Robert Chester's 1601 Love's Martyr, mourns the deaths of the legendary phoenix and his lover, the faithful turtle dove. In 1599, two early drafts of sonnets 138 and 144 appeared in The Passionate Pilgrim, published under Shakespeare's name but without his permission.\n\nSonnets\nPublished in 1609, the Sonnets were the last of Shakespeare's non-dramatic works to be printed. Scholars are not certain when each of the 154 sonnets was composed, but evidence suggests that Shakespeare wrote sonnets throughout his career for a private readership. Even before the two unauthorised sonnets appeared in The Passionate Pilgrim in 1599, Francis Meres had referred in 1598 to Shakespeare's \"sugred Sonnets among his private friends\". Few analysts believe that the published collection follows Shakespeare's intended sequence. He seems to have planned two contrasting series: one about uncontrollable lust for a married woman of dark complexion (the \"dark lady\"), and one about conflicted love for a fair young man (the \"fair youth\"). It remains unclear if these figures represent real individuals, or if the authorial \"I\" who addresses them represents Shakespeare himself, though Wordsworth believed that with the sonnets \"Shakespeare unlocked his heart\".\n\nThe 1609 edition was dedicated to a \"Mr. W.H.\", credited as \"the only begetter\" of the poems. It is not known whether this was written by Shakespeare himself or by the publisher, Thomas Thorpe, whose initials appear at the foot of the dedication page; nor is it known who Mr. W.H. was, despite numerous theories, or whether Shakespeare even authorised the publication. Critics praise the Sonnets as a profound meditation on the nature of love, sexual passion, procreation, death, and time.\n\nStyle\nShakespeare's first plays were written in the conventional style of the day. He wrote them in a stylised language that does not always spring naturally from the needs of the characters or the drama. The poetry depends on extended, sometimes elaborate metaphors and conceits, and the language is often rhetorical\u2014written for actors to declaim rather than speak. The grand speeches in Titus Andronicus, in the view of some critics, often hold up the action, for example; and the verse in The Two Gentlemen of Verona has been described as stilted.\n\nHowever, Shakespeare soon began to adapt the traditional styles to his own purposes. The opening soliloquy of Richard III has its roots in the self-declaration of Vice in medieval drama. At the same time, Richard's vivid self-awareness looks forward to the soliloquies of Shakespeare's mature plays. No single play marks a change from the traditional to the freer style. Shakespeare combined the two throughout his career, with Romeo and Juliet perhaps the best example of the mixing of the styles. By the time of Romeo and Juliet, Richard II, and A Midsummer Night's Dream in the mid-1590s, Shakespeare had begun to write a more natural poetry. He increasingly tuned his metaphors and images to the needs of the drama itself.\nShakespeare's standard poetic form was blank verse, composed in iambic pentameter. In practice, this meant that his verse was usually unrhymed and consisted of ten syllables to a line, spoken with a stress on every second syllable. The blank verse of his early plays is quite different from that of his later ones. It is often beautiful, but its sentences tend to start, pause, and finish at the end of lines, with the risk of monotony. Once Shakespeare mastered traditional blank verse, he began to interrupt and vary its flow. This technique releases the new power and flexibility of the poetry in plays such as Julius Caesar and Hamlet. Shakespeare uses it, for example, to convey the turmoil in Hamlet's mind:\n\nAfter Hamlet, Shakespeare varied his poetic style further, particularly in the more emotional passages of the late tragedies. The literary critic A. C. Bradley described this style as \"more concentrated, rapid, varied, and, in construction, less regular, not seldom twisted or elliptical\". In the last phase of his career, Shakespeare adopted many techniques to achieve these effects. These included run-on lines, irregular pauses and stops, and extreme variations in sentence structure and length. In Macbeth, for example, the language darts from one unrelated metaphor or simile to another: \"was the hope drunk\/ Wherein you dressed yourself?\" (1.7.35\u201338); \"... pity, like a naked new-born babe\/ Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, hors'd\/ Upon the sightless couriers of the air ...\" (1.7.21\u201325). The listener is challenged to complete the sense. The late romances, with their shifts in time and surprising turns of plot, inspired a last poetic style in which long and short sentences are set against one another, clauses are piled up, subject and object are reversed, and words are omitted, creating an effect of spontaneity.\nShakespeare combined poetic genius with a practical sense of the theatre. Like all playwrights of the time, he dramatised stories from sources such as Plutarch and Holinshed. He reshaped each plot to create several centres of interest and to show as many sides of a narrative to the audience as possible. This strength of design ensures that a Shakespeare play can survive translation, cutting, and wide interpretation without loss to its core drama. As Shakespeare's mastery grew, he gave his characters clearer and more varied motivations and distinctive patterns of speech. He preserved aspects of his earlier style in the later plays, however. In Shakespeare's late romances, he deliberately returned to a more artificial style, which emphasised the illusion of theatre.\n\nLegacy\nInfluence\nShakespeare's work has made a significant and lasting impression on later theatre and literature. In particular, he expanded the dramatic potential of characterisation, plot, language, and genre. Until Romeo and Juliet, for example, romance had not been viewed as a worthy topic for tragedy. Soliloquies had been used mainly to convey information about characters or events, but Shakespeare used them to explore characters' minds. His work heavily influenced later poetry. The Romantic poets attempted to revive Shakespearean verse drama, though with little success. Critic George Steiner described all English verse dramas from Coleridge to Tennyson as \"feeble variations on Shakespearean themes.\" John Milton, considered by many to be the most important English poet after Shakespeare, wrote in tribute: \"Thou in our wonder and astonishment\/ Hast built thyself a live-long monument.\"\nShakespeare influenced novelists such as Thomas Hardy, William Faulkner, and Charles Dickens. The American novelist Herman Melville's soliloquies owe much to Shakespeare; his Captain Ahab in Moby-Dick is a classic tragic hero, inspired by King Lear. Scholars have identified 20,000 pieces of music linked to Shakespeare's works, including Felix Mendelssohn's overture and incidental music for A Midsummer Night's Dream and Sergei Prokofiev's ballet Romeo and Juliet. His work has inspired several operas, among them Giuseppe Verdi's Macbeth, Otello and Falstaff, whose critical standing compares with that of the source plays. Shakespeare has also inspired many painters, including the Romantics and the Pre-Raphaelites, while William Hogarth's 1745 painting of actor David Garrick playing Richard III was decisive in establishing the genre of theatrical portraiture in Britain. The Swiss Romantic artist Henry Fuseli, a friend of William Blake, even translated Macbeth into German. The psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud drew on Shakespearean psychology, in particular, that of Hamlet, for his theories of human nature. Shakespeare has been a rich source for filmmakers; Akira Kurosawa adapted Macbeth and King Lear as Throne of Blood and Ran, respectively. Other examples of Shakespeare on film include Max Reinhardt's A Midsummer Night's Dream, Laurence Olivier's Hamlet and Al Pacino's documentary Looking For Richard. Orson Welles, a lifelong lover of Shakespeare, directed and starred in Macbeth, Othello and Chimes at Midnight, in which he plays John Falstaff, which Welles himself called his best work.\nIn Shakespeare's day, English grammar, spelling, and pronunciation were less standardised than they are now, and his use of language helped shape modern English. Samuel Johnson quoted him more often than any other author in his A Dictionary of the English Language, the first serious work of its type. Expressions such as \"with bated breath\" (Merchant of Venice) and \"a foregone conclusion\" (Othello) have found their way into everyday English speech.\nShakespeare's influence extends far beyond his native England and the English language. His reception in Germany was particularly significant; as early as the 18th century Shakespeare was widely translated and popularised in Germany, and gradually became a \"classic of the German Weimar era;\" Christoph Martin Wieland was the first to produce complete translations of Shakespeare's plays in any language. Actor and theatre director Simon Callow writes, \"this master, this titan, this genius, so profoundly British and so effortlessly universal, each different culture \u2013 German, Italian, Russian \u2013 was obliged to respond to the Shakespearean example; for the most part, they embraced it, and him, with joyous abandon, as the possibilities of language and character in action that he celebrated liberated writers across the continent. Some of the most deeply affecting productions of Shakespeare have been non-English, and non-European. He is that unique writer: he has something for everyone.\"\nAccording to Guinness World Records, Shakespeare remains the world's best-selling playwright, with sales of his plays and poetry believed to have achieved in excess of four billion copies in the almost 400 years since his death. He is also the third most translated author in history.\n\nCritical reputation\nShakespeare was not revered in his lifetime, but he received a large amount of praise. In 1598, the cleric and author Francis Meres singled him out from a group of English playwrights as \"the most excellent\" in both comedy and tragedy. The authors of the Parnassus plays at St John's College, Cambridge, numbered him with Chaucer, Gower, and Spenser. In the First Folio, Ben Jonson called Shakespeare the \"Soul of the age, the applause, delight, the wonder of our stage\", although he had remarked elsewhere that \"Shakespeare wanted art\" (lacked skill).\nBetween the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 and the end of the 17th century, classical ideas were in vogue. As a result, critics of the time mostly rated Shakespeare below John Fletcher and Ben Jonson. Thomas Rymer, for example, condemned Shakespeare for mixing the comic with the tragic. Nevertheless, poet and critic John Dryden rated Shakespeare highly, saying of Jonson, \"I admire him, but I love Shakespeare\". He also famously remarked that Shakespeare \"was naturally learned; he needed not the spectacles of books to read nature; he looked inwards, and found her there.\" For several decades, Rymer's view held sway. But during the 18th century, critics began to respond to Shakespeare on his own terms and, like Dryden, to acclaim what they termed his natural genius. A series of scholarly editions of his work, notably those of Samuel Johnson in 1765 and Edmond Malone in 1790, added to his growing reputation. By 1800, he was firmly enshrined as the national poet, and described as the \"Bard of Avon\" (or simply \"the Bard\"). In the 18th and 19th centuries, his reputation also spread abroad. Among those who championed him were the writers Voltaire, Goethe, Stendhal, and Victor Hugo.\n\nDuring the Romantic era, Shakespeare was praised by the poet and literary philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and the critic August Wilhelm Schlegel translated his plays in the spirit of German Romanticism. In the 19th century, critical admiration for Shakespeare's genius often bordered on adulation. \"This King Shakespeare,\" the essayist Thomas Carlyle wrote in 1840, \"does not he shine, in crowned sovereignty, over us all, as the noblest, gentlest, yet strongest of rallying signs; indestructible\". The Victorians produced his plays as lavish spectacles on a grand scale. The playwright and critic George Bernard Shaw mocked the cult of Shakespeare worship as \"bardolatry\", claiming that the new naturalism of Ibsen's plays had made Shakespeare obsolete.\nThe modernist revolution in the arts during the early 20th century, far from discarding Shakespeare, eagerly enlisted his work in the service of the avant-garde. The Expressionists in Germany and the Futurists in Moscow mounted productions of his plays. Marxist playwright and director Bertolt Brecht devised an epic theatre under the influence of Shakespeare. The poet and critic T. S. Eliot argued against Shaw that Shakespeare's \"primitiveness\" in fact made him truly modern. Eliot, along with G. Wilson Knight and the school of New Criticism, led a movement towards a closer reading of Shakespeare's imagery. In the 1950s, a wave of new critical approaches replaced modernism and paved the way for post-modern studies of Shakespeare. Comparing Shakespeare's accomplishments to those of leading figures in philosophy and theology, Harold Bloom wrote, \"Shakespeare was larger than Plato and than St. Augustine. He encloses us because we see with his fundamental perceptions.\"\n\nSpeculation\nAuthorship\nAround 230 years after Shakespeare's death, doubts began to be expressed about the authorship of the works attributed to him. Proposed alternative candidates include Francis Bacon, Christopher Marlowe, and Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford. Several \"group theories\" have also been proposed. All but a few Shakespeare scholars and literary historians consider it a fringe theory, with only a small minority of academics who believe that there is reason to question the traditional attribution, but interest in the subject, particularly the Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship, continues into the 21st century.\n\nReligion\nShakespeare conformed to the official state religion, but his private views on religion have been the subject of debate. Shakespeare's will uses a Protestant formula, and he was a confirmed member of the Church of England, where he was married, his children were baptised, and where he is buried. \nSome scholars are of the view that members of Shakespeare's family were Catholics, at a time when practising Catholicism in England was against the law. Shakespeare's mother, Mary Arden, certainly came from a pious Catholic family. The strongest evidence might be a Catholic statement of faith signed by his father, John Shakespeare, found in 1757 in the rafters of his former house in Henley Street. However, the document is now lost and scholars differ as to its authenticity. In 1591, the authorities reported that John Shakespeare had missed church \"for fear of process for debt\", a common Catholic excuse. In 1606, the name of William's daughter Susanna appears on a list of those who failed to attend Easter communion in Stratford. \nOther authors argue that there is a lack of evidence about Shakespeare's religious beliefs. Scholars find evidence both for and against Shakespeare's Catholicism, Protestantism, or lack of belief in his plays, but the truth may be impossible to prove.\n\nSexuality\nFew details of Shakespeare's sexuality are known. At 18, he married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway, who was pregnant. Susanna, the first of their three children, was born six months later on 26 May 1583. Over the centuries, some readers have posited that Shakespeare's sonnets are autobiographical, and point to them as evidence of his love for a young man. Others read the same passages as the expression of intense friendship rather than romantic love. The 26 so-called \"Dark Lady\" sonnets, addressed to a married woman, are taken as evidence of heterosexual liaisons.\n\nPortraiture\nNo written contemporary description of Shakespeare's physical appearance survives, and no evidence suggests that he ever commissioned a portrait. From the 18th century, the desire for authentic Shakespeare portraits fuelled claims that various surviving pictures depicted Shakespeare. That demand also led to the production of several fake portraits, as well as misattributions, re-paintings, and relabelling of portraits of other people. \nSome scholars suggest that the Droeshout portrait, which Ben Jonson approved of as a good likeness, and his Stratford monument provide perhaps the best evidence of his appearance. Of the claimed paintings, art historian Tarnya Cooper concluded that the Chandos portrait (shown at the top of this article) had \"the strongest claim of any of the known contenders to be a true portrait of Shakespeare\". After a three-year study supported by the National Portrait Gallery, London, the portrait's owners, Cooper contended that its composition date, contemporary with Shakespeare, its subsequent provenance, and the sitter's attire, all supported the attribution.\n\nSee also\nOutline of William Shakespeare\nEnglish Renaissance theatre\nSpelling of Shakespeare's name\nWorld Shakespeare Bibliography\nShakespeare's Politics\n\nReferences\nNotes\nCitations\nSources\nBooks\n\nArticles and online\n\nExternal links\n\nDigital editions\nWilliam Shakespeare's plays on Bookwise\nInternet Shakespeare Editions\nThe Folger Shakespeare\nOpen Source Shakespeare complete works, with search engine and concordance\nThe Shakespeare Quartos Archive\nWorks by William Shakespeare in eBook form at Standard Ebooks\nWorks by William Shakespeare at Project Gutenberg\nWorks by or about William Shakespeare at the Internet Archive\nWorks by William Shakespeare at LibriVox (public domain audiobooks) \nExhibitions\nShakespeare Documented an online exhibition documenting Shakespeare in his own time\nShakespeare's Will from The National Archives\nThe Shakespeare Birthplace Trust\nWilliam Shakespeare Archived 23 September 2021 at the Wayback Machine at the British Library\nMusic\nWorks by William Shakespeare set to music: free scores in the Choral Public Domain Library (ChoralWiki)\nWorks by William Shakespeare set to music: Scores at the International Music Score Library Project\nEducation\n\nShakespeare at Home an online resource providing free educational resources on William Shakespeare and the Renaissance world.

It takes its title from a gramophone recording of Pablo de Sarasate's violin composition, Zigeunerweisen, which features prominently in the story. The film makes the first part of Suzuki's Taish\u014d Roman Trilogy, followed by Kagero-za (1981) and Yumeji (1991), surrealistic psychological dramas and ghost stories linked by style, themes and the Taish\u014d period (1912-1926) setting. All three were produced by Genjiro Arato.\nWhen exhibitors declined to screen the film, Arato screened it himself in an inflatable, mobile tent to great success. It won Honourable Mention at the 31st Berlin International Film Festival, was nominated for nine Japanese Academy Awards and won four, including best director and best film, and was voted the number one Japanese film of the 1980s by Japanese critics.\n\nPlot\nVacationing in a small seaside village, Aochi, a professor of German language, runs into Nakasago, a former colleague turned nomad. Nakasago is being pursued by an angry mob for allegedly seducing and killing a fisherman's wife. The two catch up over dinner where they are entertained by and become smitten with the mourning geisha Koine. Six months later, Aochi visits Nakasago to find that he has settled down and is having a child with Sono, a woman who bears a remarkable resemblance to Koine. Nakasago plays him a recording of Zigeunerweisen and they discuss inaudible mumbling on the record. Nakasago suddenly takes to the road again with Koine, leaving Sono to birth their child alone. Both men enter affairs with the other's wife. Nakasago suggests to Aochi that whoever outlives the other should get the other's bones. Sono later dies of the flu and is replaced by Koine as a surrogate mother. Nakasago takes to the road yet again. Aochi learns of Nakasago's death in a landslide. Years later, Koine visits Aochi and requests the return of the Zigeunerweisen record but he is sure he never borrowed it. When his wife reveals the record, he rushes over to deliver it to Koine. Koine explains that her daughter, Toyoko, talks in her sleep about Nakasago. On his way home, Aochi encounters Toyoko, who demands his bones.\n\nCast\nYoshio Harada as Nakasago\nNaoko Otani as Koine\/Sono\nToshiya Fujita as Aochi\nMichiyo Okusu as Shuko, Aochi's wife\nKisako Makishi as Taeko\nKirin Kiki as Kimi\nAkaji Maro as Blind Man\nSumie Sasaki as Maid in a hotel\nIsao Tamagawa as Doctor Amaki\nHatsuo Yamaya as a Policeman\n\nProduction\nDirector Seijun Suzuki was ostensibly terminated from his contract with Nikkatsu Studios in 1968 for making \"movies that make no sense and no money\" and subsequently blacklisted. In the proceeding years he met frequently with his crew at his home in developing ideas for new projects. This resulted in Zigeunerweisen and Kagero-za\u2014the first two films in what would become Suzuki's Taish\u014d Roman Trilogy. Suzuki felt that action films were falling out of favour and wanted to create a new type of film. Writer Y\u014dz\u014d Tanaka lived close by and visited Suzuki regularly where they infrequently discussed the film during games of Go. The story was based on Hyakken Uchida's novel, Disk of Sarasate. It was felt to be too short and was expanded from their conversations. For example, when Tanaka's uncle died during that time, he noticed that his cremated bones were pink. This was incorporated into the screenplay.\nSuzuki's de facto blacklisting ended with the release of his critically and commercially unsuccessful 1977 film A Tale of Sorrow and Sadness. The money to finance Zigeunerweisen only became available in 1979 when Suzuki met then\u2013theatre producer Genjiro Arato. Thus it became their first fully independently produced film. It was shot on location in Japan.\n\nStyle and themes\nZigeunerweisen is a departure from director Suzuki Seijun's Nikkatsu films in many ways. It was shot entirely on location without access to studio resources; it runs 144 minutes, in contrast to the former's 90-minute maximum; and its intellectual characters and period setting and subject matter invited a more literary audience as opposed to the younger genre fans that formed Suzuki's cult following. On the other hand, freed of studio constraints, Suzuki was able to carry his style even further in the direction his genre work had taken and abandon traditional narrative entirely in favour of random occurrences and incongruous and misleading associations. He presents, comments on and challenges the conceptions of the Taish\u014d era, specifically the wide introduction and assimilation of Western culture into Japan and its effect on the Japanese identity.\n\nReleases and reception\nProducer Genjiro Arato was unable to procure exhibitors for Zigeunerweisen and exhibited the film himself with his company Cinema Placet in a specially-built, inflatable, mobile tent. The film was initially screened beside the Tokyo Dome on April 1, 1980. The film was an immediate success and was quickly picked up for a wide release. In its 22-week run it sold 56 000 seats, where 10 000 was generally considered a success for an independent film. Critics named Zigeunerweisen the \"must-see\" film of 1980, it garnered four Japanese Academy Awards and reignited Suzuki's career. Little More Co. re-released the full Taish\u014d Roman Trilogy theatrically on April 28, 2001, in the Deep Seijun retrospective. In conjunction they released the trilogy on DVD (without English subtitles), marking its debut on home video.\nThe film was not distributed internationally but did appear in film festivals and retrospectives. It was screened in competition at the 31st Berlin International Film Festival and appeared in the first British retrospective of Suzuki's films at the 1988 Edinburgh International Film Festival. In North American, Kino International released a DVD edition of the film on March 7, 2006. It features a 25-minute interview with Suzuki discussing the making of the Taish\u014d Roman Trilogy, a biography and filmography of the same, the theatrical trailer and a gallery of promotional material and photographs. The DVD is also available in a box set encompassing the trilogy.\n\nAwards\nZigeunerweisen received nine nominations at the 1981 Japanese Academy Awards and won in four categories, Best Film, Suzuki won for Best Director, Takeo Kimura for Best Art Director and Michiyo Okusu for Best Supporting Actress. Also nominated were Naoko Otani for Best Actress, Toshiya Fujita for Best Supporting Actor, Y\u014dz\u014d Tanaka for Best Screenplay, Kazue Nagatsuka for Best Cinematography and Mitsuo Onishi for Best Lighting.\nAt the Kinema Junpo Awards, it duplicated the same four wins plus a fifth Best Actress award for Naoko Otani. At the Yokohama Film Festival it won Best Film, Director and Cinematographer. Further prizes include the Blue Ribbon Awards (Best Director), Hochi Film Awards (Special Award) and the Mainichi Film Concurs (Best Screenplay and Best Cinematographer).
