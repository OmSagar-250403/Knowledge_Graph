Pacific Coast Highway in Pacific Palisades east to Figueroa Street in Downtown Los Angeles. It is a major thoroughfare in the cities of Beverly Hills and West Hollywood (including a portion known as the Sunset Strip), as well as several districts in Los Angeles.\n\nGeography\nApproximately 23.6 miles (38 km) in length, the boulevard roughly traces the arc of mountains that form part of the northern boundary of the Los Angeles Basin, following the path of a 1780s cattle trail from the Pueblo de Los Angeles to the ocean.\nFrom Downtown Los Angeles, the boulevard heads northwest, to Hollywood, through which it travels due west for several miles before it bends southwest towards the ocean. It passes through or near Echo Park, Silver Lake, Los Feliz, Hollywood, West Hollywood, Beverly Hills, and Holmby Hills. In Bel-Air, Sunset Boulevard runs along the northern boundary of UCLA's Westwood campus. The boulevard continues through Brentwood to Pacific Palisades, where it terminates at the Pacific Coast Highway intersection.\nThe boulevard has curvaceous winding stretches, and can be treacherous for unalert drivers in some sections. Sunset Boulevard is at least four lanes wide along its entire route. Sunset is frequently congested with traffic loads beyond its design capacity.\nSunset Boulevard historically extended farther east than it does now, starting at Alameda Street near Union Station and beside Olvera Street in the historic section of Downtown. The portion of Sunset Boulevard east of Figueroa Street was renamed Cesar Chavez Avenue in 1994, along with Macy Street and Brooklyn Avenue, in honor of the late Mexican-American union leader and civil rights activist.\n\nHistory\nIn 1877, Harvey Henderson Wilcox, one of the earlier real estate owners from \"back East\", decided to subdivide more than 20 acres (8.1 ha) of land (mostly orchards and vineyards) along Sunset Boulevard, including what is today Hollywood and Vine.\nIn 1890, Belgian diplomat Victor Ponet bought 240 acres (97 ha) of the former Rancho La Brea land grant. His son-in-law, Francis S. Montgomery, inherited this property and created Sunset Plaza.\nAccording to a 1901 article in the Los Angeles Herald, Sunset only extended from Hollywood in the west to Marion Avenue in the Echo Park district in the east. The Board of Public Works proposed to extend Sunset east to Main Street in the Plaza by routing the road over the existing section of Bellevue Avenue, but the plan was delayed until approximately 1904, due to active opposition by affected land owners. According to the 1910 Baist Real Estate Survey Atlas, Sunset Boulevard reached the Plaza by that time, but it did so by two short and narrow segments which were not aligned with each other and thus did not provide a proper thoroughfare to it. In late 1912, several properties along the route were condemned so that the boulevard could be changed in both its width and its alignment. With these changes completed, Sunset Boulevard now reached North Main Street and continued as Marchessault along the northern end of the Plaza. This section, variously marked and signed as Marchessault Street or East Sunset Boulevard, remained open to traffic until the late 1960s or early 1970s. At that time, Sunset was realigned one block north and Marchessault was closed to motor traffic.\nIn 1921 a westward expansion of Sunset began, extending the road from the then-current terminus at Sullivan Canyon toward the coast. This land, a portion of the original 1838 holdings of Francisco Marquez, stretched across a mesa and became known as the \"Riviera section\". Will Rogers, who had bought much of this land as an investment, later donated it to the State of California creating Will Rogers State Historic Park.  c.\u20091931, Sunset was a paved road from Horn Avenue to Havenhurst Avenue.\n\nCultural aspects\nThe Sunset Strip portion of Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood has been famous for its active nightlife since at least the 1950s.\nIn contrast to other American cities where it referred to a concentration of radio retailers, in Los Angeles, Radio Row was understood in the 1940s\u20131950s as the area around the intersection of Sunset Boulevard and Vine Street in Hollywood, where the broadcasting facilities of all four major radio networks were located.\nIn the 1970s, the area between Gardner Street and Western Avenue was a center for street prostitution. Shortly after a much publicized incident in late June 1995, police raids drove out the majority of prostitutes on the Boulevard.\nPart of Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood is also sometimes called \"Guitar Row\" due to the large number of guitar stores and music industry-related businesses, including the recording studios Sunset Sound Studios and United Western Recorders.\nThe portion of Sunset Boulevard that passes through Beverly Hills was once named Beverly Boulevard.\nThe boulevard is commemorated in Billy Wilder's film Sunset Boulevard (1950), the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical of the same name, and the 1950s television series 77 Sunset Strip. Jan and Dean's 1960s hit song \"Dead Man's Curve\" refers to a section of the road near Bel Air estates just north of UCLA's Drake Stadium where Jan Berry almost died in an automobile accident in 1966. The Buffalo Springfield song \"For What It's Worth\" was written about a riot at Pandora's Box, a Sunset Strip club, in 1966.\nMetro Local lines 2, 4 and 602 operate on Sunset Boulevard, with Line 2 running through most of Sunset Boulevard between Echo Park and UCLA, Line 4 between Sunset Junction and Downtown LA, and Line 602 from UCLA west. The Metro B Line operates a subway station at Vermont Avenue.\nAt 4334 W. Sunset Boulevard lies the wall featured on the cover of the late singer-songwriter Elliott Smith's 2000 album Figure 8. Since Smith's death in 2003, the wall has become a memorial for the artist; fans have left many personal messages there over the years.\n\nLandmarks (past and present)\nSee also\nSunset Boulevard (film) (1950)\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nLibman, Gary (December 18, 1988). \"Street of Contrasts in a Changing L.A. : Sunset Boulevard: Epitome of L.A. : As It Winds From Plaza to Ocean, Diversity Is Its Name\".

The west end is in downtown Beverly Hills by Santa Monica Boulevard, and the east is at Alameda Street in downtown Los Angeles, where it shares a one-way couplet with 4th Street. East of Alameda it becomes 4th Street, where it heads to East Los Angeles, where it turns back into 3rd Street upon crossing Indiana Street. 3rd Street eventually becomes Pomona Boulevard in Monterey Park, where it then turns into Potrero Grande Drive and finally turns into Rush Street in Rosemead and ends in El Monte.\n3rd Street passes along the south side of The Grove and \"The Original\" Farmers Market at Fairfax Avenue, near the headquarters of The Writers Guild of America, West. There are also many other restaurants, boutiques, and antique stores on this specific strip of 3rd Street, which is less upscale and more relaxed than nearby Robertson Boulevard and Melrose Avenue.\n3rd Street is parallel to two other major thoroughfares, Wilshire Boulevard to the south and Beverly Boulevard to the north.

It serves as a postal divider between north and south and is one of a few streets to run across the Los Angeles River.

In the book Down by the Los Angeles River, written by Joe Linton, the author narrates a walking path starting from First Street Bridge.\nLA voters in 1924 passed the Viaduct Bond Act, which would allocate $2 million through a tax, and the funds allocated would go toward revitalizing the Downtown Los Angeles bridges. The friends of the Los Angeles River mobilized the La Gran Limpieza to clean up the Los Angeles River with an educational feature where they invited elementary, middle, and high school students. A collaboration the friends of the Los Angeles had was with the Los Angeles Conservation Corps\u2019 Clean & Green program that monitored the water quality at the rivers monthly. Under their collaborated event efforts, activities included cleaning up trash, science experiments, educational workshop, and familiarizing participants with the Los Angeles River bridges themselves since events would be facilitated there to create community identity.\n\nNotable landmarks\nMonterey Park Village (eastern terminus)\nBeverly Center (western terminus)\nCBS West Coast Headquarters\nDisney Concert Hall\nGrand Park\nLos Angeles City Hall\nCaltrans District 7 Headquarters\nLittle Tokyo\nMariachi Plaza\nThe intersection of East 1st and Chicago streets in Boyle Heights is named Dolores Huerta Square.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to 1st Street (Los Angeles) at Wikimedia Commons","3":"7th Street is a street in Los Angeles, California running from S. Norton Ave in Mid-Wilshire through Downtown Los Angeles. It goes all the way to the eastern city limits at Indiana Ave., and the border between Boyle Heights, Los Angeles and East Los Angeles.\nOriginally agricultural land, 7th Street between Broadway (on which corner stood Bullock's) and Figueroa Street, became downtown's upscale shopping district. This began with J. W. Robinson's deciding to build their flagship store in 1915 on Seventh far to the west of the existing Broadway shopping district, between Hope and Grand streets. The Ville de Paris and Coulter's as well as numerous specialty shops came and rounded out the district.\nThe area lost its exclusivity when the upscale downtown stores opened branches in Hollywood, Mid-Wilshire, Westwood and Pasadena in the late 1920s through the 1940s, notably the establishment of Bullock's upscale landmark branch Bullocks Wilshire in Mid-Wilshire in 1929.\nThirteen large office buildings opened between 1920 and 1928. By 1929, every plot on 7th between Figueroa and Los Angeles Streets had been developed.\nThe area remained an important, if not the most exclusive, center of retail and office space throughout the 1950s, but started a slow decline throughout the 1980s due to suburbanization. It was also the concentration of Downtown financial activity on Bunker Hill, a few blocks north. The flagship department stores like Bullock's (1983), Barker Brothers (1984) and Robinson's (1993) had closed and only the Broadway\/Macy's at The Bloc, previously named Broadway Plaza remained. However, in 1986, the Seventh Market Place mall, now FIGat7th, opened, bringing a smaller retail cluster back to Seventh such as the 7th Street\/Metro Center station opening in 1991.\nWith new, large skyscrapers such as the Wilshire Grand Center and the nearby U.S. Bank Tower bridging the gap with Bunker Hill, Seventh Street is now contiguous to the large financial district to the north and is once again a highly desired office district.\n\nLandmarks\nIn order west to east.

It began with the establishment of Chappell's at 645 S.

It was innovative in offering parking in the rear.\nBarker Brothers opened their huge furniture emporium at 7th and Flower in 1926, two blocks west of J. W. Robinson's, which was already considered far west of the main Broadway shopping district. Myer Siegel followed a half block south, on Flower, that same year, as did Parmelee-Dohrmann, a large purveyor of china, crystal and silver. Other stores were Ashley & Evers, Ranschoff's, and Wetherby-Kayser shoes.\nBy 1931 Flower's heyday had petered out due to the depression, the opening of Bullock's Wilshire (1929) and I. Magnin (1939) much further west on Wilshire Blvd., as Myer Siegel's 1934 move to 7th Street.\n\n\n== References ==","4":"77 Sunset Strip is an American television private detective drama series created by Roy Huggins and starring Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Roger Smith, Richard Long (from 1960 to 1961) and Edd Byrnes (billed as Edward Byrnes).

The show ran from 1958 to 1964.\nThe character of detective Stuart Bailey was first used by writer Huggins in his 1946 novel The Double Take, later adapted  into the 1948 film I Love Trouble.\n\nDescription\nInitial setup and characters\nPrivate detective and former World War II Office of Strategic Services secret agent and foreign languages professor Stuart (\"Stu\") Bailey (Zimbalist) and former government agent and nonpracticing attorney Jeff Spencer (Smith) form a duo who work from stylish offices at 77 Sunset Boulevard in Suites 101 and 102. Tab Hunter claimed he was the first choice for the lead of the series, but turned it down.\nThe street address was colloquially known as the Sunset Strip and was between La Cienega Boulevard and Alta Loma Road on the south side of the strip, next door to Dean Martin's real-life lounge, Dino's Lodge. Typically the two detectives would alternate as leads, with a Stuart Bailey case being featured one week and a Jeff Spencer case the next\u2014although depending on the nature of the case, sometimes the two would team up.\nSuzanne Fabry, the beautiful French switchboard operator played by Jacqueline Beer, handles the phones for Sunset Answering Service, in Suite 103. The firm of Bailey & Spencer employs her answering service, as do other clients. Although not technically an employee of the firm, Suzanne is involved in casework from time to time, especially in Season 2.\nComic relief is provided by Roscoe the racetrack tout (played by Louis Quinn), who frequently hangs around the offices giving horse-racing tips. However he is sometimes used as an operative and is an ever-informed source for the word on the street.\nThe firm's most frequently seen police contact is Lt. Roy Gilmore (Byron Keith), who is almost never called by his first name.\nThe show's breakout character, who had not been included in the pilot film, was Gerald Lloyd \"Kookie\" Kookson III (Edd Byrnes), the rock and roll-loving, wisecracking, hair-combing hipster and aspiring PI who initially works as the valet parking attendant at Dino's, the club next to the detectives' office. Kookie often becomes involved in the firm's cases and is eventually made a full partner in the firm, with his own office.\nAlso seen relatively frequently are the Frank Ortega Trio, playing themselves as the jazzy house band at Dino's Lodge.\n\nTone and cultural impact\nHuggins intended the show to be a hard-edged drama, but beginning with the 23rd episode, \"The Pasadena Caper\", the tone started to become much lighter, with a strong element of self-deprecating humor and the word \"caper\" frequently used in episode titles. The catchy theme song, written by Mack David and Jerry Livingston, typified the show's breezy, jazzed atmosphere. The song became the centerpiece of an album of the show's music in Warren Barker orchestrations, which was released in 1959, a top-10 hit in the Billboard LP charts.\nThe Kookie character became a cultural phenomenon, with his slang expressions such as \"ginchy\" (cool) and \"piling up Zs\" (sleeping). When Kookie helped the detectives on a case by singing a song, Edd Byrnes began a singing career with the novelty single \"Kookie, Kookie (Lend Me Your Comb)\", based on his frequent combing of his hair; this featured Connie Stevens on vocals in the chorus and the song, with words and music by Irving Taylor, became the first hit single for the recently established Warner Bros. Records. Kookie was also used to provide product placement for Harley-Davidson, appearing on their Topper motor scooter in the show and in Harley-Davidson advertisements.\nThe show became the first \"franchise\" in television, spawning no fewer than three spinoffs recreating the \"77\" format, a team of private detectives, their secretary and sidekick, solving cases, in picturesque cities.  Surfside Six was set in Miami Beach; Hawaiian Eye's home base was Honolulu. Bourbon Street Beat saw a similar detective agency located in New Orleans.  In some cases,77 scripts were recycled and rewritten to fit the characters of each series.  It was the genesis of the concept that drives contemporary shows such as Law & Order, NCIS, CSI and the Chicago P.D.\/Chicago Med\/Chicago Fire series, as well as 9-1-1.\n\nCast changes during Seasons 1\u20135\nWhen Byrnes' demands for more money and an expanded role were not met, he left the show for a period in Season 2. After an absence of 16 episodes beginning in January 1960, Byrnes and Warner Bros. settled their differences, and Kookie came back beginning in May. (During his absence, Roscoe's and Suzanne's roles were beefed up to handle the work normally assigned to Kookie.)\nFor the 1960\u201361 season, Richard Long (who appeared in different roles in two Season 1 episodes) moved over from the recently canceled detective series Bourbon Street Beat. His character of Rex Randolph from Bourbon Street Beat was said to have left New Orleans and relocated to North Hollywood, joining Bailey and Spencer's firm and taking Office 104. The character was dropped after one season, but Long (once again playing different one-shot guest characters) was seen again on 77 Sunset Strip in Seasons 5 and 6.\nKookie became a full-fledged detective and partner in the firm as of Season 4, taking over Rex Randolph's office in 104. At the same time, Robert Logan became the new parking-lot attendant, J.R. Hale, who usually speaks in abbreviations. Hale is seen throughout Seasons 4 and 5.\n\nEpisode and guest cast highlights\nOne of the series' more unusual episodes was 1960's \"The Silent Caper\", written by Smith. As the title suggests, the episode presented its story completely without dialogue. Another offbeat entry was 1961's \"Reserved for Mr. Bailey\", which finds Zimbalist alone in a ghost town. He is the only main actor on screen for the entire hour. (This episode was not included in the syndication package, and many fans had expressed their frustration at being unable to see it again. After 56 years out of circulation, it finally resurfaced on MeTV on June 17, 2017.)\nThe show was so popular that rising young actors clamored for guest spots. Up-and-comers who made guest appearances include: Ellen Burstyn, Roger Moore, DeForest Kelley, William Shatner, Mary Tyler Moore, Shirley MacLaine look-alike Gigi Verone, Robert Conrad, Dyan Cannon, Janet De Gore, Jay North, Connie Stevens, Irish McCalla, Adam West, Tuesday Weld, Sherry Jackson, Marlo Thomas, Max Baer Jr., Carole Mathews, Elizabeth Montgomery, Karen Steele, Randy Stuart, Susan Oliver, Robert Vaughn, Suzanne Storrs, Peter Breck, Donna Douglas, Troy Donahue, Chad Everett, Gena Rowlands, Cloris Leachman, Eve McVeagh, and Diane Ladd.\nEstablished film and TV actors and older stars who guest-starred include Fay Wray, Francis X. Bushman, Rodolfo Hoyos Jr., Ida Lupino, Liliane Montevecchi, Keenan Wynn, Rolfe Sedan, Jim Backus, Billie Burke, Buddy Ebsen, George Jessel, Peter Lorre, Boris Karloff, Burgess Meredith, Nick Adams, Gerald Mohr and Roy Roberts, among others. The show occasionally featured sports stars such as Sandy Koufax in guest roles.\n\nThe controversial sixth season, 1963\u20131964\nIn 1963, as the show's popularity waned, the entire cast was dismissed except for Zimbalist. Jack Webb was brought in as executive producer and William Conrad as a producer\/director. The character of Stuart Bailey was presented as a solo private investigator, with no continuity or reference to his past years with Jeff Spencer, Suzanne, Kookie and Roscoe or to his military OSS background. It was an abrupt, unexplained disconnect; the new 77 Sunset Strip was virtually an entirely different show that just happened to use the same title and lead character name, although the lead character was now very different. The series and Bailey's personality took on a darker tone, and the familiar office, parking lot and Dino's Lodge were gone. A new musical theme was written by Bob Thompson.\nThe Season 6 show title was not changed; it still was an address, but Bailey's new office is dramatically different from that which he shared with Spencer for the previous five years. The interior of Bailey's new office building is shown behind the show's opening and closing credits, forcing viewers to ponder how the same address could look so very different (it was actually the historic Bradbury Building in downtown Los Angeles). There seemed to be no spoken mention of his office address in the Season 6 shows, although in the episode \"Bonus Baby\" when a police officer inspects Bailey's private investigator license, a close-up shows the address \"77 Sunset Strip.\"\nAs the season progressed, there were some shifts in tone. Several episodes into the season, Bailey's stern personality became lighter, though still different from that of prior seasons. His secretary Hannah, previously known to Season 6 viewers only because Bailey addressed her in his recorded dictations, was seen on screen beginning with the season's 11th episode. Played by Joan Staley, Hannah worked in Bailey's office, where he developed a romantic interest in her\u2014but she continually stymied and frustrated him by playing hard-to-get.\nAs of episode \"Alimony League\" (the 16th of the season's 20 episodes), the opening and closing background of Bradbury building was gone, replaced by Bailey in silhouette walking past lighted store windows. This was actually a scene from \"5\" (the sixth-season opener) and it was supposedly located in New York City where Bailey arrived to work for a client to \"pay his dead brother's way into heaven.\"\nThe episode \"The Target\" was unusual because key roles were played by the show's primary behind-the-scenes crew, who happened to also be experienced actors. Show producer William Conrad played Maestrian, associate producer James Lydon played Charlie, writer Tony Barrett played Carnovan and director Lawrence Dobkin played Landers.\nViewers did not appreciate the numerous changes to the show, and it was canceled halfway through its sixth season in February 1964. In the 1964 summer reruns period, shows from the Bailey and Spencer years were shown, and the Season 6 episodes were abandoned, rarely seen until September 2017 on MeTV.\n\nBroadcast history\nNOTE: The most frequent time slot for the series is in bold text.\n\nFriday at 9:30\u201310:30 pm on ABC: October 10, 1958 \u2013 May 29, 1959; October 12, 1962 \u2013 June 14, 1963\nFriday at 9:00\u201310:00  pm on ABC: October 2, 1959 \u2013 June 29, 1962\nFriday at 7:30\u20138:30  pm on ABC: September 20, 1963 \u2013 February 7, 1964\n\nRelated shows\nThe success of 77 Sunset Strip led to the creation of several other detective shows in exotic locales, all produced by the Warner Bros. studio, which created Strip \u2014 Bourbon Street Beat in New Orleans with Richard Long and Andrew Duggan, Hawaiian Eye in Honolulu with Robert Conrad and Connie Stevens, and Surfside 6 in Miami Beach with Troy Donahue and Van Williams. The casts and scripts of these various shows sometimes crossed over, which was logistically easy, since they were all shot in Burbank on the Warner Bros. lot. Some of the detectives, played by the same actors, became regulars in other series after their original series had been cancelled.\nThe office and bar\/nightclub sets of  77 Sunset Strip and Hawaiian Eye were on the same WB soundstage, intertwined to save space, with shared room walls and some doors actually going between the sets (not obvious to viewers).\n\nLegacy\nAn engraving in the Sunset Boulevard sidewalk (address number 8524) between La Cienega Boulevard and Alta Loma Road commemorated 77 Sunset Strip, but the area was slated for redevelopment as part of the Sunset Millennium project. In a twist of fate, the opposition to the redevelopment of the area was known as \"Save Our Strip\" or \"SOS\" and was spearheaded by former 77 Sunset Strip semiregular Gigi Verone. No number 77 exists on the Strip, as all Sunset Boulevard addresses in the area have four digits. When looked for in January 2023, no trace of the sidewalk engraving remained.\nThe show was referenced in an episode of Jay Ward's Fractured Flickers, showing a satirical depiction of Ward looking at a lineup of fictional shows, one of them being \"77 Gaza Strip.\"\nEpisodes of the television series can be seen in reruns through syndication packages offered by Warner Bros. Studios. At one time, 43 episodes had been removed from syndication for various legal reasons, but 13 of these can now be seen as reruns. As of 2017, the syndication package aired on Me-TV contained every original episode.\nThirty-one years after the series left the air, Warner Bros. proposed a modern revival of 77 Sunset Strip, which was to be the first hour-long drama series to air on the new WB Television Network. It was to be produced by Clint Eastwood and starred Jim Caviezel, Timothy Olyphant and Maria Bello. A 25-minute pilot presentation was shot for upfronts in the spring of 1997, but despite a few attempts to modify and finalize it for broadcast in 1997\u20131998, the project never made it past the testing stage. Early mentions of the show were made in the network's fall affiliate presentation promotion, with the 77 Sunset Strip logo visible in the movie backlot motif.\n\nEpisode list\nReferences\nExternal links\n\n77 Sunset Strip at IMDb\n77 Sunset Strip at Thrilling Detective\n77 Sunset Strip at TVparty.com\nEfrem Zimbalist, Jr. interview in 1997 by Sylvia Stoddard","5":"Abbot Kinney Boulevard is a mile-long road lined with shops, restaurants, and galleries located in the southern part of Venice, Los Angeles, California.

It is approximately 21 miles in length, running from Harry Bridges Boulevard in Wilmington; and through Carson, Compton, Lynwood, Watts, Florence-Graham, Huntington Park, Vernon and Arts District to Spring and College in Chinatown. For much of its length, Alameda runs through present and former industrial corridors, and is paralleled by Union Pacific Railroad (formerly Southern Pacific Railroad) tracks.\n\nRoute description\nDowntown and Chinatown\nAlameda Street runs on the east side of the Old Plaza, Los Angeles, and once also ran along the westside of Old Chinatown. In the late 19th century, Alameda Street and Commercial Street were Los Angeles' original red-light district.  South of Union Station, Alameda Street enters Little Tokyo and the former Warehouse District, now the Arts District. At one time, a lot on Alameda and 8th was a haven for free-speech demonstrations.\n\nSouth of Downtown\nAt 27th Street, Alameda Street splits into two roadways divided by the 10-mile (16 km) Mid-Corridor Trench: a local roadway on the east and the main Alameda Street to the west. Here, Alameda Street intersects with Slauson Avenue, Florence Avenue, Firestone Boulevard (former SR 42) and Imperial Highway.  Each of these streets is grade-separated from the rail line.  Though Alameda Street has interchanges with I-10, SR 91 and I-405, it does not have an interchange with I-105 near Watts.\n\nCalifornia State Route 47\nAlameda Street is designated California State Route 47 between the California State Route 91 and Henry Ford Avenue. There are few at-grade crossings with other streets in this portion of Alameda, with Artesia Boulevard, Del Amo Boulevard, Carson Street, 223rd Street (at the San Diego Freeway\/I-405 interchange) Sepulveda Boulevard, and Pacific Coast Highway (SR 1), all flying over Alameda while being connected to it with connector ramps. Alameda Street descends into a tunnel between California State 91 and Del Amo Boulevard, at which point the Alameda Corridor crosses from the east to the west of Alameda.\nSouth of Henry Ford Avenue, Alameda Street continues for another 1.4 miles (2.3 km) in Wilmington before ending at Harry Bridges Boulevard (formerly B Street).\n\nSouthern Pacific Railroad\nAlameda Street has a long history of Southern Pacific Railroad tracks running on or parallel to it. Before the building of Union Station, Southern Pacific trains would travel along Alameda between Naud Junction and the Southern Pacific Arcade Station on 5th Street.  Though Southern Pacific eventually rerouted its downtown tracks to the LA River, Alameda still carries SP tracks between 27th Street and the Port of Los Angeles. This area is known as the Alameda Corridor. With the 2002 completion of the Alameda Corridor in a trench adjacent to Alameda, the trackage is now shared by the BNSF Railway and Union Pacific Railroad (Southern Pacific's company). Los Angeles Union Station fronts onto Alameda Street.\n\nHistory\nThe street is located on Tongva land. In the 1820s, historian William David Estrada records that immigrants from France came to Los Angeles in small numbers and settled around the Commercial and Alameda streets, close to the original village site of Yaanga.\nThe street became a center of prostitution activity in Los Angeles by the late 19th century, after the city council passed an ordinance prohibiting prostitution from the new central business district. Prostitution reportedly peaked in the 1890s, \"with the support of local police and elected officials, many of whom were regular visitors\" to the brothels. Those on North Alameda Street, adjacent to the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks, were the most active and became \"the first view of Los Angeles for arriving train passengers.\" \nIn the late 19th century, the corner of Alameda Street and Macy Street (now Cesar Chavez Avenue) was home to residences shared by Mexican and Chinese families. Along Alameda and Los Angeles Streets to Second Street was primarily a Japanese community, shared with Mexicans, and the last remnants of the French community.\n\nTransit\nMetro Local Line 202 runs along Alameda Street between Del Amo Boulevard and Pacific Coast Highway.  Metro Local Line 58 formerly served Alameda Street between Union Station and Washington, but was discontinued in 2005.\nThree Metro A Line Stations are located on Alameda Street: Little Tokyo\/Arts District, Union Station, and Chinatown, with the former-most also served by the Metro E Line. Union Station is also served by the B and D lines, as well as Metrolink and Amtrak.\n\n\n== References ==","7":"\"All I Wanna Do\" is a song performed by American singer and songwriter Sheryl Crow. It was written by Crow, David Baerwald, Bill Bottrell, and Kevin Gilbert, with lyrics adapted from Wyn Cooper's 1987 poem \"Fun\". Released in July 1994 by A&M, it was Crow's breakthrough hit from her 1993 debut album, Tuesday Night Music Club. The song is Crow's biggest US hit, peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 for six consecutive weeks from October 8 to November 12, 1994, and it also topped the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart. It was the winner of the 1995 Grammy for Record of the Year and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and was nominated for Song of the Year.\nIn addition to its US success, \"All I Wanna Do\" peaked at number one in Australia for one week and in Canada for four weeks, also topping the RPM Adult Contemporary Tracks chart in the latter country. In New Zealand and the United Kingdom, it peaked at number four, and in Europe, it reached the top 10 in Austria, Flanders, France, Germany, Ireland, and the Netherlands. The accompanying music video was directed by David Hogan and Roman Coppola. Crow performed the song on her live album Sheryl Crow and Friends: Live from Central Park.\n\nBackground and structure\nThe lyrics of the song are based on the poem \"Fun\" by Wyn Cooper. Cooper was inspired to write the poem by a conversation at a bar with a friend and occasional writer, Bill Ripley, in which he said \"All I want is to have a little fun before I die\", which became the first line of the poem. In a 1994 interview, Cooper said: \"The poem isn't really about him. Or me. They're different people. They're people you can sort of see as ... well ... objective correlatives. Symbols of people like us, or what we could have been, or what we would have become if we continued to drink and do nothing with our lives.\" \nToad Hall Studio, where the song was recorded, was next door to the Pasadena Playhouse. Crow's producer (Bottrell) discovered Cooper's poetry book The Country of Here Below in a  nearby used bookstore in Pasadena, California. Crow had written a song called \"I Still Love You\" but was unhappy with its lyrics; she used its melody and adapted the poem for her lyrics to \"All I Wanna Do\". \nThe song earned Cooper considerable royalties and helped to promote his book, originally published in a run of only 500 copies in 1987, into multiple reprints. After the song became popular, Ripley brought an unsuccessful lawsuit against Cooper for some of the song's royalties, which ended their friendship.\nThe opening spoken line, \"This ain't no disco\", is a reference to the song \"Life During Wartime\" by Talking Heads.\nIn 1997, after attending a performance by Crow at the Rosemont Theatre in Illinois, veteran Chicago Tribune music critic Greg Kot called the song \"a rewrite of Stealers Wheel's 'Stuck in the Middle with You'\".\n\nCritical reception\nLarry Flick from Billboard wrote, \"Critical darling is poised for a long-deserved top 40 breakthrough with this breezy hand-clapper. Crow has a friendly demeanor that adds extra bounce to a sweet instrumental setting of jangly guitars and toe-tapping beats. Live-sounding jam is a fitting soundtrack to a day at the beach or speeding down the highway with the top down.\" Troy J. Augusto from Cash Box felt it should have been the first single from Tuesday Night Music Club. \"Devil-may-care lyrics (\"I like a good beer-buzz, early in the morning\"), a cool country twang and Sheryl's friendly vocal style should all spell hit for this feelin'-good number. Rock, country, adult and, particularly, hits radio should all find lots to love about this low-key frolic. Don't miss the live show.\" In a second single review, he noted, \"Seriously infectious hook, simple yet clever instrumentation and Crow's likable personality all spell a winner here. A perfect summertime track, \"All I Wanna Do\" could well be the song that kicks off Sheryl's run at the big leagues.\" In his weekly UK chart commentary, James Masterton commented, that \"All I Wanna Do\" \"certainly has potential to go further, not least with Lisa Loeb as a role model but my one overwhelming confession is that I honestly cannot see what all the fuss is about. It's a good record, but no more.\" Alan Jones from Music Week said \"this cheery pop\/rock smash is a wordy, but expertly delivered and invigorating confection with a catchy chorus.\" He added, \"Brits may not smile as much as US rock buyers, but they'll grin enough to get this into the chart.\"\n\nMusic video\nThe accompanying music video for \"All I Wanna Do\" was directed by David Hogan and Roman Coppola, with Martin Coppen directing photography. It features Crow and her band performing the song on the street, with notable characters flying through the air. The video was filmed in front of the Roxy Theatre at the corner of Franklin Street and North 1st Street in Clarksville, Tennessee.\nTwo versions of the music video exist. The original video featured the character \"Billy\", mentioned in the song, played by actor Gregory Sporleder. A second version of the video was released with the character's appearances edited out. The edited version appears on Crow's \"Greatest Hits\" music video DVD. In 2009, an additional music video was released, featured on the 2009 re-release of Tuesday Night Music Club.\n\nImpact and legacy\nIn 2017, Billboard ranked \"All I Wanna Do\" number three on their list of the \"10 Greatest Sheryl Crow Songs\". In 2023, The Guardian ranked the song number five on their list of the \"20 Greatest Sheryl Crow Songs\", while Billboard ranked it number 405 in their \"500 Best Pop Songs of All Time\". The latter added, \"Well, it ain't no disco and it ain't no country club neither \u2014 it's the L.A.-set slice-of-life breakout hit for singer-songwriter Sheryl Crow, a \"Piano Man\" for the alt-rock '90s.\"\n\nTrack listings\nCharts\nCertifications\nRelease history\nCover versions\nAmy Studt version\nEnglish singer-songwriter Amy Studt released a cover version of \"All I Wanna Do\" as her fourth single.

It stocks media, primarily music, but also films and television programs via DVD and VHS. Its music selection includes rock, pop, blues, soul, funk, rap, and jazz. It is popular as a tourist destination for fans of physical media or music in general. It was founded in 1990 in Berkeley, California, and remains in operation, having survived the decline of CD sales in the 2000s. Amoeba stores generally focus on vinyl and compact discs.\n\nHistory\nOriginal Berkeley store (1990)\nAmoeba Music was founded by former employees of nearby Rasputin Records and opened on Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley in 1990. The original founding members were Marc Weinstein, Dave Prinz, and Mike Boyder. The iconic Amoeba logo was designed by comic book artist Shepherd Hendrix. Primarily operating on reselling used goods, Amoeba has survived the decline of CD sales since the early 2000s with its trade-in program and the advent of the vinyl revival.\n\nSecond store (San Francisco, 1997)\nA second location, in San Francisco, opened on November 15, 1997, in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood near Golden Gate Park. It is located in the former 24,000-square-foot (2,200 m2) Park Bowl bowling alley. It regularly stocks upwards of 100,000 CDs, vinyl records, and audio cassettes, both new and used.\n\nThird store (Los Angeles, 2001)\nA third location, in Los Angeles, opened on November 17, 2001, on Sunset Boulevard at Cahuenga Boulevard in Hollywood. At the time of its opening, the store planned to stock as many as 250,000 titles, which would have placed it among the largest independent music stores in the world. According to Los Angeles Times writer Michael Hiltzik, the location \"instantly became a Hollywood landmark.\"\nAmoeba's world music department was headed by Robert Leaver, co-founder of the Round World Music record shop and label in San Francisco. He also worked as a buyer of international records for Amoeba's Berkeley location.\nThe stores also trade-in movies, though secondarily to their music business. Each location has a smaller collection of movies on DVD, VHS, Laserdisc, and Blu-ray. In addition, each store maintains a selection of music-related posters and artwork for purchase, as well as Amoeba-branded merchandise. The Sunset Boulevard store had an entire second floor dedicated to DVD and Blu-ray at its original location. In addition, Amoeba Music frequently held free shows during store hours with locally- and nationally-known artists from a wide variety of genres.\nIn 2015, Amoeba sold the Sunset Boulevard property to a holding company but continued to lease the space. In 2018, it was announced that the owners would demolish the site and replace it with a contemporary glass-and-steel tower with residential units and commercial space, and Amoeba would be moving. On April 27, 2020, Amoeba announced that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Sunset Boulevard location was closed permanently ahead of schedule. Along with the statewide stay-at-home order issued by California governor Gavin Newsom in the COVID-19 pandemic, many non-essential stores were told to close to prevent spread of COVID-19. Amoeba subsequently started a fundraising campaign on GoFundMe to pay the bills, as most of their income is derived from in-store purchases.\n\nRelocated Los Angeles store (2021)\nAmoeba found a new location for its Los Angeles store on Hollywood Boulevard at Argyle Avenue. It is located inside of a newly constructed apartment complex, the El Centro. The store's vast collections of music CDs, LPs, DVDs, and books were temporarily in storage during construction at the new site during 2020 and 2021. The new location opened on April 1, 2021.\nThe new Amoeba Music store is located near the popular Pantages Theatre in the Hollywood and Vine area. Continuing the tradition of free live shows for customers at the store, the new Amoeba Music frequently holds free shows during store hours with locally- and nationally-known artists from a wide variety of genres. The band Red Hot Chili Peppers gave a free live performance at the store for Amoeba Music customers after receiving a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame near the entrance to Amoeba Music store on March 31, 2022. George Clinton, Woody Harrelson, and Bob Forrest unveiled the star at the ceremony.\n\nYouTube channel\nAmoeba's YouTube channel was created on January 27, 2006, and is home to interviews, recordings of live performances at Amoeba locations, and the Webby Award \u2014 winning series What\u2019s In My Bag? with various \"featuring artists and tastemakers sharing what they found shopping at Amoeba.\"\n\nPopular culture\nThe Hollywood store was included as a playable venue in the 2008 music game Guitar Hero World Tour. Paul McCartney recorded his EP Amoeba's Secret (which was also released as Amoeba Gig in its entirety in 2019) at an unannounced live performance at the Hollywood location on June 27, 2007.\n\nGallery\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial homepage of Amoeba Music\nHermes, Will (February 19, 1998). \"The World's Greatest Record Store?\".

Its route is to\/through the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument and the Angeles National Forest. With the exception of a 1,000 feet (300 m)-long section in La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge, the entire route is part of California State Route 2.\nThe road is 66 miles (106 km) in length, with its western terminus at the intersection at Foothill Boulevard in La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge and its eastern terminus at the Pearblossom Highway (State Route 138) northeast of Wrightwood.  The majority of the route passes through the San Gabriel Mountains located north of the Greater Los Angeles Area.  Segments of the road reach elevations above 7,000 feet (2,100 m), with a summit of 7,903 feet (2,409 m) at the Dawson Saddle, which makes this road one of the highest in Southern California.\nThe segment from La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge to the Los Angeles\u2013San Bernardino county line is known as the Angeles Crest Scenic Byway, which is both a National Forest Scenic Byway and an officially designated California Scenic Highway.\n\nRoute description\nThe route is best described as mountain-rural.  Because the route passes through the protected San Gabriel Mountains National Monument and Angeles National Forest, development is very limited.  There are not many buildings between La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge and Wrightwood save for Newcomb's Ranch, and forest service campgrounds and visitor centers.  Other points of interest along the route include the Mountain High and Mt. Waterman ski areas.\nMount Wilson and its Mount Wilson Observatory and various radio\/television transmitters are about 4.5 miles from the junction of Mount Wilson Road and Angeles Crest Highway.  Depending on visibility conditions, impressive views of the Los Angeles Basin are possible from the vicinity of Mount Wilson. The most frequent hindrances of what can be seen are the smog and\/or a marine layer covering the basin below.\nThe westernmost segment of the highway, combined with Angeles Forest Highway to\/from State Route 14, is heavily travelled by southbound traffic in the morning (and corresponding northbound traffic in the afternoon) that comprises commuters who live in the Antelope Valley and work in the Greater Los Angeles Area.  The route is a convenient alternative to the Antelope Valley Freeway (State Route 14) and the Golden State Freeway (Interstate 5), both located to the west, for reaching the Foothill Freeway (Interstate 210) and San Gabriel Valley.  Because the road is a two-lane highway, its vehicle capacity is significantly lower than either of the two freeways.\nIn contrast, the remainder of the Angeles Crest Highway is lightly traveled. Typically, this traffic is composed of vacationers, sightseers, and locals. The three areas comprising Mountain High ski resort are just west of Wrightwood.\n\nHistory\nConstruction of Angeles Crest Highway began in 1929. It was originally intended to be a fire access road. In 1941 construction stopped because of World War II. In 1946, after the war, construction resumed; the completed highway eventually opened in 1956. The road was constructed by prison labor from Camp 37, which has since been razed.  Division of Highways (now known as CalTrans) staff lived at a site called Cedar Springs. The staff is now located at Chilao Flats. Children of the staff attended Chilao Mountain School, a one-room school; the school has been closed for several years.\nAngeles Crest Highway was originally planned to be upgraded to a freeway in the 1950s, but was later considered geographically improbable and the plans were abandoned.\nRoads in the San Gabriel Mountains have a high number of single-vehicle auto and motorcycle accidents.  As an example, in the predawn hours of December 8, 2004, a van plunged off the side of Angeles Forest Highway at about 1-mile (1.6 km) north of its junction with the Angeles Crest Highway, killing 3 of the 10 people in the van. The van was a carpool carrying workers of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory from the Antelope Valley to work in Pasadena. It was determined upon investigation by the CHP that the driver fell asleep at the wheel of the van.  The Angeles Crest Highway and Angeles Forest Highway have figured in various murders, not as scenes of the murders but as drop-off points for the bodies of the victims, including that of Linda Sobek, a model kidnapped and found dead in the area in 1995.\nThe motion picture Donnie Darko, released in 2001, was partially filmed on Angeles Crest Highway.  In the opening scene with Donnie waking up in the middle of the road, next to his bike, the camera zooms in on Donnie, then loops around and shows a view of the valley seen from Angeles Crest Highway. The highway is also used later in the movie for other scenes.  The Angeles Crest Highway is also used extensively in the motion picture The Love Bug for racing scenes, as well as in the sequel film Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo, where the highway doubles for \"The French Alps\".\n\nAccess and closures\nIntersections with other roads are few, which can be problematic in the event of road closures due to acts of nature such as landslides and fires.  At about the midpoint of the highway is the junction with the north terminus of State Route 39.  However, access to State Route 39 is not possible as it is closed indefinitely to automobile traffic because of persistent landslides along its route. Therefore, travelers to the Angeles National Forest preferring the Angeles Crest Highway corridor should expect to be on the Angeles Crest Highway throughout much of its length, use available alternate routing where possible, or be willing to turn around and retrace their trip at any point along its route if necessary.\nThe Angeles Crest Highway is normally closed in the winter from Islip Saddle to Vincent Gap due to rockfall and avalanche hazards.\nThe winter storms of 2004\/05 caused several landslides and significant damage to the highway. Thus, the highway never reopened in the summer of 2005. Damage to the highway was estimated to be over $4 million as of November 2005. Terri Kasinga, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Transportation, stated in November 2005 \"It is definitely not going to open until next spring (of 2006)\". However, a March 2006 storm caused even more extensive damage to the highway, including a complete washout of a large section of roadway, further delaying the reopening of the highway. The long closure caused concern for the United States Forest Service and other emergency services agencies because it hindered access, particularly with firefighting efforts, and it hurt business in Wrightwood. After a four-and-a-half year closure, the highway reopened on May 20, 2009. Repairs included the construction of a new bridge intended to allow landslides to pass underneath without damaging the road. The work cost $10.5 million.\nA moratorium on three-axles trucks was imposed in 2009 following the deaths of two people when a tractor trailer lost control and crashed into a La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge business (other California highways have similar truck bans such as I-580 and SR 85 but have been implemented for different reasons).\nCell phone reception is sporadic and signal strength and clarity are poor, due to the terrain and distance from cellular communication antennas.\nThe Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act passed in December 2004, protects the Angeles National Forest. Although anyone can park at the side of the road and access the wilderness along the side of the road, doing so for extended periods of time, such as camping or hiking, requires a National Forest Adventure Pass available for a $5.00 fee.\n\n2009 Station Fire closure\nDuring the 2009 wildfire season the large fire known as the \"Station Fire\" burned the mountains through which Route 2 travels.  The fire damaged the signs, guardrails, and lane striping, as well as leaving large boulders and other debris all over the road.  As a result, the highway was closed by Caltrans until November 30, 2009.  It was briefly re-opened until mud and rock slides in early 2010 forced a portion of the highway to be closed again from 2 miles east of the I-210 junction to 14 miles east of La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge. It reopened on June 3, 2011.\n\nSee also\nCalifornia Roads portal\nAngeles National Forest\u2212related topics\nSan Gabriel Mountains National Monument\u2212related topics\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nCaltrans: Angeles Crest Highway highway conditions\nCaltrans Traffic Conditions Map\nCalifornia Highway Patrol Traffic Incidents\nOfficial Angeles National Forest website\nTchester.org: Angeles Crest Highway\nTchester.org: Angeles Crest Highway (SR\u20142) Road Guide\nCycling on Angeles Crest Highway\nGeocities page on Angeles Crest Highway (Archived) 2009-10-25).\nAngeles Crest Highway news:\nLos Angeles Times\u2014\"Man About Town\" column: \"Rough and humble on the Angeles Crest Highway\"\nMarch 2006 Storm Damage Photos\nWikinews: Story on JPL van accident\nPasadenastarnews.com: Charges dismissed in JPL van accident\nMotorcycle Classics article on riding the Angeles Crest Highway to Newcomb's Ranch","12":"Andrew Lloyd Webber, Baron Lloyd-Webber,  (born 22 March 1948) is an English composer and impresario of musical theatre. Several of his musicals have run for more than a decade both in the West End and on Broadway. He has composed 21 musicals, a song cycle, a set of variations, two film scores, and a Latin Requiem Mass.\nSeveral of Lloyd Webber's songs have been widely recorded and widely successful outside their parent musicals, such as \"Memory\" from Cats, \"The Music of the Night\" and \"All I Ask of You\" from The Phantom of the Opera, \"I Don't Know How to Love Him\" from Jesus Christ Superstar, \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\" from Evita, and \"Any Dream Will Do\" from Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. In 2001, The New York Times referred to him as \"the most commercially successful composer in history\". The Daily Telegraph named him in 2008 the fifth-most powerful person in British culture, on which occasion lyricist Don Black said that \"Andrew more or less single-handedly reinvented the musical.\"\nLloyd Webber has received numerous awards, including a knighthood in 1992, followed by a peerage for services to the arts, six Tonys, seven Olivier Awards, three Grammys (as well as the Grammy Legend Award), an Academy Award, 14 Ivor Novello Awards, a Golden Globe, a Brit Award, the 2006 Kennedy Center Honors, and two Classic Brit Awards (for Outstanding Contribution to Music in 2008, and for Musical Theatre and Education in 2018). In 2018, after Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Special (Live), he became the thirteenth person to win an Oscar, an Emmy, a Grammy, and a Tony. He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, is an inductee into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and is a fellow of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors.\nThe Really Useful Group, Lloyd Webber's company, is one of the largest theatre operators in London. Producers in several parts of the UK have staged productions, including national tours, of Lloyd Webber musicals under licence from the Really Useful Group. He is also the president of the Arts Educational Schools, London, a performing arts school located in Chiswick, West London. Lloyd Webber is involved in a number of charitable activities, including the Elton John AIDS Foundation, Nordoff Robbins, Prostate Cancer UK and War Child. In 1992, he started the Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation which supports the arts, culture, and heritage of the UK.\n\nEarly life\nLloyd Webber was born on 22 March 1948 in Kensington, London, the elder son of William Lloyd Webber (1914\u20131982), a composer and organist, and Jean Hermione Johnstone (1921\u20131993), a violinist and pianist. His younger brother, Julian Lloyd Webber, is a world-renowned solo cellist. On the BBC's genealogy series Who Do You Think You Are?, he learned that his mother's great-great-uncle was the soldier Sir Peregrine Maitland who in 1815 served as a major general at the Battle of Waterloo.\n\nLloyd Webber started writing his own music at a young age: a suite of six pieces at the age of nine. He also put on \"productions\" with Julian and his aunt Viola in his toy theatre (which he built at Viola's suggestion). In his memoir, he writes: \"mum was determined that I should be a prodigy in something or other.\" His aunt Viola, an actress, took him to see many of her shows and through the stage door into the world of the theatre. His father enrolled him as a part-time student at the Eric Gilder School of Music in 1963. At this time he was working on a Genghis Khan musical called Westonia!.\nFrom 1960 to 1965, Lloyd Webber was a Queen's Scholar at Westminster School. An avid listener of 1960s rock and pop music, he called The Rolling Stones song \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\" the \"best record of the Sixties\", and Dusty Springfield's rendition of \"Son of a Preacher Man\" the song that taught him \"the power of a perfect pop song\". He studied history for a term at Magdalen College, Oxford, although he abandoned the course in the winter of 1965 to study at the Royal College of Music in London and pursue his interest in musical theatre.\n\nCareer\nEarly years\nIn 1965, when Lloyd Webber was a 17-year-old budding musical-theatre composer, he was introduced to the 20-year-old aspiring pop-song writer Tim Rice. Their first collaboration was The Likes of Us, an Oliver!-inspired musical based on the true story of Thomas John Barnardo. They produced a demo tape of that work in 1966, but the project failed to gain a backer.\nAlthough composed in 1965, The Likes of Us was not publicly performed until 2005, when a production was staged at Lloyd Webber's Sydmonton Festival. In 2008, amateur rights were released by the National Operatic and Dramatic Association (NODA) in association with the Really Useful Group. The first amateur performance was by a children's theatre group in Cornwall called \"Kidz R Us\". Stylistically, The Likes of Us is fashioned after the Broadway musical of the 1940s and 1950s; it opens with a traditional overture comprising a medley of tunes from the show, and the score reflects some of Lloyd Webber's early influences, particularly Richard Rodgers, Frederick Loewe, and Lionel Bart. In this respect, it is markedly different from the composer's later work, which tends to be either predominantly or wholly through-composed, and closer in form to opera.\n\nIn the summer of 1967, Alan Doggett, a family friend of the Lloyd Webbers who had assisted on The Likes of Us and who was the music teacher at the Colet Court school in London, commissioned Lloyd Webber and Rice to write a piece for the school's choir. Doggett requested a \"pop cantata\" along the lines of Herbert Chappell's The Daniel Jazz (1963) and Michael Hurd's Jonah-Man Jazz (1966), both of which had been published by Novello and were based on the Old Testament. The request for the new piece came with a 100-guinea advance from Novello. This resulted in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, a retelling of the biblical story of Joseph, in which Lloyd Webber and Rice humorously pastiched a number of pop-music styles such as Elvis-style rock'n'roll, Calypso and country music. Joseph began life as a short cantata that gained some recognition on its second staging with a favourable review in The Times. For its subsequent performances, Rice and Lloyd Webber revised the show and added new songs to expand it to a more substantial length. Continued expansion eventually culminated in a 1972 stage musical and then a two-hour-long production being staged in the West End in 1973 on the back of the success of Jesus Christ Superstar.\nIn 1969, Rice and Lloyd Webber wrote a song for the Eurovision Song Contest called \"Try It and See\", which was not selected. With rewritten lyrics, it became \"King Herod's Song\" in their third musical, Jesus Christ Superstar (1970). Debuting on Broadway in 1971, by 1980 the musical had grossed more than $237 million worldwide. Running for over eight years in London between 1972 and 1980, it held the record for longest-running West End musical before it was overtaken by Cats in 1989. The planned follow-up to Jesus Christ Superstar was a musical comedy based on the Jeeves and Wooster novels by P. G. Wodehouse. Tim Rice was uncertain about this venture, partly because of his concern that he might not be able to do justice to the novels that he and Lloyd Webber so admired. Rice backed out of the project and Lloyd Webber subsequently wrote the musical Jeeves with Alan Ayckbourn, who provided the book and lyrics. Jeeves failed to make any impact at the box office and closed after a run of only 38 performances in the West End in 1975. Many years later, Lloyd Webber and Ayckbourn revisited this project, producing a thoroughly reworked and more successful version entitled By Jeeves (1996).\n\nMid-1970s\nLloyd Webber collaborated with Rice once again to write Evita (1978), a musical based on the life of Eva Per\u00f3n. As with Jesus Christ Superstar, Evita was released first as a concept album (1976) featuring Julie Covington singing the part of Eva Per\u00f3n. The song \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\" became a hit single and the musical was staged at the West End's Prince Edward Theatre in a production directed by Harold Prince and starring Elaine Paige in the title role. This original production was enormously successful, eventually running for nearly eight years in the West End.\nEvita transferred to Broadway in 1979, in a production starring Patti LuPone as Eva and Mandy Patinkin as Che; it won seven Tony Awards, including Best Musical, helped launch the careers of both LuPone and Patinkin, and ran for almost four years. Rice and Lloyd Webber parted ways soon after Evita, although they have sporadically worked together since then.\nIn 1978, Lloyd Webber embarked on a project with his cellist brother Julian, the Variations, based on the 24th Caprice by Paganini; this reached number two in the pop album chart in the United Kingdom. The main theme was used as the theme tune for ITV's long-running South Bank Show throughout its 32-year run. The same year, Lloyd Webber also composed a new theme tune for the long-running documentary series Whicker's World, which was used from 1978 to 1980. He also composed the instrumental \"Argentine Melody\" as the theme music for the BBC's coverage of the 1978 FIFA World Cup held in Argentina.\n\n1980s\nLloyd Webber was the subject of This Is Your Life in November 1980 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews in the foyer of Thames Television's Euston Road Studios in London. He would be honoured a second time by the television programme in November 1994 when Michael Aspel surprised him at the West End's Adelphi Theatre.\n\nLloyd Webber embarked on his next project without a lyricist, turning instead to the poetry of T. S. Eliot. Cats (1981) was to become the longest-running musical in London, where it ran for 21 years and 8,949 performances before closing. On Broadway, Cats ran for 18 years, a record which would ultimately be broken by another Lloyd Webber musical, The Phantom of the Opera. Elaine Paige collaborated again with Lloyd Webber, originating the role of Grizabella in Cats, and had a Top 10 UK hit with \"Memory\".\n\nStarlight Express (1984) was a commercial hit, but received negative reviews from the critics. It ran for 7,409 performances in London, making it the ninth longest-running West End show. It ran for less than two years on Broadway. The show has also seen two tours of the US, as well as an Australian\/Japanese production, a three-year UK touring production, which transferred to New Zealand later in 2009. Starlight Express runs full-time in a custom-built theatre in Bochum, Germany, where it has been running since 1988. The German production holds the Guinness World Record for most visitors to a musical in a single theatre.\nLloyd Webber wrote a Requiem Mass dedicated to his father, William, who had died in 1982. It premiered at St. Thomas Church in New York on 24 February 1985. Church music had been a part of the composer's upbringing and the composition was inspired by an article he had read about the plight of Cambodian orphans. Lloyd Webber had on a number of occasions written sacred music for the annual Sydmonton Festival. Lloyd Webber received a Grammy Award in 1986 for Requiem in the category of best classical composition. Pie Jesu from Requiem achieved a high placing on the UK Singles Chart and was certified silver. Perhaps because of its large orchestration, live performances of the Requiem are rare.\nIn 1986, Prince Edward, the youngest son of Queen Elizabeth II, commissioned a short musical from Lloyd Webber and Rice for his mother's 60th birthday celebration. Cricket (1986), also called Cricket (Hearts and Wickets), reunited Lloyd Webber with Rice to create this short musical for the Queen's birthday, first performed at Windsor Castle. Several of the tunes were later used for Aspects of Love and Sunset Boulevard.\n\nLloyd Webber premiered The Phantom of the Opera at Her Majesty's Theatre in the West End in 1986, inspired by the 1911 Gaston Leroux novel. He wrote the part of Christine for his then wife, Sarah Brightman, who played the role in the original London and Broadway productions alongside Michael Crawford as the Phantom. The production was directed by Harold Prince, who had also earlier directed Evita. Charles Hart wrote the lyrics for Phantom with some additional material provided by Richard Stilgoe, with whom Lloyd Webber co-wrote the book of the musical. It became a hit and is still running in the West End; in January 2006 it overtook Lloyd Webber's Cats as the longest-running show on Broadway. On 11 February 2012, Phantom of the Opera played its 10,000th show on Broadway. With over 14,200 London productions it is the second longest-running West End musical. The Broadway production closed on 16 April 2023, having played 13,981 performances, the most in Broadway history.\nAspects of Love followed in 1989, a musical based on the story by David Garnett. The lyrics were by Don Black and Charles Hart and the original production was directed by Trevor Nunn. Aspects had a run of four years in London, but closed after less than a year on Broadway. It has since gone on a tour of the UK. It is famous for the song \"Love Changes Everything\", which was performed by Michael Ball in both the West End and Broadway casts. It stayed in the UK Singles Chart for 14 weeks, peaking at number 2 and becoming Ball's signature tune.\n\n1990s\nLloyd Webber was asked to write a song for the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona and he composed \"Amigos Para Siempre \u2014 Friends for Life\" with Don Black providing the lyrics. This song was performed by Sarah Brightman and Jos\u00e9 Carreras.\nLloyd Webber had toyed with the idea of writing a musical based on Billy Wilder's critically acclaimed movie, Sunset Boulevard, since seeing the film in the early 1970s, but the project did not come to fruition until after the completion of Aspects of Love when the composer finally managed to secure the rights from Paramount Pictures, The composer worked with two collaborators, as he had done on Aspects of Love; this time Christopher Hampton and Don Black shared equal credit for the book and lyrics. Sunset Boulevard opened at the Adelphi Theatre in London on 12 July 1993, and ran for 1,529 performances.\nIn 1994, Sunset Boulevard became a successful Broadway show, opening with the largest advance in Broadway history, and winning seven Tony Awards that year. Even so, by its closing in 1997, \"it had not recouped its reported $13 million investment.\" From 1995 to 2000, Lloyd Webber wrote the Matters of Taste column in The Daily Telegraph where he reviewed restaurants and hotels, and these were illustrated by Lucinda Rogers.\nIn 1998, Lloyd Webber released a film version of Cats, which was filmed at the Adelphi Theatre in London. David Mallet directed the film, and Gillian Lynne choreographed it. The cast consisted of performers who had been in the show before, including Ken Page (the original Old Deuteronomy on Broadway), Elaine Paige (original Grizabella in London) and John Mills as Gus: the Theatre Cat.\nIn 1998, Whistle Down the Wind made its debut, a musical written with lyrics supplied by Jim Steinman. Originally opening in Washington, Lloyd Webber was reportedly not happy with the casting or Harold Prince's production and the show was subsequently revised for a London staging directed by Gale Edwards. The production included the Boyzone number-one hit \"No Matter What\", which remained at the top of the UK charts for three weeks. His The Beautiful Game opened in London and has never been seen on Broadway. The show had a respectable run at The Cambridge Theatre in London. The show was re-worked into a new musical, The Boys in the Photograph, which had its world premi\u00e8re at The Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts in April 2008.\n\n2000s\nHaving achieved great popular success in musical theatre, Lloyd Webber was referred to by The New York Times in 2001 as \"the most commercially successful composer in history\". In 2002 he turned producer, bringing the musical Bombay Dreams to London. With music by Indian Music composer A.R. Rahman and lyrics by Don Black, it ran for two years at the Apollo Victoria Theatre. A revised Broadway production at the Broadway Theatre two years later ran for only 284 performances. On 16 September 2004, his production of The Woman in White opened at the Palace Theatre in London. It ran for 19 months and 500 performances. A revised production opened on Broadway at the Marquis Theatre on 17 November 2005. Garnering mixed reviews from critics, due in part to the frequent absences of the show's star Maria Friedman due to breast cancer treatment, it closed only a brief three months later on 19 February 2006.\nLloyd Webber produced a staging of The Sound of Music, which d\u00e9buted in November 2006. He made the controversial decision to choose an unknown to play leading lady Maria, who was found through the BBC's reality television show How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria?, in which he was a judge. The winner of the show was Connie Fisher. A 2006 project, The Master and Margarita, was abandoned in 2007.\n\nIn September 2006, Lloyd Webber was named a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors with Zubin Mehta, Dolly Parton, Steven Spielberg, and Smokey Robinson. He was recognised for his outstanding contribution to American performing arts. He attended the ceremony on 3 December 2006; it aired on 26 December 2006. On 11 February 2007, Lloyd Webber was featured as a guest judge on the reality television show Grease: You're the One that I Want!.\nBetween April and June 2007, he appeared in BBC One's Any Dream Will Do!, which followed the same format as How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?. Its aim was to find a new Joseph for his revival of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. Lee Mead won the contest. Viewers' telephone voting during the series raised more than \u00a3500,000 for the BBC's annual Children in Need charity appeal, according to host Graham Norton on air during the final.\nIn 2007, Lloyd Webber's cat, Otto, leaped onto his Clavinova piano and \"destroyed the entire score for the new 'Phantom' in one fell swoop\". The Phantom in question was The Phantom of Manhattan, a planned sequel to The Phantom of the Opera. On 1 July 2007, Lloyd Webber presented excerpts from his musicals as part of the Concert for Diana held at Wembley Stadium, London, an event organised to celebrate the life of Princess Diana almost 10 years after her death. BBC Radio 2 broadcast a concert of music from the Lloyd Webber musicals on 24 August 2007. Denise Van Outen introduced songs from Whistle Down the Wind, The Beautiful Game, Tell Me on a Sunday, The Woman in White, Evita and Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat \u2013 as well as Rodgers and Hammerstein's The Sound of Music, which Lloyd Webber revived in 2006 at the London Palladium, and the 2002 musical Bombay Dreams.\n\nIn April 2008, Lloyd Webber reprised his role as judge, this time in the BBC musical talent show I'd Do Anything. The show followed a similar format to its Maria and Joseph predecessors, this time involving a search for an actress to play the role of Nancy in a West End production of Lionel Bart's Oliver!, a musical based on the Charles Dickens' novel Oliver Twist. The show also featured a search for three young actors to play and share the title character's role, but the show's main focus was on the search for Nancy. The role was won by Jodie Prenger despite Lloyd Webber's stated preference for one of the other contestants; the winners of the Oliver role were Harry Stott, Gwion Wyn-Jones and Laurence Jeffcoate. Also in April 2008, Lloyd Webber was featured on the U.S. talent show American Idol, acting as a mentor when the 6 finalists had to select one of his songs to perform for the judges that week.\nLloyd Webber accepted the challenge of managing the UK's entry for the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest, to be held in Moscow. In early 2009 a series, called Eurovision: Your Country Needs You, was broadcast to find a performer for a song that he would compose for the competition. Jade Ewen won the right to represent Britain, winning with \"It's My Time\", by Lloyd Webber and Diane Warren. At the contest, Lloyd Webber accompanied her on the piano during the performance. The United Kingdom finished fifth in the contest.\nOn 8 October 2009, Lloyd Webber launched the musical Love Never Dies at a press conference held at Her Majesty's Theatre, where the original Phantom has been running since 1986. Also present were Sierra Boggess, who had been cast as Christine Daa\u00e9, and Ramin Karimloo, who portrayed Phantom, a role he had recently played in the West End.\n\n2010s\nFollowing the opening of Love Never Dies, Lloyd Webber again began a search for a new musical theatre performer in the BBC One series Over the Rainbow. He cast the winner, Danielle Hope, in the role of Dorothy Gale, and a dog to play Toto in his forthcoming stage production of The Wizard of Oz. He and lyricist and composer Tim Rice wrote a number of new songs for the production to supplement the songs from the film.\n\nOn 1 March 2011, The Wizard of Oz opened at The Palladium Theatre, starring Hope as Dorothy Gale and Michael Crawford as the Wizard of Oz. In 2012, Lloyd Webber fronted a new ITV primetime show Superstar which gave the UK public the chance to decide who would play the starring role of Jesus in an arena tour of Jesus Christ Superstar. The arena tour started in September 2012 and also starred comedian Tim Minchin as Judas Iscariot, former Spice Girl Melanie C as Mary Magdalene and BBC Radio 1 DJ Chris Moyles as Herod Antipas. Tickets for most venues went on sale on 18 May 2012.\nIn 2013, Lloyd Webber reunited with Christopher Hampton and Don Black on Stephen Ward the Musical. For his next project, a 2015 musical adaptation of the 2003 film School of Rock, auditions were held for children aged nine to fifteen in cooperation with the School of Rock music education program, which predated the film by several years.\nIn April 2016, the English National Opera staged a revival of Sunset Boulevard at the London Coliseum. The limited run, semi-staged production directed by Lonny Price brought Glenn Close to reprise her star turn as Norma Desmond, which was her first time performing the role in London; she had originated the role in Los Angeles in December 1993 and then on Broadway in November 1994 (which won her the 1995 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical). The 2016 London revival was so well-received that the production transferred to the Palace Theatre on Broadway in February 2017, making Lloyd Webber the first musical-theatre composer since 1953 to have four musicals running simultaneously on Broadway \u2013 a feat that his heroes Rodgers and Hammerstein had previously achieved.\nLloyd Webber's memoir, Unmasked, was published in 2018. On 9 September 2018, Lloyd Webber, along with Tim Rice and John Legend each won an Emmy for Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert. With this win, Lloyd Webber, Rice and Legend joined the list of people who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards. Lloyd Webber wrote the song \"Beautiful Ghosts\" with Taylor Swift for the film adaptation of Cats, produced by Greg Wells and released in December 2019. In an interview in August 2020, Lloyd Webber called the film \"ridiculous\" in the ways that it changed the musical: \"The problem with the film was that Tom Hooper decided that he didn't want anybody involved in it who was involved in the original show.\" He said that seeing the film caused him to get a dog.\n\n2020s\nLloyd Webber's new version of Cinderella opened at the Gillian Lynne Theatre in the West End in 2021. The opening, which was originally set to take place in August 2020, was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on a book by Emerald Fennell, Lloyd Webber wrote: \"Emerald Fennell has written something truly exciting and original, and the moment I read her outline I knew I'd found my latest collaborator.\" He garnered press attention in July 2021 for saying that he was \"prepared to be arrested\" to open Cinderella to full houses in spite of rising Covid cases and in defiance of Government advice. A 2021 feature in Variety suggested: Lloyd Webber, at 73, appears to have been reanimated creatively in recent years. Both School of Rock and Cinderella earned him some of the best reviews of his career and had a lightness and wit that had been missing from his work. They came after a grueling period in the wilderness, one characterized by failures, disappointments and missteps. ... It seemed, for a time, as though the Lloyd Webber formula, which relied on swooning, rapturous melodies and razzle-dazzle, had grown stale.\nIn 2022, Lloyd Webber appeared alongside Lin-Manuel Miranda in the BBC Platinum Jubilee Concert for Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II. They initially appeared singing alternative words to \"The King's Song\" from Jesus Christ Superstar and \"Any Dream Will Do\" from Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat and \"The Phantom of the Opera\" from The Phantom of the Opera were parts of the musical theatre section.\nIn 2023, Lloyd Webber was one of twelve composers asked to write a new piece for the coronation of Charles III and Camilla. His anthem, \"Make a Joyful Noise\", was performed during the enthronement of Queen Camilla.\n\nAccusations of plagiarism\nAmong the accusations of plagiarism that Lloyd Webber has received, the Dutch composer Louis Andriessen stated that he: \"has yet to think up a single note; in fact, the poor guy's never invented one note by himself. That's rather poor\". Lloyd Webber's biographer, John Snelson, acknowledged a similarity between the andante movement of Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto in E minor and the Jesus Christ Superstar song \"I Don't Know How to Love Him\", but wrote that Lloyd Webber:\n\n...brings a new dramatic tension to Mendelssohn's original melody through the confused emotions of Mary Magdalene. The opening theme may be Mendelssohn, but the rhythmic and harmonic treatment along with new lines of highly effective melodic development are Lloyd Webber's. The song works in its own right as its many performers and audiences can witness.\nAn accusation of plagiarism regarded the 1971 Pink Floyd album Meddle. The sixth track of the album, \"Echoes\", has a riff on which Lloyd Webber allegedly based the opening organ riff in \"The Phantom of the Opera\". The two riffs share very similar notes and the order of the notes played. Lloyd Webber's pipe organ riff from \"Phantom of the Opera\" plays D, C\u266f, C, B, A\u266f, then ascending A\u266f, B, C, C\u266f, D. Pink Floyd's \"Echoes\" plays C\u266f, C, B, A\u266f, A, then ascending A, A\u266f, B, C, C\u266f. Pink Floyd bassist and co-lead vocalist Roger Waters pointed this out and said it was \"probably actionable\", but stated that he did not care to take it to court.\nNoting similarities between Lloyd Webber's \"The Music of the Night\" and a recurring melody in Giacomo Puccini's 1910 opera, La fanciulla del West (The Girl of the Golden West), in 1987 the Puccini estate filed a lawsuit against Lloyd Webber, accusing him of plagiarism. The case was settled out of court, but details were not released to the public. The songwriter Ray Repp claimed in a court case that Lloyd Webber had stolen a melody from his own song \"Till You\", but the court ruled in Lloyd Webber's favour.\n\nPersonal life\nLloyd Webber has been married three times. He married first Sarah Hugill on 24 July 1971; they divorced on 14 November 1983. Together they had two children, a daughter and a son:\n\nImogen Lloyd Webber (born 31 March 1977)\nNicholas Lloyd Webber (2 July 1979 \u2013 25 March 2023)\n\nHe then married English soprano Sarah Brightman on 22 March 1984 in Hampshire. He cast Brightman in the lead role in his musical The Phantom of the Opera, among other notable roles. They divorced on 3 January 1990, but have remained close friends and have also continued to work together.\nThirdly, he married Madeleine Gurdon in Westminster on 9 February 1991. They have three children, two sons and one daughter, all of whom were born in London:\n\nAlastair Adam Lloyd Webber (born 3 May 1992)\nWilliam Richard Lloyd Webber (born 24 August 1993)\nIsabella Aurora Lloyd Webber (born 30 April 1996).\nLloyd Webber and his third wife Madeleine founded the Watership Down Stud in 1992. In 1996, they expanded their equestrian holdings by purchasing Kiltinan Castle Stud near Fethard in County Tipperary, Ireland. They were invited to ride in the King's procession at Royal Ascot 2023.\nIn a 1971 interview with The New York Times, Lloyd Webber said he is an agnostic. He also said he views Jesus as \"one of the great figures of history\".\nHe is a lifelong supporter of London-based football club Leyton Orient F.C., just like his younger brother Julian.\nIn late 2009, Lloyd Webber had surgery for early-stage prostate cancer, but had to be readmitted to hospital with post-operative infection in November. In January 2010, he declared he was cancer-free. He had his prostate completely removed as a preventative measure.\nIn 2023, Lloyd Webber's son Nicholas died at the age of 43 after an 18-month battle with gastric cancer.\nLloyd Webber has a house in Eaton Square in Belgravia, London; in 2024 he revealed he had had his house blessed by a priest in an attempt to displace a \"poltergeist\" that was haunting the property.\n\nWealth\nThe Sunday Times Rich List 2006 ranked him the 87th-richest person in Britain with an estimated fortune of \u00a3700 million. His wealth increased to \u00a3750 million in 2007, but the publication ranked him 101st in 2008. The Sunday Times Rich List of 2019 saw him ranked the richest musician in the UK (overtaking Paul McCartney) with a fortune of \u00a3820 million ($1.074 billion). He lives at Sydmonton Court, Hampshire, and owns much of nearby Watership Down.\nLloyd Webber is an art collector, with a passion for Victorian painting. An exhibition of works from his collection was presented at the Royal Academy in 2003 under the title Pre-Raphaelite and Other Masters \u2013 The Andrew Lloyd Webber Collection. In 2006, Lloyd Webber planned to sell Portrait of Angel Fern\u00e1ndez de Soto by Pablo Picasso to benefit the Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation. In November 2006, he withdrew the painting from auction after a claim that the previous owner had been forced to sell it under duress in Nazi Germany. An out-of-court settlement was reached, where the foundation retained ownership rights. On 23 June 2010, the painting was sold at auction for \u00a334.7 million to an anonymous telephone bidder.\n\nCharity\nLloyd Webber is involved in a number of charitable activities, including the Elton John AIDS Foundation, Nordoff Robbins, Prostate Cancer UK and War Child. In 1992, he started the Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation which supports the arts, culture, and heritage of the UK.\nIn 2013, the Andrew Lloyd Webber Programme was launched to aid the Music in Secondary Schools Trust (MiSST), which aims to give every child at participating schools across the UK the opportunity to study a musical instrument as part of the curriculum. He told LBC: \"What music does in these schools, isn't actually necessarily about trying to make the children musicians. But what it does, is it really helps them as people.\"\nIn 2014, Lloyd Webber designed a Cats-themed Paddington Bear statue, which was located in Chinatown, London (one of 50 placed around London), with the statues auctioned to raise funds for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC).\n\nPolitics\nLloyd Webber was made a life peer in 1997, sitting for the Conservative Party. By the end of 2015, he had voted only 33 times in the House of Lords. Politically, Lloyd Webber has supported the Conservatives, allowing his song \"Take That Look Off Your Face\" to be used on a party promotional film seen by an estimated one million people before the 2005 general election. In August 2014, Lloyd Webber was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September's referendum on that issue.\nIn October 2015, Lloyd Webber was involved in a contentious House of Lords vote over proposed cuts to tax credits, voting with the Government in favour of the plan. Lloyd Webber was denounced by his critics because he flew in from abroad on his personal plane to vote, when his voting record was scant. In October 2017, Lloyd Webber retired from the House of Lords, stating that his busy schedule was incompatible with the demands of Parliament considering the upcoming crucial Brexit legislation.\nIn July 2021, he told Good Morning Britain that he would never vote for the Conservatives again, due to their handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and poor treatment of the arts sector during that time.\n\nAwards and honours\nLloyd Webber was knighted in the Queen's 1992 Birthday Honours for services to the arts. He was given a life peerage in the 1997 New Year Honours and created Baron Lloyd-Webber, of Sydmonton in the County of Hampshire, on 18 February 1997. He is properly styled \"The Lord Lloyd-Webber\"; the title is hyphenated, although his surname is not. He sat as a Conservative member of the House of Lords until his retirement from the House on 17 October 2017.\nOn St George's Day 2024, he was appointed a Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter (KG).\n\nTheatre credits\nNote: Music composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber unless otherwise noted.\n\nFilm adaptations\nThere have been a number of film adaptations of Lloyd Webber's musicals: Jesus Christ Superstar (1973), directed by Norman Jewison; Evita (1996), directed by Alan Parker; The Phantom of the Opera (2004), directed by Joel Schumacher and co-produced by Lloyd Webber; and Cats (2019), directed by Tom Hooper and executive produced by Lloyd Webber. Cats (1998), Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat (1999), Jesus Christ Superstar (2000) and By Jeeves (2001) have been adapted into made-for-television films that have been released on DVD and VHS and often air on BBC.\nA special performance of The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall for the 25th anniversary was broadcast live to cinemas in early October 2011 and later released on DVD and Blu-ray in February 2012. The same was also done with a reworked version of Love Never Dies. Filmed in Melbourne, Australia, it received a limited cinema release in the US and Canada in 2012, to see if it would be viable to bring the show to Broadway.\n\nOther works\nGumshoe (1971) - film score\nThe Odessa File (1974) \u2013 Film score.\nVariations (1978) \u2013 A set of musical variations on Niccol\u00f2 Paganini's Caprice in A minor that Lloyd Webber composed for his brother, cellist Julian. This album featured fifteen rock musicians including guitarist Gary Moore and pianist Rod Argent and reached number 2 in the UK album chart upon its release. It was later combined with Tell Me on a Sunday to form one show, Song and Dance. Lloyd Webber also used variation five as the basis for Unexpected Song in Song and Dance. The main theme is used as the theme music to The South Bank Show.\nRequiem (1985) \u2013 A classical choral work composed in honour of his father, William.\nWatership Down (1999) \u2013 Lloyd Webber and Mike Batt, main soundtrack composer of the animated series adaptation of Richard Adams' novel of the same name, composed the song \"Fields of Sun\". The actual song was never used on the show, nor was it available on the CD soundtrack that was released at the time. He was however still credited for the unused song in the show's opening titles.\n\nDiscography\nMusicals and show recordings\n\nThe Likes of Us (1965)\nJoseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat (1968)\nJesus Christ Superstar (1970)\nJeeves (1975)\nEvita (1976)\nTell Me on a Sunday (1979)\nCats (1981)\nSong and Dance (1982)\nStarlight Express (1984)\nThe Phantom of the Opera (1986)\nAspects of Love (1989)\nSunset Boulevard (1993)\nWhistle Down the Wind (1998)\nThe Beautiful Game (2000)\nThe Woman in White (2004)\nLove Never Dies (2010)\nThe Wizard of Oz (2011)\nStephen Ward (2013)\nSchool of Rock (2015)\n Cinderella (2021)\nBad Cinderella (2023)\nOther albums\n\nVariations (1978)\nVariations with London Philharmonic Orchestra (1986)\nSymphonic Suites (2021)\n\nSee also\nView of Geelong by Eugene von Guerard, 1856 painting once owned by Lloyd Webber\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nPre-Raphaelite and Other Masters: The Andrew Lloyd Webber Collection \u2013 Royal Academy of Arts, London 2003 ISBN 1-903973-39-2\nCats on a Chandelier \u2013 Coveney, M (1999), Hutchinson, London\nOh What a Circus \u2013 Rice, Tim (1999), Hodder & Stoughton, London\nAndrew Lloyd Webber \u2013 Snelson, John (2004), Yale University Press, New Haven CT.

West of this point, Artesia Boulevard becomes Gould Avenue and later 27th Street. The South Bay Galleria is located at the intersection with Hawthorne Boulevard. The westernmost segment of Artesia Boulevard passes through the cities of Hermosa Beach, Manhattan Beach, Redondo Beach, Lawndale, Torrance, Gardena and Los Angeles. Artesia Boulevard breaks off briefly at Avalon Boulevard, and much of this portion of Artesia Boulevard parallels SR 91. After reuniting, the easternmost segment of Artesia Boulevard passes through Carson, Compton, Long Beach, Bellflower, Cerritos, and La Mirada. Artesia Boulevard then crosses the county line upon entering Buena Park and also enters the city Fullerton as Artesia Avenue.\nArtesia Avenue terminates at Gilbert Street in Fullerton near the Fullerton Airport.\n\nHistory and landmarks\nThe road was laid out as state highway as early as 1882, when a newspaper man advised \"I was requested by several parties in Artesia to state that the road recently declared a public highway from Artesia to Anaheim and Westminister has no bridge across Coyote Creek, and the two fords are through private property, the approaches to which are very steep, and after heavy rains, almost impassable and very dangerous.\" A bridge was constructed sometime before 1893.\n\nA 1923 real-estate development ad offering lots from the Acposos Park subdivision fronting Artesia claimed that \"Artesia Boulevard is a hotbed of subdivision activity.\" The Southland Home Gardens subdivision on Artesia near Anaheim Boulevard opened in 1924, in close proximity to an oil derrick, and simultaneously with an Artesia Boulevard Improvement Association.\nThe section in Cerritos was a truck route until 1974 when the city council voted to prohibit trucks to reduce dust and road noise.\nThe intersection of Artesia and Pioneer Boulevards is the center of a Little India, a South Asian-American community and associated Indian food restaurants.\n\nTransportation\nArtesia Boulevard is serviced by Long Beach Transit line 141 between the Metro A Line station (located near its intersection with Acacia Avenue in Compton) and Los Cerritos Center, and Torrance Transit line 13 between the A Line station and Redondo Beach.\nThe southern end of the Metro J Line, Harbor Gateway Transit Center, was formerly named Artesia Transit Center, based on nearby Artesia Boulevard.\nThe intersection of Artesia Boulevard and Vermont Avenue is the southern terminus of the Dominguez Channel Bike Path.\n\nSister city\nThrough the sister cities project, there is an Artesia Boulevard in Koudekerk ann den Rijn, Netherlands, as well as a Kouderkerk Street in Artesia.\n\n\n== References ==","14":"The Arrowhead Trail or Arrowhead Highway was the first all-weather road in the Western United States that connected Los Angeles, California with Salt Lake City, Utah by way of Las Vegas, Nevada. Built primarily during the auto trails period of the 1910s, prior to the establishment of the United States Numbered Highway System, the road was replaced in 1926 by U.S. Route 91 (US 91) and subsequently Interstate 15 (I-15). Small portions of the route in California, Nevada (Las Vegas Boulevard) and Utah are sometimes still referred to by the name, or as Arrow Highway.\n\nHistory\nStarting in 1915, auto racing champion Charles H. Bigelow drove the entire route many times to generate publicity for the road.\nThe Arrowhead Trail initially took a longer route via present U.S. Route 95 and former U.S. Route 66 between Las Vegas and Needles, California, as the more direct Old Spanish Trail was in very poor condition. The \"Silver Lake cutoff\", which would save about 90 miles (145 km), was proposed by 1920, and completed in 1925 as an oiled road by San Bernardino County.\nBoth the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads and the State of Nevada urged the inclusion of the cutoff route into each state's highway systems, the former as part of the federal aid highway connecting Salt Lake City and Los Angeles, and the California State Legislature did that in 1925, with it becoming an extension of Route 31. (Across the state line in Nevada, State Route 6 continued through Las Vegas to Arizona.) The initial plan for the U.S. Highway system simply stated that Route No. 91 would run from Las Vegas \"to an intersection with Route No. 60\" (which became US 66 in 1926), but in 1926 the cutoff was chosen, ending at US 66 at Daggett, just east of Barstow.\nThe original routing south from Las Vegas to Needles later became part of US 95 in 1940. The new \"cutoff route\" was added to the federal-aid secondary system in 1926, which helped pay for a mid-1930s widening and paving, including some realignments (parts of the old road are now known as Arrowhead Trail). The new routing generally followed the present I-15, except through Baker (where it used Baker Boulevard) and into Barstow (where it followed former SR 58 to First Avenue, ending at Main Street, which carried US 66). It entered San Bernardino on Cajon Boulevard, then followed the route of Arrow Highway between San Bernardino and Los Angeles. This route is still called Arrow Route or Arrow Highway through parts of Rancho Cucamonga, Upland, Montclair and Claremont as well as other cities between Irwindale and San Bernardino.\nThe Clark County, Nevada sections of the trail are marked by Nevada Historical Markers 168 and 197.\nA monument to the Arrowhead Trail lies across from the north end of the Terrible's Hotel & Casino [formerly the Gold Strike Hotel and Gambling Hall] property's entrance in Jean, Nevada.  It is from here that Las Vegas Boulevard begins and proceeds north to the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nGallery\nCurrent route names\nCalifornia State Route 91\nInterstate 15\nNevada State Route 169\nLas Vegas Boulevard\n\nSee also\nList of auto trails\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nArrowhead Trail article on americanroads.com","15":"Atlantic Boulevard\/Atlantic Avenue\/Los Robles Avenue is a major north\u2013south thoroughfare in eastern Los Angeles County, California.\n\nRoute\nThe street passes through the cities of Alhambra, Monterey Park, East Los Angeles, Eastside Los Angeles, Commerce, Vernon, Maywood, Bell, Cudahy, South Gate, Lynwood, Compton, and Long Beach. \nAtlantic Boulevard starts off as a southerly continuation of Los Robles Avenue at Huntington Drive in northern Alhambra, and ends on East Ocean Boulevard in Downtown Long Beach.

Aviation Boulevard also intersects with Century Boulevard, El Segundo Boulevard, Imperial Highway, Rosecrans Boulevard, and Artesia Boulevard.\nThe northern end is a continuation of Florence Avenue at Manchester Avenue in Inglewood.\n\nTransportation\nBus routes on Aviation Boulevard include  Santa Monica Transit lines 3 and Rapid 3, Culver City Transit lines 6 and Rapid 6, Beach Cities Transit line 109, and Torrance Transit line 8.  The Metro C Line operates a station under Interstate 105.\n\n\n== References ==","18":"State Route 39 (SR 39) is a state highway in the U.S. state of California that travels through Orange and Los Angeles counties. Its southern terminus is at Pacific Coast Highway (SR 1), in Huntington Beach. SR 39's northern terminus is at Islip Saddle on Angeles Crest Highway (SR 2) in the Angeles National Forest, but its northernmost 4.5-mile (7.2 km) segment (including the connection with SR 2) has been closed to public highway traffic since 1978 due to a massive mud and rockslide.\nOfficially, the highway is broken into pieces. Caltrans has not adopted or signed the segment between La Habra and West Covina. Caltrans has also relinquished a portion of SR 39 in Buena Park from Stanton Avenue in Buena Park to Interstate 5 in 2013, as well as those segments within the cities of Azusa by 2010, Covina by 2010, and West Covina by 2013. Since 2001, a portion of SR 39 that runs through the city of Stanton has been considered for relinquishment to the city. If so, the portion that runs through the city of Anaheim will still be state controlled.\nMajor places of interest along SR 39 are Knott's Berry Farm, an amusement park; Adventure City, another amusement park targeted for children; Huntington Beach, a local beach; a Medieval Times location; the Buena Park Auto Center; and the Westridge Golf Course in La Habra.\n\nRoute description\nSR 39 begins at SR 1 (Pacific Coast Highway) in Huntington Beach and runs north along Beach Boulevard to Whittier Boulevard in La Habra, with the exception of the segment between the southern city limit of Buena Park and Interstate 5, which was relinquished to the city in 2013. SR 39 then turns east along Whittier Boulevard to Harbor Boulevard, taking over a former segment of SR 72, while the remaining segment SR 72 remains on Whittier Boulevard west of Beach Boulevard.\nThe segment from the Whittier\u2013Harbor intersection to the San Bernardino Freeway (Interstate 10) in West Covina is not officially designated by Caltrans (as indicated by an \"END 39\" sign at the Whittier\u2013Harbor intersection). Under California Streets and Highways Code \u00a7 339 (d), the traversable route takes SR 39 along Harbor Boulevard north, Fullerton Road north, and then Colima Road west to Azusa Avenue in Hacienda Heights. SR 39 would then continue north on Azusa Avenue through the City of Industry to Interstate 10.\nAdopted SR 39 then resumes and signs for SR 39 appear on Azusa Avenue from its junction with Interstate 10 in West Covina, and through Covina to First Street in the city of Azusa just north of Interstate 210. The route then runs as a couplet (composed of two one-way streets), with northbound traffic on Azusa Avenue, and southbound traffic on San Gabriel Avenue, to Sierra Madre Avenue where the two one-way streets converge to form San Gabriel Canyon Road. Although relinquished in the cities of West Covina, Covina, and Azusa, SR 39 shields remain on this segment of the highway.\nState maintenance of SR 39 begins again along San Gabriel Canyon Road at the north limit of Azusa. The highway winds through the San Gabriel Mountains in the Angeles National Forest for 22.6 miles (36.4 km) until it reaches a gate barring the road 0.25 miles (0.40 km) north of Crystal Lake Road in the Crystal Lake Recreation Area. The last few miles of the route, including the connection to SR 2, are closed to public highway traffic, as the roadbed has been closed since 1978, due to major rock slides that year and again in 2005 which damaged more of the remaining roadbed. \nA replacement of the section north of East Fork Road, in the next canyon to the east, was partly built in 1936 and 1961, but was never completed. The section includes one bridge and two tunnels; it was never used by automobile or truck traffic. In one local hiking guide the section is identified as the \"Road to Nowhere\" and the \"Convict Road\", although the official name is the Shoemaker Road and was planned to be an escape route in times of nuclear warfare. A ca. 1967 replacement, much closer to the existing alignment, was also stopped prematurely, and so the middle of the segment between East Fork Road and the closure gate, with its many hairpin curves, still exists.\nSR 39 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and the urban portions of SR 39 are part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 39 is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System, but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation.\n\nHistory\nLa Habra to West Covina connection\nAlthough defined to be a continuous route in the California Streets and Highway Code, the segment from Whittier Boulevard in La Habra to West Covina is not officially adopted or signed by Caltrans. This is indicated at the intersection of Whittier Boulevard and Harbor Boulevard, where an \"END 39\" sign appears.\nPrior to the present before reaching Harbor Boulevard, SR 39 continued north from Whittier Boulevard along Hacienda Road to the Los Angeles\/Orange County line then north on Hacienda Boulevard and Glendora Avenue to US 60, 70, and 99 (Garvey Avenue, now Interstate 10) in West Covina. It then continued east with US 60, 70, and 99 to Azusa Avenue where it turned north to follow the present alignment as described beginning in the fourth paragraph of the preceding section. The Hacienda Glendora segment can still be seen as Route 39 on some maps.\nPrior to 1991, Harbor Boulevard became Fullerton Road northbound from the Los Angeles\/Orange County Line, through the Puente Hills as a one-lane winding road into Rowland Heights. However, due to complaints of nearby residents due to the increased volume of traffic, a straighter, wider stub was built slightly to the east, and was named Harbor Boulevard. This route is under consideration to become part of SR 39 to complete the gap.\nThe new Harbor Boulevard was opened to the public early in 1992, and is now the primary corridor between Orange County and Rowland Heights, although the original winding Fullerton Road segment still exists as a strictly residential street.\nThe definition of Route 39 in the California Streets and Highway Code was thus changed accordingly, and the traversable route to fill the Route 39 gap would be via Harbor Boulevard north, Fullerton Road north, and then Colima Road west to Azusa Avenue in Hacienda Heights. Route 39 would then continue north on Azusa Avenue through the City of Industry to Interstate 10 in West Covina. This segment however has yet to be officially designated by Caltrans.\n\nClosed northern segment to Islip Saddle\nAfter the road's completion, there were frequent closures along SR 39 through the San Gabriel Valley. During the winter of 1978, following a period of heavy rainfall, a rockslide damaged the northernmost 4.5-mile (7.2 km) stretch of SR 39 near Crystal Lake to the road's terminus at SR 2, at Islip Saddle. This resulted in the permanent closure of a 6.1 mi (9.8 km) portion of SR 39. In 1990, Caltrans started maintaining the damaged sections by restoring culverts and adding berms. The transit agency offered the closed portion of the road to the United States Forest Service, which would only accept it if the road was returned to a wild state, a proposition considered to be more costly than reconstruction. During the 1997\u201398 El Ni\u00f1o event, heavy rainfall caused another rockslide that damaged sections still under construction. Following a Caltrans study, which determined that the road's reopening would not harm the environment, the closed portion was reopened as a service road and emergency route in February 2003. In June 2006, California authorized funding to conduct a three-year-long environmental impact report. It was predicted that a reopened SR 39 would reduce travel time by around 50% between Mount Waterman and Pasadena, shortening the drive from about two hours to one. According to Caltrans, work could begin in 2009 on reconstruction, as well as the installation of safety features to prevent future slides from damaging the roadway. \nThe environmental impact statement was completed in 2009, estimating the project's cost at $32 million (over $45 million in 2023, adjusted for inflation). After the report was released, California Fish and Wildlife informed Caltrans that the road's reconstruction would negatively affect the subspecies of bighorn sheep, the Nelson's bighorn sheep, a protected species in the state. In September 2011, Caltrans canceled plans to reopen the closed portion of SR 39. By that time, the maintenance cost for that portion of the road was $1.3 million per year. Thereafter, the agency tried to transfer responsibility for the entirety of SR 39 north of postmile LA 17.81 (including the closed section) to either the U.S. Forest Service or Los Angeles County, both of which declined for financial reasons, even though both the USFS and the county deemed the route \"essential\". Abandoning the route would not be cost-effective for Caltrans due to, among other reasons, federal environmental restoration requirements related to the presence of bighorn sheep. The proposal was abandoned after opposition by local residents and the county, as well as substantial legal pressure by the Forest Service, who threatened to enforce an old contract that requires Caltrans to completely deconstruct the highway should it refuse to maintain it. After lobbying from the cities of Azusa and Glendora, and support from congresswoman Grace Napolitano, Caltrans restarted plans in 2011 toward reopening the closed section of SR 39. Benefits for the project included another evacuation route for Azusa. On December 15, 2022, Caltrans held a meeting to consider several proposed plans to reopen SR 39. Proposals include a full restoration, minimal restoration for emergency services, a single-lane road, or recreational use. Under the recreational use proposal, the restored route would be closed to general traffic, but would allow for hiking, biking, and other recreational activities.\n\nMajor intersections\nExcept where prefixed with a letter, postmiles were measured on the road as it was in 1964, based on the alignment that existed at the time, and do not necessarily reflect current mileage. R reflects a realignment in the route since then, M indicates a second realignment, L refers to an overlap due to a correction or change, and T indicates postmiles classified as temporary (for a full list of prefixes, see California postmile \u00a7 Official postmile definitions). Segments that remain unconstructed or have been relinquished to local control may be omitted. The numbers reset at county lines; the start and end postmiles in each county are given in the county column.\n\nSee also\nCalifornia Roads portal\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nCaltrans: State Route 39 highway conditions\nCaltrans Traffic Conditions Map\nCalifornia Highway Patrol Traffic Incidents\nCalifornia @ AARoads.com - State Route 39\nCalifornia Highways: SR 39\nMichael Ballard on SR 39\nSR 39 EIR","19":"Balboa Boulevard is a major north\u2013south street in the city of Los Angeles, and it cuts through many communities and is one of the main thoroughfares in the San Fernando Valley.\nThe southern end of Balboa Boulevard starts at Ventura Boulevard in the Encino section of Los Angeles.

It is one of six lines in the Los Angeles Metro Rail system, operated by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Built in four stages between 1986 and 2000, the line cost $4.5 billion.\nThe B Line is one of the city's two fully-underground subway lines (along with the D Line). The two lines share tracks through Koreatown and Downtown Los Angeles. As of 2019, the combined B and D lines averaged 133,413 boardings per weekday.\nIn 2020, Metro renamed all of its lines using letters and colors, with the Red Line becoming the B Line (retaining the red color in its service bullet) and the Purple Line becoming the D Line.\n\nService description\nRoute\nThe B Line is a subway that begins at North Hollywood station in North Hollywood, in the San Fernando Valley. The line turns southeast underneath Cahuenga Pass and passes through Hollywood and Koreatown, traveling east along Hollywood Boulevard and then south along Vermont Avenue. Arriving at Wilshire\/Vermont station, the line merges with the D Line, and the lines continue between Wilshire Boulevard and 7th Street (and briefly Ingraham Street), where the lines interchange with the A and E light rail lines at 7th Street\/Metro Center station. The lines then pass northeast through Downtown Los Angeles, passing through the Financial District, Pershing Square (near the Historic Core), and the Civic Center, before terminating at Union Station.\nThe B Line through Cahuenga Pass roughly follows a branch of the old Pacific Electric system.\n\nHours and frequency\nB Line trains run every day between approximately 4:30 a.m. and midnight. Trains operate every 12 minutes during peak hours. Early morning and night service is approximately every 20 minutes.\n\nStation listing\nThe following table lists the stations of the B Line, from north to south. All stations are located in the city of Los Angeles, California.\n\nRidership\nNote: Ridership figures are for B and D Line combined.\n\nHistory\nThe current B Line is the product of a long-term plan to connect Downtown Los Angeles to central and western portions of the city with a subway system. Original proposals in the 1980s had it running down Wilshire Boulevard to Fairfax Avenue and then north to the San Fernando Valley. Residents in some parts of the city bitterly opposed the subway. A 1985 methane explosion at a Ross Dress for Less clothing store near Fairfax gave Rep. Henry Waxman, who represented the Fairfax District, a reason to derail the project that was opposed by his constituents by prohibiting tunnelling in an alleged \"methane zone\" west of Western on Wilshire. After some political wrangling, a new route was chosen up Vermont Avenue to Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nThe groundbreaking for the first segment of the subway was held on September 29, 1986, on the site of the future Civic Center\/Grand Park station. Today's B Line was built in four minimum operating segments:\n\nMOS-1, consisting of five stations from Union Station to Westlake\/\u200bMacArthur Park, opened on January 30, 1993, as the Red Line. (At this point, the line's operator was still the Southern California Rapid Transit District).\nMOS-2A, consisting of three stations from Westlake\/\u200bMacArthur Park to Wilshire\/Western, opened on July 13, 1996, although only one station on this section (Wilshire\/Vermont) is on today's B Line.\nMOS-2B, consisting of five stations from Wilshire\/Vermont to Hollywood\/Vine, opened on June 12, 1999.\nMOS-3, extending the Red Line from Hollywood\/Vine to North Hollywood, opened on June 24, 2000.\nOverall, the construction of the subway over the four phases cost $4.5 billion.\nOn June 22, 1995, during the construction of MOS-2B, a sinkhole appeared on Hollywood Boulevard, barely missing several workers and causing damage to buildings on the street. Subway construction was delayed during the investigation and repairs of the sinkhole. The contractor on that segment project was replaced, and because of the perceived mismanagement of Red Line construction, in 1998 voters banned the use of existing sales taxes for subway tunnelling.\n\nConstruction of MOS-3, by comparison, proceeded with relatively few issues. Tunnelling from North Hollywood for the subway started in 1995. Workers dug under the Santa Monica Mountains using tunnelling machines. Work progressed an average of 50 to 200 ft (15 to 61 m) daily, performed by work crews round-the-clock six days a week.\nOriginal proposals for the subway system included expansions east from Union Station to East Los Angeles and west from North Hollywood towards the Warner Center transit hub in the San Fernando Valley. Barred from subway tunnelling, Metro turned to other types of mass transit. In the San Fernando Valley, residents passed a law in 1991 mandating that any rail line in the area be built underground, so Metro built a busway (now the G Line) from North Hollywood to Warner Center, which opened on October 29, 2005. East of Union Station, Metro built a light rail line with at-grade and underground segments to East Los Angeles, now part of the E Line, which opened on November 15, 2009.\n\nOperations\nOn Metro Rail's internal timetables, the B Line is called line 802.\n\nMaintenance\nThe B Line operates out of the Division 20 Yard (Santa Fe Yard), located at 320 South Santa Fe Avenue in Downtown Los Angeles. This yard stores the fleet used on the B and D Lines, and where heavy maintenance is performed. Cars reach this yard by continuing past Union Station, making a right turn and surfacing at the Eastern terminus of Ducommun Street. They then travel south to 1st Street, through a washing station, and enter the yard.\n\nRolling stock\nThe B Line uses A650 75 ft (22.86 m) electric multiple unit cars built by Breda in Italy. Trains usually run in six-car configurations during peak hours and four-car configurations otherwise. The cars are maintained in a Metro yard on Santa Fe Avenue near 4th Street alongside the Los Angeles River in downtown Los Angeles.\nIn March 2017, Metro ordered new CRRC HR4000 railcars, which will operate on the B Line when they are delivered. In January 2024, Metro ordered 182 Hyundai Rotem HR5000 trains, allowing for future replacement of all Breda A650 trains as well as expanded train service including a four minute train frequency.\n\nPotential future extensions\nExtension to Arts District\nIn 2010, at the request of L.A. City Councilman Tom LaBonge, Metro staff studied the possibility of adding a station along the west bank of the Los Angeles River to 6th Street and Santa Fe Avenue. The study concluded that such an extension, completed at-grade along Metro-owned right-of-way, could be completed for as little as $90 million.\nThe study suggested an alternative station at the Division 20 Yard north of 4th Street and Santa Fe Avenue. This station would be closer to the residential population of the Arts District. As new turnback tracks will need to be built as part of the D Line Extension (to allow shorter headways), this Arts District extension could possibly be partially completed as part of the Purple Line Extension project, lowering the incremental cost of the station while increasing its usability.\n\nExtensions to the South\nOne of the proposals for the Vermont Transit Corridor being considered by Metro would extend a subway line from Wilshire\/Vermont station down Vermont Avenue to 120th Street. Metro is also considering other types of mass transit for the line, including light rail and busway options.\n\nIncidents\nOn December 22, 2006, a rider accidentally spilled a vial of mercury on the platform at Pershing Square station. He notified the operator on a passenger intercom before boarding a train, but Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department did not know of the spillage until eight hours later. In response, Metro implemented new hazardous materials (Hazmat) training to its field employees and operators.\nOn August 19, 2011, near the Hollywood\/Vine station, an altercation between two passengers resulted in one being fatally stabbed. The suspect was arrested on August 24.\nOn September 4, 2012, a 54-year-old man fell onto the tracks at the North Hollywood station and was hit by an oncoming train. He was rushed to hospital, where he later died.\nOn May 22, 2018, an unidentified man \"probably jumped\" onto the tracks at the 7th St\/Metro Center station and was hit by an oncoming train. He was rushed to a hospital, where he later died. It is unknown if it was suicide or not.\nOn April 20, 2024, a woman in her 50s was stabbed in the throat at the Universal City station shortly after 5am. She was taken to a hospital where she died from her injuries.\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nMTA Home Page\nRed Line news","24":"Beverly Drive is a major north\u2013south roadway in Beverly Hills and Los Angeles.\n\nLocation\nSouth Beverly Drive\nSouth Beverly Drive begins northbound at Harlow Avenue, a small street just north of the Santa Monica Freeway in the city of Los Angeles. It passes through the residential neighborhood of Beverlywood and intersects with Pico Boulevard before entering the city of Beverly Hills at Whitworth Avenue. Between Olympic and Wilshire Boulevards, it becomes markedly commercial, with dining and shopping establishments throughout. This street is the location of the original California Pizza Kitchen.\n\nNorth Beverly Drive\nNorth Beverly Drive begins northbound after Wilshire, with a continuation of luxury stores and restaurants. North of Santa Monica Boulevard it crosses Beverly Gardens Park and enters one of the city's more lavish residential neighborhoods. Before crossing Sunset Boulevard it approaches a broad and notoriously congested three-way intersection with Canon Drive and Lomitas Avenue, with Will Rogers Memorial Park at its northwest corner. At the intersection of Beverly and Sunset lies the historic Beverly Hills Hotel, one of the city's most notable landmarks. It continues northbound to Coldwater Canyon Park and Beverly Hills Fire Station #2, where arterial traffic merges onto Coldwater Canyon Drive and crosses the Santa Monica Mountains to connect with the eastern San Fernando Valley.\nIt is possible to continue north on Beverly by turning left at the merger with Coldwater Canyon and passing west of the park. The terrain becomes noticeably hillier and later mountainous as the street enters the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. Franklin Canyon Reservoir is directly to the east, and later, Franklin Canyon Park with its Upper Franklin Canyon Reservoir.\nThe road ends just north of Desford Drive in Beverly Hills at a private residence.\n\n\n== References ==","25":"Beverly Glen Boulevard is one of six major routes that connect the Westside of Los Angeles to the San Fernando Valley (the other five are the San Diego (405) Freeway, Sepulveda Boulevard, Topanga Canyon Boulevard, Laurel Canyon Boulevard, and Coldwater Canyon Avenue.\nIt starts at Rancho Park Golf Course on Pico Boulevard in West Los Angeles. It proceeds to intersect with Santa Monica and Wilshire boulevards, passing near Century City, Sinai Temple and Los Angeles Country Club. The road marks the eastern border of the Westwood Prosperity Unit development built by Janss Investment Company as the foundation of the Westwood neighborhood of Los Angeles.\n\nAs the road travels further north, it intersects with Sunset Boulevard near UCLA and passes the gated communities of Bel Air and the middle school campus of the Harvard-Westlake School.  The hills through which the boulevard passes north of Sunset and south of Mulholland Drive is known as Beverly Glen. Beverly Glen runs parallel to the wealthy section of Bel-Air and its gated communities. The housing development at Beverly Glen and Mulholland was laid out in the 1950s and was originally known as Glen-Aire.\nAfter passing Mulholland, Beverly Glen Boulevard swerves west and passes through the exclusive hillside homes in Sherman Oaks. \"Stilt Street\" is a row of twenty  stilt houses designed by architect Richard Neutra that perch on the steep hillside above the boulevard. The road ends at Ventura Boulevard in the south end of the Valley. Commuters seeking to go further north into the Valley go one block west to Van Nuys Boulevard which spans most of the Valley's length.\nBeverly Glen Boulevard is east of Sepulveda Boulevard and the San Diego Freeway (I-405).

One of the world's best-known hotels, it is closely associated with Hollywood film stars, rock stars, and celebrities. The hotel has 210 guest rooms and suites and 23 bungalows and the exterior bears the hotel's signature pink and green colors.\nThe Beverly Hills Hotel was established in May 1912, before the city itself was incorporated. The original owners were Margaret J. Anderson, a wealthy widow, and her son, Stanley S. Anderson, who had been managing the Hollywood Hotel. The original hotel was designed by Pasadena architect Elmer Grey in the Mediterranean Revival style. From 1928 to 1932, the hotel was owned by the Interstate Company. In 1941, Hernando Courtright, a vice president of the Bank of America, purchased the hotel with friends including Irene Dunne, Loretta Young, and Harry Warner. Courtright established the Polo Lounge, which is considered to be one of the premier dining spots in Los Angeles, hosting entertainers ranging from the Rat Pack to Humphrey Bogart and Marlene Dietrich. The hotel was first painted its famous pink color during a 1948 renovation to match that period's country club style. The following year, architect Paul Williams added the Crescent Wing.\nThe strict resident owner of the Beverly Hills Hotel from 1958 until his death in 1979 was former Detroit real estate magnate Ben L. Silberstein. In 1986, Marvin Davis bought the hotel from Silberstein's sons-in-law Burt Slatkin and Ivan F. Boesky. On December 30, 1992, the hotel closed for a complete restoration, reopening on June 3, 1995. Since 1996, it has been run as part of the Dorchester Collection owned by the Sultan of Brunei. In 2012, the hotel was named the first historic landmark in Beverly Hills, and two new Presidential Bungalows were added.\nThe song \"Hotel California\" by the American rock band the Eagles is slightly based on the folklore behind the hotel. The cover of the band's album of the same name features a photo of the hotel itself.\n\nHistory\nEarly history\nIn early 1911, Margaret J. Anderson, a wealthy widow, and her son, Stanley S. Anderson, who had been managing the Hollywood Hotel, ordered the construction of the Beverly Hills Hotel, in close proximity to the Burton Green mansion. Burton Green, an oil tycoon and real estate developer, President of the Rodeo Land and Water Company, had purchased land in the foothills of the Santa Monica Mountains, which had once been owned by the Mexican government. He had begun building mansions on the land, including his own residence, investing some $500,000, but was having difficulty selling them. He hired Anderson to build a hotel, which he named Beverly Farms, after his home in Massachusetts, believing that it would attract people to the area, billing it as \"halfway between Los Angeles and the sea\". The Hollywood film industry was taking off at the time, and investors were looking to develop the area.\nA May 11, 1911 edition of the Los Angeles Times announced the news that a \"huge Mission-style hotel\" was to be built by Anderson, with the motto that \"her guests were entitled to the best of everything regardless of cost\".\n\nThe hotel opened May 12, 1912, before the city's existence. Margaret and Stanley took up residence within the hotel grounds. By 1914, Hollywood directors, actors, and actresses, such as Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks, Charlie Chaplin, Gloria Swanson, Buster Keaton, Rudolph Valentino, and Will Rogers, had purchased homes in the area, \"transforming bean fields surrounding The Beverly Hills Hotel into prime real estate\". The city of Beverly Hills was established in 1914. The first five bungalows of the hotel were built in 1915. In 1919, Douglas Fairbanks and his wife, Mary Pickford, bought and expanded a lodge above the hotel, which they named Pickfair. According to one publication, a star would know they would have finally \"made it\" when they received an invitation to dine at Pickfair. Gloria Swanson resided in one of the bungalows of the hotel during her divorce.\n\nIn 1915, the Andersons donated a portion of the hotel's original grounds to the community of Beverly Hills. It was used to create the community's first public park. Originally known as Sunset Park, it is now Will Rogers Memorial Park. An early tradition was the annual Easter egg hunt, put on for the children of the guests and employees. \nSilent film star Harold Lloyd was an early hotel patron, and in 1921, he decided to film a scene at the hotel for A Sailor-Made Man. From 1928 to 1932, the hotel was owned by the Interstate Company. Interstate had to close the hotel during the Great Depression years, although the company leased the bungalows out as rental properties. With Bank of America funding, the hotel reopened in 1932.\n\nThe glamour years\nDuring the 1930s, the Beverly Hills Hotel became increasingly popular with Hollywood film stars. Fred Astaire took a shine to the hotel and enjoyed reading the Daily Variety and the Hollywood Reporter by the pool. Cesar Romero and Carole Lombard were pictured together at the hotel in 1937. In 1938, the Sand and Pool Club was established at the hotel. It proved extremely popular, with white sand imported from Arizona, which made the pool area look like a beach. The following year, it began hosting fashion shows sponsored by local department stores, such as Bullock's Wilshire. In 1940, one of the hotel's long-time patrons, Marlene Dietrich, was instrumental in bringing about a change in policy in the Polo Lounge, which had made it compulsory for women to don skirts, which she refused to wear.\nIn 1941, Hernando Courtright, a vice president of the Bank of America, purchased the hotel with friends. Irene Dunne, Loretta Young, and Harry Warner also became owners of the hotel as a result of their investment with Courtright. Courtright established the Polo Lounge \"in honor of a celebrity band of polo players who toasted victories at the restaurant after matches in the bean fields\". In 1942, Howard Hughes bought up half a dozen of the bungalows and lived there on several occasions throughout the decades. The hotel accommodated his eccentricities, including his request for \"roast beef sandwiches delivered to a nook in a tree\". The Beverly Hills Hotel underwent significant renovation in the late forties when the porte cochere was expanded and painted in stripes. In 1947, Courtright opened the Crystal Room and the Lanai Restaurant, later called The Coterie. The building was first painted its famous pink color in 1948 to match the country club style of the period, and it became known as \"the Pink Palace\". The following year, architect Paul Williams added the Crescent Wing. The Fountain Coffee Shop also opened at this time.\n\nIn 1954, Detroit real estate magnate Ben L. Silberstein offered to buy the hotel for $4 million. The deal finally completed in 1958 for a reported $6 million. Courtright later became the hotelier at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel. The reputation of the Beverly Hills Hotel, as a leading luxury hotel with glamorous patrons, took off during the 1950s and attracted eminent guests, such as the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Princess Margaret and Lord Snowdon, King Albert of Belgium, the Crown Prince of Monaco and Grace Kelly, John Wayne, and Henry Fonda. Elizabeth Taylor, one of the hotel's best-known guests, would stay with her numerous husbands in the bungalows and spent six of her eight honeymoons there. Her father owned an art gallery on the ground floor of the hotel. The Polo Lounge became associated with Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and the Rat Pack, where they held heavy drinking bouts. In 1956, the pool of the hotel and cabana club was a filming location for Designing Woman, starring Gregory Peck and Lauren Bacall. Marilyn Monroe and Yves Montand stayed at the hotel during the production of George Cukor's Let's Make Love. Monroe's favorite bungalow was No. 7. George Hamilton and Rex Harrison enjoyed sunbathing at the hotel; Harrison would sunbathe in the nude in Cabana One and answer the door wearing \"just a handkerchief over his private parts\".\nIn 1963, the comedy picture Who's Been Sleeping in My Bed?, starring Dean Martin, Elizabeth Montgomery, Jill St. John, and Carol Burnett, was shot at the hotel. In the 1970s, John Lennon and Yoko Ono hid out in one of the bungalows for a week. Richard M. Nixon's chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman, and presidential aide John Ehrlichman were eating breakfast in the Polo Lounge when they were informed of the Watergate burglary in 1972. In January 1977, Peter Finch died of a sudden heart attack while sitting in the hotel lobby. Two months later, he was posthumously awarded the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as Howard Beale in the film Network. His costar Faye Dunaway stayed at the hotel after winning the Academy Award for Best Actress for the same film; in one memorable photograph, she was seated by the hotel pool lounging back in a chair surrounded by newspapers and her Oscar trophy. The exterior of the hotel was featured on the album cover art of the Eagles' album Hotel California that same year. Two years later, California Suite was filmed at the hotel.\n\nLater history\nOwner Ben Silberstein died in 1979 and passed the hotel to his two daughters, Muriel Slatkin and Seema Boesky, wife of stock trader Ivan Boesky. Boesky bought the outstanding 5% of stock for a reported fortune and decided to sell, despite Slatkin's desire to keep the hotel. In 1986, Marvin Davis bought the hotel from Boesky. Less than a year later, Davis sold the hotel to the Sultan of Brunei, Hassanal Bolkiah, for $110 million.\nOn December 30, 1992, the hotel closed for a complete restoration, said to be in the region of $100\u2013125 million. The project lasted two and a half years with the hotel reopening on June 3, 1995, with upgrades to furniture and fittings.\nThe hotel is now managed and owned by the Dorchester Collection, organized in 1996 to manage the hotel interests of the Brunei Investment Agency. In 2011, the West Coast regional director for the Dorchester Collection, Edward Mady, became the general manager of the Beverly Hills Hotel, as well as the Hotel Bel-Air. Mady was awarded the 2011 Hospitality Professional of the Year Award from the Food and Beverage Association and Hotels Magazine's 2017 Hotelier of the World award. In 2012, the hotel celebrated its 100-year anniversary and began to remodel its lobby, with the Polo Lounge, pool cabanas and Cabana Cafe, and guest-rooms and suites to be renovated by 2014. The hotel was also named the first historic landmark in Beverly Hills in September 2012. In 2022, John Scanlon became the hotel's general manager.\n\nControversy and boycott\nA boycott of the hotel began in April 2014, when the Sultan of Brunei, part owner of the hotel, began changing Brunei's complex legal system to include aspects of Sharia law, and in particular, codifying the persecution of homosexuals. In protest, a United States national LGBT advocacy organization, the Gill Action Fund, canceled its reservation to hold a conference of major donors at the Beverly Hills Hotel and demanded a refund of its deposit. The hotel management responded by asserting that it does not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.\nFashion designers Brian Atwood and Peter Som subsequently called for wider protests, urging the fashion industry to boycott all the hotels owned by the Dorchester Collection. Meanwhile, the boycott had attracted support from Sir Richard Branson of Virgin Group, as well as numerous Hollywood executives and stars, including Jay Leno and Ellen DeGeneres. A string of organizations joined the boycott, cancelling reservations to hold conferences and other high-profile events at the establishment; travel industry firms signed on to a boycott of all Dorchester Collection hotels. Others, including Russell Crowe and Kim Kardashian, spoke out against the boycott. Crowe said that despite his disapproval of the new laws in Brunei, it is unfair to punish the hardworking employees of the hotel. Similarly, Kardashian published a blog post voicing her criticism of the boycott and expressing her sympathies for the hotel workers. HR Magazine said that the protests are \"misguided\" and will not affect the government policy of Brunei when the Dorchester Collection's annual revenue is $300 million, while the BIA has over $30 billion in assets from oil and gas.\nIn May 2014, the Beverly Hills City Council passed a resolution urging the Sultan of Brunei to sell the hotel. Lili Bosse, the then-mayor of Beverly Hills, welcomed the resolution and added that she had made a \"personal decision\" not to return to the hotel until the situation had been solved. The decision was lauded by Rabbi Laura Geller of Temple Emanuel, where Bosse is a congregant. By then, the Jewish Journal reported that \"more than $2 million worth of events have been canceled at the Beverly Hills Hotel by dozens of groups.\" Dorchester Collection Chief Executive Officer Christopher Cowdray asked the public to consider that many brands are backed by foreign investors. Sharia law exists alongside other normative systems and has been adopted by many other Muslim countries, including Saudi Arabia, which has major investments in the American hospitality industry, including the Four Seasons and Fairmont hotel chains.\nAdweek declared that \"the bad press and protests have tarnished the glamorous image of the Beverly Hills Hotel, one of the most famous hotels in the world\", and added that \"such extreme brand damage will be difficult to repair\".\nThe hotel and other Dorchester properties faced renewed calls for boycott in April 2019, when Brunei made gay sex and adultery punishable by death by stoning. The boycott has attracted support from LA City Comptroller Ron Galperin and more celebrities, including George Clooney and Elton John. The LA City Council passed a resolution to bar the city from conducting business at the hotel and urging city residents not to patronize it. The Dorchester Collection responded by saying they \"do not tolerate any form of discrimination.\" In May 2019, the Sultan of Brunei said that his country's \"de facto moratorium\" on capital punishment would apply to cases under the new laws, and promised to ratify the UN Convention against Torture. Despite this, LA City Councilman Paul Koretz asked the city to continue its boycott of the hotel.\n\nCovid-19 response\nWorking within the Covid-19 pandemic, the hotel has remained open, but was forced to reschedule the events it had planned for the summer and fall of 2020. The hotel engaged in multiple donation campaigns to various organizations, such as the Children's Hospital Los Angeles and the Hollywood Food Coalition. The hotel also fed frontline healthcare workers at L.A. hospitals via the Polo Lounge, an idea stemming from the hotel's general manager, Edward Mady. The hotel also redesigned its sign for the first time in 70 years to honor those same frontline healthcare workers.\n\nArchitecture\nExterior\nJudith Kirkwood of Orange Coast Magazine has stated that \"The Beverly Hills Hotel is such an icon that my friend, Gretchen, and I wondered if it was a mirage when the taxi pulled up in the porte cochere and deposited us on a red carpet, but realized that it was \"more like a peachy pink dream dusted with gold \u2014 and green and white striped accents\".\nThe original main building of the Beverly Hills Hotel was designed by Pasadena architect Elmer Grey, in the Mediterranean Revival style. Built on a prominence above the main road below, it resembled a white colonial palatial mansion or mission, with verandas and arches fitted with wicker furniture, and at the time was set in the countryside. High above the main entrance are three domes, two flanking the center, which are smaller and lower in height, with flags hoisted on them. A trolley-stop pavilion was situated on the western side. The iconic signage and the addition were designed by architect Paul Williams.\n\nThe extensive gardens, covering 12 acres (4.9 ha), were designed by landscape architect Wilbur David Cook. They contain bougainvillea, banana plants, hibiscus, and other tropical flora. Svend Petersen, the Danish-American pool manager at the hotel for forty-two years, became a Hotel Ambassador in 2002. He had notably opened up the pool after hours for the Beatles and taught Faye Dunaway to swim a 1940s freestyle crawl for her appearance in the film Mommie Dearest.\n\nInterior\nA room, known as the Crystal Room, was allocated for small private dinner parties. The principal dining room could accommodate up to 500 people. The children's dining room, which became the El Jardin Restaurant, is the Polo Lounge. The lounge was renovated in 1974 and given a softer design with table lamps and flowers. It is fashioned in peachy pink with dark green booths, each featuring a plug-in phone. The photograph behind the bar depicts Will Rogers and Darryl F. Zanuck, two lounge regulars, playing polo. The menu offers a Neil McCarthy salad, named after the polo-playing millionaire. The hotel has its own bakery and herb garden, makes its own vinegar, and smokes meats. The chef in 2003 was Katsuo Sugiura. In 2007, one large suite was converted into the Bar Nineteen12. The fireplace in the hotel's lobby has a fire going every day of the year.\nA new wing was added to the east side of the main building along Crescent Drive in the late 1940s. The \"Crescent Wing\", as it became known, features mature plantings on the balconies.\n\nRooms and bungalows\nMany of the rooms have their own balcony and are designed in the Beverly Hills Hotel colors of peachy pinks, greens, apricots, and yellows. Several of the more expensive rooms have private patios, Jacuzzis, and their own kitchens.\nFive bungalows were originally added to the gardens in 1915 to provide for families who could return each year with their own staff. As of 2015, the hotel has 23 bungalows set out across the gardens. Bungalows 14-21 are known as \"Bachelor's Row\", due to their association with film stars and their affairs, including Warren Beatty and Orson Welles. In 1990, a private pool and Jacuzzi were added to Bungalow No. 5 to accommodate businessman Walter Annenberg. No.5 had been a favorite of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, who had \"a standing room service order for two bottles of vodka at breakfast, and two more at lunch\". Taylor also liked No. 3, where she stayed during her marriage to Eddie Fisher. Marilyn Monroe favored No. 1 and No. 7. No.1, the most secluded of the bungalows, features an interior described by CNN as \"creamy, lush and traditional, decorated in the manner of one's wealthy grandparents\". No. 7 has become known as \"the \"Norma Jean\". Dietrich ordered a 7 feet (2.1 m) by 8 feet (2.4 m) bed added to No. 10, the bungalow where John Lennon and Yoko Ono stayed in the 1970s. Bungalow 22 was favored by Frank Sinatra and later, by Donald Trump. In 2011, two Presidential Bungalows were established, replacing the tennis courts, with each containing three bedrooms and a private swimming pool and shower. As of 2018, a one-night stay at a bungalow may cost as much as $10,000.\nHoward Hughes permanently kept a bungalow at the hotel, but it was a secret whether he was on the premises or not. Often, the only person who knew Hughes was at the Beverly Hills Hotel was the hotel's chef. Hughes would awaken him in the middle of the night to prepare food for him. It has been alleged that several of the bungalows are haunted. Guests have reported hearing what is believed to be Harpo Marx playing the harp and seeing an apparition of Sergei Rachmaninoff.\n\nGallery of historic images\nSee also\nDorchester Collection\nHotel Bel-Air\nVan Noy Railway News and Hotel Company\n\nReferences\nSources\nEdwards, Nick; Hodgkins, Charles; Keeling, Stephen (1 May 2014).

His career in Hollywood spanned five decades, and he is regarded as one of the most brilliant and versatile filmmakers of Classic Hollywood cinema. He received seven Academy Awards (among 21 nominations), a BAFTA Award, the Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or and two Golden Globe Awards.\nWilder became a screenwriter while living in Berlin. The rise of the Nazi Party and antisemitism in Germany saw him move to Paris. He then moved to Hollywood in 1934, and had a major hit when he, Charles Brackett and Walter Reisch wrote the screenplay for the Academy Award-nominated film Ninotchka (1939). Wilder established his directorial reputation and received his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director with the film noir Double Indemnity (1944), based on the novel by James M Cain with a screenplay by Wilder and Raymond Chandler. Wilder won the Best Director and Best Screenplay Academy Awards for The Lost Weekend (1945), which also won the Academy Award for Best Picture.\nIn the 1950s, Wilder directed and co-wrote a string of critically acclaimed films, including the Hollywood drama Sunset Boulevard (1950), for which he won his second screenplay Academy Award; Ace in the Hole (1951), Stalag 17 (1953) and Sabrina (1954). Wilder directed and co-wrote three films in 1957: The Spirit of St. Louis, Love in the Afternoon and Witness for the Prosecution. During this period, Wilder also directed Marilyn Monroe in two films, The Seven Year Itch (1955) and Some Like It Hot (1959). In 1960, Wilder co-wrote, directed and produced the critically acclaimed film The Apartment. It won Wilder Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay.\nOther notable films Wilder directed include One, Two, Three (1961), Irma la Douce (1963), Kiss Me, Stupid (1964), The Fortune Cookie (1966) and Avanti! (1972).\nWilder received various honors for his distinguished career including the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1986, the Kennedy Center Honors in 1990, the National Medal of Arts in 1993 and the BAFTA Fellowship Award in 1995. He also received the Directors Guild of America's Lifetime Achievement Award, the Laurel Award for Screenwriting Achievement and the Producers Guild of America's Lifetime Achievement Award. Seven of his films are preserved in the United States National Film Registry of the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\".\n\nEarly life\nSamuel Wilder (Yiddish: \u05e9\u05de\u05d5\u05d0\u05dc \u05f0\u05d9\u05dc\u05d3\u05e2\u05e8 Shmuel Vilder) was born on June 22, 1906, to a family of Polish Jews in Sucha, a small town in Galicia, Poland, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Years later in Hollywood, he would describe it as being \"Half an hour from Vienna. By telegraph.\" His parents were Eugenia (n\u00e9e Dittler) and Max Wilder. His mother described him as a \"rambunctious kid\"; inspired by Buffalo Bill's Wild West Shows, which she saw while living briefly in New York, she nicknamed him \"Billie\", which he changed to \"Billy\" upon moving to America.\nWilder's elder brother, W. Lee Wilder, was also a filmmaker. His parents had a successful cake shop in Sucha's train station that flourished into a chain of railroad cafes. Eugenia and Max Wilder did not persuade their son to join the family business. Max moved to Krak\u00f3w to manage a hotel before moving to Vienna and dying when Billy was 22 years old. After the family moved to Vienna, Wilder became a journalist instead of attending the University of Vienna. In 1926, jazz band leader Paul Whiteman was on tour in Vienna where he was interviewed by Wilder. Whiteman liked young Wilder enough that he took him with the band to Berlin, where Wilder was able to make more connections in entertainment.\nBefore achieving success as a writer, he was a taxi dancer in Berlin.\n\nCareer\nEarly work\nAfter writing crime and sports stories as a stringer for local newspapers, he was eventually offered a regular job at a Berlin tabloid. Developing an interest in film, he began working as a screenwriter. From 1929 to 1933 he produced twelve German films. He collaborated with several other novices (Fred Zinnemann and Robert Siodmak) on the 1930 film People on Sunday. Eschewing the German Expressionist styles of F. W. Murnau and Fritz Lang, People on Sunday was considered as a groundbreaking example of the Neue Sachlichkeit or New Objectivity movement in German cinema. Furthermore, this genre of Strassenfilm (\"street film\") paved way to the birth of Italian neorealism and the French New Wave. He wrote the screenplay for the 1931 film adaptation of a novel by Erich K\u00e4stner, Emil and the Detectives, also screenplays for the comedy The Man in Search of His Murderer (1931), the operetta Her Grace Commands (1931) and the comedy A Blonde Dream (1932), all of them produced in the Babelsberg Studios in Potsdam near Berlin. In 1932 Wilder collaborated with the writer and journalist Felix Salten on the screenplay for \"Scampolo\". After Adolf Hitler's rise to power, Wilder went to Paris, where he made his directorial debut film Mauvaise Graine (1934). He relocated to Hollywood prior to its release. Wilder's mother, grandmother and stepfather were all victims of the Holocaust. For decades it was assumed that it happened at Auschwitz Concentration Camp, but while researching Polish and Israeli archives, his Austrian biographer Andreas Hutter discovered in 2011 that they were murdered in different locations: his mother, Eugenia \"Gitla\" Siedlisker, in 1943 at Plaszow; his stepfather, Bernard \"Berl\" Siedlisker, in 1942 at Belzec; and his grandmother, Balbina Baldinger, died in 1943 in the ghetto in Nowy Targ.\nAfter arriving in Hollywood in 1934, Wilder continued working as a screenwriter. He became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1939, having spent time in Mexico waiting for the government after his six-month card expired in 1934, an episode reflected in his 1941 Hold Back the Dawn. Wilder's first significant success was Ninotchka, a collaboration with fellow German immigrant Ernst Lubitsch. The romantic comedy starred Greta Garbo (generally known as a tragic heroine in film melodramas), and was popularly and critically acclaimed. With the byline \"Garbo Laughs!\", it also took Garbo's career in a new direction. The film marked Wilder's first Academy Award nomination, which he shared with co-writer Charles Brackett (although their collaboration on Bluebeard's Eighth Wife and Midnight had been well received). Wilder co-wrote many of his films with Brackett from 1938 to 1950. Brackett described their collaboration process: \"The thing to do was suggest an idea, have it torn apart and despised. In a few days it would be apt to turn up, slightly changed, as Wilder's idea. Once I got adjusted to that way of working, our lives were simpler.\" \"Wilder followed Ninotchka with a series of box office hits in 1942, including Hold Back the Dawn, Ball of Fire, and his directorial debut film The Major and the Minor.\n\n1940s\nHis third film as director, the film noir Double Indemnity, starring Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson, was a major hit. It was nominated for seven Academy Awards including Best Picture, Director, Screenplay and Actress; Wilder co-wrote it with Raymond Chandler. The film not only set conventions for the noir genre (such as \"venetian blind\" lighting and voice-over narration), but is a landmark in the battle against Hollywood censorship. Based on James M. Cain's novel, it featured two love triangles and a murder plotted for insurance money. While the book was popular with the reading public, it had been considered unfilmable under the Hays Code because adultery was central to the plot.\nIn 1945, the Psychological Warfare Department of the United States Department of War produced an American documentary film directed by Wilder. The film known as Death Mills, or Die Todesm\u00fchlen, was intended for German audiences to educate them about the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime. For the German version, Die Todesm\u00fchlen, Hanu\u0161 Burger is credited as the writer and director, while Wilder supervised the editing. Wilder is credited with the English-language version.\nTwo years later, Wilder adapted from Charles R. Jackson's novel The Lost Weekend into a film of the same name. It was the first major American film with a serious examination of alcoholism, another difficult theme under the Production Code. It follows an alcoholic writer (Ray Milland) opposing the protestations of his girlfriend (Jane Wyman). The film earned critical acclaim after it premiered at the Cannes Film Festival and competed in the main competition, where it received the Festival's top prize, the Palme d'Or, and four Academy Awards including for Best Picture. Wilder earned the Oscars for Best Director and Best Screenplay and Milland won Best Actor. The film remained to be one of the three films, winning both the Academy Award for Best Picture and the Cannes Film Festival's Palme d' Or, alongside Marty and Parasite.\n\n1950s\nIn 1950, Wilder co-wrote and directed the cynical noir comedy film Sunset Boulevard. It follows a reclusive silent film actress (Gloria Swanson), who dreams of a comeback with delusions of her greatness from a bygone era. She accompanies an aspiring screenwriter (William Holden), who becomes her gigolo partner. This critically acclaimed film was the final film Wilder collaborated with Brackett. The film was nominated for eleven Academy Awards; together Wilder and Brackett won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.\nIn 1951, Wilder directed Ace in the Hole (a.k.a. The Big Carnival) starring Kirk Douglas in a tale of media exploitation of a caving accident. The idea had been pitched over the phone to Wilder's secretary by Victor Desny. Desny sued Wilder for breach of an implied contract in the California copyright case Wilder v Desny, ultimately receiving a settlement of $14,350. Although a critical and commercial failure at the time, its reputation has grown over the years. The following year, Wilder announced plans to direct and produce a film version of the Sophocles tragedy Oedipus Rex, adapted for the screen by Walter Reisch. They planned to shoot the film on location in Greece in Technicolor, but it never went into production.\nSubsequently, Wilder directed three adaptations of Broadway plays, war drama Stalag 17, for which William Holden won the Best Actor Academy Award, romantic comedy Sabrina, for which Audrey Hepburn was nominated for Best Actress, and romantic comedy The Seven Year Itch, which features the iconic image of Marilyn Monroe standing on a subway grate as her white dress is blown upwards by a passing train. Wilder was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director for the first two films and shared a nomination for Best Screenplay for the second. He was interested in doing a film with one of the classic slapstick comedy acts of the Hollywood Golden Age. He first considered, and rejected, a project to star Laurel and Hardy. He held discussions with Groucho Marx concerning a new Marx Brothers comedy, tentatively titled A Day at the U.N. The project was abandoned after Chico Marx died in 1961.\nIn 1957, three films Wilder directed were released: biopic The Spirit of St. Louis, starring James Stewart as Charles Lindbergh, romantic comedy Love In The Afternoon\u2014Wilder's first screenplay with I. A. L. Diamond, who would become his regular partner\u2014featuring Gary Cooper, Maurice Chevalier and Audrey Hepburn, and courtroom drama Witness for the Prosecution, featuring Tyrone Power, Marlene Dietrich and Charles Laughton. Wilder received an Academy Award nomination for Best Director for the last film.\n\nIn 1959, Wilder reunited with Monroe in the United Artists released Prohibition-era farce film Some Like It Hot. It was released, however, without a Production Code seal of approval, which was withheld due to the film's unabashed sexual comedy, including a central cross-dressing theme. Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis played musicians disguised as women to escape pursuit by a Chicago gang. Curtis's character courts a singer (Monroe), while Lemmon is wooed by Joe E. Brown \u2013 setting up the film's final joke in which Lemmon reveals that his character is a man and Brown blandly replies \"Well, nobody's perfect\". A box office success, the film was lightly regarded by film critics during its original release, although it did receive six Academy Award nominations, including for Best Director and Best Screenplay. But its critical reputation grew prodigiously; in 2000, the American Film Institute selected it as the best American comedy ever made. In 2012, the British Film Institute decennial Sight and Sound poll of the world's film critics rated it as the 43rd best movie ever made, and the second-highest-ranking comedy.\n\n1960s\nIn 1960, Wilder directed the comedy romance film The Apartment. It follows an insurance clerk (Lemmon), who allows his coworkers to use his apartment to conduct extramarital affairs until he meets an elevator woman (Shirley MacLaine). The film was a critical success with The New York Times film critic Bosley Crowther, who called the film \"gleeful, tender, and even sentimental\" and Wilder's direction \"ingenious\". The film received ten Academy Awards nominations and won five awards, including three for Wilder: Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay.\nWilder directed the Cold War political farce film One, Two, Three (1961), starring James Cagney, which won critical praise with Variety writing, \"Billy Wilder's One, Two, Three is a fast-paced, high-pitched, hard-hitting, lighthearted farce crammed with topical gags and spiced with satirical overtones. Story is so furiously quick-witted that some of its wit gets snarled and smothered in overlap.\" It was followed by the romantic comedy Irma la Douce (1963) starring Lemmon and MacLaine. The film was the fifth highest-grossing film of the year. Wilder received a Writers Guild of America Award nomination for his screenplay. Wilder then wrote and directed the sex comedy film Kiss Me, Stupid starring Dean Martin, Kim Novak, and Ray Walston, who was a last minute replacement for ailing Peter Sellers. The film was criticized by some critics for vulgarity, with Bosley Crowther blaming the film for giving American movies the reputation of \"deliberate and degenerate corruptors of public taste and morals\". A. H. Weiler of the New York Times called the film \"pitifully unfunny\". Wilder gained his final Academy Award nomination and a Writers Guild of America Award nomination for the screenplay of The Fortune Cookie. It was the first film pairing Jack Lemmon with Walter Matthau. (The film was titled Meet Whiplash Willie in the United Kingdom.) In 1970, he directed The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes, which was intended as a major roadshow theatrical release, but to Wilder's dismay was heavily cut by the studio.\n\nFinal films\nHe directed the comedy film Avanti!, which follows a businessman (Lemmon) attempting to retrieve the body of his deceased father from Italy. Wilder received two Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Director and Best Screenplay, and a Writers Guild of America Award nomination. Wilder directed The Front Page based on the Broadway play of the same name. It was a significant financial success with low budget. His final films, Fedora and Buddy Buddy, failed to impress critics or the public, although Fedora has since been re-evaluated and is now considered favorably. Wilder had hoped to make Thomas Keneally's Schindler's Ark as his final film, saying \"I wanted to do it as a kind of memorial to my mother and my grandmother and my stepfather,\" who had all been murdered in the Holocaust. He praised Steven Spielberg's adaptation, Schindler's List. To those who denied the Holocaust, Wilder wrote in a German newspaper, \"If the concentration camps and the gas chambers were all imaginary, then please tell me\u2014where is my mother?\"\n\nDirectorial style\nWilder's directorial choices reflected his belief in the primacy of writing. He avoided, especially in the second half of his career, the exuberant cinematography of Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Welles because, in Wilder's opinion, shots that called attention to themselves would distract the audience from the story. Wilder's films have tight plotting and memorable dialogue. Despite his conservative directorial style, his subject matter often pushed the boundaries of mainstream entertainment. Once a subject was chosen, he would begin to visualize in terms of specific artists. His belief was that no matter how talented the actor, none were without limitations and the result would be better if you bent the script to their personality rather than force a performance beyond their limitations. Wilder was skilled at working with actors, coaxing silent era legends Gloria Swanson and Erich von Stroheim out of retirement for roles in Sunset Boulevard. Regarding Wilder's more comedic films, Roger Ebert wrote: \"he took the characters seriously, or at least as seriously as the material allowed, and got a lot of the laughs by playing scenes straight.\"\nFor Stalag 17, Wilder squeezed an Oscar-winning performance out of a reluctant William Holden (Holden had wanted to make his character more likable; Wilder refused). At a casting meeting, Wilder reportedly said, \"I'm tired of clich\u00e9d typecasting\u2014the same people in every film.\" An example of this is Wilder's casting of Fred MacMurray in Double Indemnity and The Apartment. MacMurray had become Hollywood's highest-paid actor portraying a decent, thoughtful character in light comedies, melodramas, and musicals; Wilder cast him as a womanizing schemer. Humphrey Bogart shed his tough-guy image to give one of his warmest performances in Sabrina. James Cagney, not usually known for comedy, was memorable in a high-octane comic role for Wilder's One, Two, Three. Wilder coaxed a very effective performance out of Monroe in Some Like It Hot.\nIn total, he directed fourteen different actors in Oscar-nominated performances: Barbara Stanwyck in Double Indemnity, Ray Milland in The Lost Weekend, William Holden in Sunset Boulevard and Stalag 17, Gloria Swanson, Erich von Stroheim and Nancy Olson in Sunset Boulevard, Robert Strauss in Stalag 17, Audrey Hepburn in Sabrina, Charles Laughton in Witness for the Prosecution, Elsa Lanchester in Witness for the Prosecution, Jack Lemmon in Some Like It Hot and The Apartment, Jack Kruschen in The Apartment, Shirley MacLaine in The Apartment and Irma la Douce and Walter Matthau in The Fortune Cookie. Wilder mentioned Lemmon, and was the first director to pair him and Matthau in The Fortune Cookie. Wilder and Lemmon worked on seven films. \nWilder opposed the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). He co-created the \"Committee for the First Amendment\", of 500 Hollywood personalities and stars to \"support those professionals called upon to testify before the HUAC who had classified themselves as hostile with regard to the interrogations and the interrogators\". Some anti-Communists wanted those in the cinema industry to take oaths of allegiance. The Screen Directors Guild had a vote by show of hands. Only John Huston and Wilder opposed. Huston said, \"I am sure it was one of the bravest things that Billy, as a naturalized German, had ever done. There were 150 to 200 directors at this meeting, and here Billy and I sat alone with our hands raised in protest against the loyalty oath.\"\nWilder was not affected by the Hollywood blacklist. Of the blacklisted 'Hollywood Ten' he said, \"Of the ten, two had talent, and the rest were just unfriendly.\" In general, Wilder disliked formula and genre films. Wilder reveled in poking fun at those who took politics too seriously. In Ball of Fire, his burlesque queen 'Sugarpuss' points at her sore throat and complains \"Pink? It's as red as the Daily Worker and just as sore.\" Later, she gives the overbearing and unsmiling housemaid the name \"Franco\".\n\nRetirement\nWilder received the American Film Institute Life Achievement Award in 1986. He received the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award in 1988, the Kennedy Center Honors in 1990 and the National Medal of Arts in 1993. He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Wilder became well known for owning one of the finest and most extensive art collections in Hollywood, mainly collecting modern art. As he described it in the mid-80s, \"It's a sickness. I don't know how to stop myself. Call it bulimia if you want \u2013 or curiosity or passion. I have some Impressionists, some Picassos from every period, some mobiles by Calder. I also collect tiny Japanese trees, glass paperweights, and Chinese vases. Name an object and I collect it.\" Wilder's artistic ambitions led him to create a series of works of his own. By the early '90s, Wilder had amassed many plastic-artistic constructions, many of which were made in collaboration with artist Bruce Houston. In 1993, art dealer Louis Stern, a longtime friend, helped organize an exhibition of Wilder's work at his Beverly Hills gallery. The exhibition was titled Billy Wilder's March\u00e9 aux Puces and the Variations on the Theme of Queen Nefertete segment was notably popular. This series featured busts of the Egyptian queen wrapped \u00e0 la Christo, or splattered \u00e0 la Jackson Pollock, or sporting a Campbell's soup can in homage to Andy Warhol.\n\nPersonal life and death\nWilder married Judith Coppicus on December 22, 1936. The couple had twins, Victoria and Vincent (born 1939), but Vincent died shortly after birth. They divorced in 1946. Wilder met Audrey Young while filming The Lost Weekend. They were married on June 30, 1949.\nWilder died of pneumonia on March 27, 2002. He was buried at Pierce Brothers Westwood Village Memorial Park and Mortuary. A French newspaper, Le Monde, titled the front-page obituary: \"Billy Wilder is dead. Nobody is perfect\", a reference to the last line of Some Like It Hot.\n\nLegacy\n\"Don't be boring\". \u2014 Billy Wilder\nWilder holds a significant place in the history of Hollywood censorship for expanding the range of acceptable subject matter. He directed two of film noir's definitive films, Double Indemnity and Sunset Boulevard. Along with Woody Allen and the Marx Brothers, he leads the list of films on the American Film Institute's AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs and he earned the top spot on it with Some Like It Hot. Also on the list are The Apartment and The Seven Year Itch, which he directed, and Ball of Fire and Ninotchka, which he co-wrote. The AFI listed Double Indemnity, Sunset Boulevard, Some Like It Hot and The Apartment on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies. Wilder was ranked 6th in director's poll on Sight & Sound's 2002 list of The Greatest Directors of All Time. In 1996, Entertainment Weekly ranked Wilder at No. 24 in its \"50 Greatest Directors\" list. Wilder was ranked at No. 19 on Empire's \"Top 40 Greatest Directors of All-Time\" list in 2005. In 2007, Total Film magazine ranked Wilder at No. 13 on its \"100 Greatest Film Directors Ever\" list. Wilder was voted at No. 4 on the \"Greatest Directors of 20th Century\" poll conducted by Japanese film magazine Kinema Junpo.\nSeven of his films are preserved in the United States National Film Registry of the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\". Anthony Lane writes that Double Indemnity, The Seven Year Itch, Sunset Boulevard and The Apartment are \"part of the lexicon of moviegoing\" and that Some Like It Hot is a \"national treasure.\" Roger Ebert asked, \"Of all the great directors of Hollywood's golden age, has anybody made more films that are as fresh and entertaining to this day as Billy Wilder's?...And who else can field three contenders among the greatest closing lines of all time?\", citing the closing lines of Sunset Boulevard, Some Like it Hot, and The Apartment. Ron Shelton recalls encountering Wilder:\n\n I was in a restaurant about six months after Bull Durham came out. And a man came over and said \"Somebody would like to see you.\" And I looked over and it was Billy Wilder. And I went over and he said, \"Great fuckin' picture, kid!\"And I thought that was a good a review as you could have.\"\nWhen Belle \u00c9poque won the 1993 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, Spanish filmmaker Fernando Trueba said in his acceptance speech: \"I would like to believe in God in order to thank him. But I just believe in Billy Wilder... so thank you, Mr. Wilder.\" According to Trueba, Wilder called him the day after and told him: \"Fernando, it's God.\" French filmmaker Michel Hazanavicius thanked Billy Wilder in the 2012 Best Picture Oscar acceptance speech for The Artist: \"I would like to thank the following three people, I would like to thank Billy Wilder, I would like to thank Billy Wilder, and I would like to thank Billy Wilder.\" Wilder's 12 Academy Award nominations for screenwriting were a record until 1997 when Woody Allen received a 13th nomination for Deconstructing Harry. In 2017, Vulture.com named Wilder the greatest screenwriter of all time. He directed fourteen actors in Oscar-nominated performances. Wilder's epitaph, a paraphrase of the last line of Some Like It Hot, is \"I'm a writer but then nobody's perfect.\"\n\nFilmography\nAwards and honors\nWilder received twenty-one nominations at the Academy Awards, winning six. In total, he received twelve nominations for his screenwriting, eight for his direction, and one for producing. He won both the Academy Award for Best Director and the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for both The Lost Weekend (1945) and The Apartment (1960). The former was awarded the Grand Prix du Festival International du Film at the Cannes Film Festival, and the latter also won him the BAFTA Award for Best Film. Wilder garnered eight Directors Guild of America Award nominations, with the sole win for his work on The Apartment. He received seven nominations at the Golden Globe Awards, winning Best Director for The Lost Weekend and Sunset Boulevard (1950). He won seven Writers Guild of America Awards including two Laurel Awards for Screenwriting Achievement. He garnered a number of lifetime achievement awards including the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award, the BAFTA Fellowship, the David O. Selznick Achievement Award in Theatrical Motion Pictures, and the Honorary Golden Bear from the Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nSee also\nList of film director and actor collaborations\nList of refugees\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links\n\nBilly Wilder at IMDb\nBilly Wilder at the Internet Broadway Database \nBilly Wilder at the TCM Movie Database \nBilly Wilder at American Masters\nBilly Wilder at \u00d6sterreichische Mediathek archive (in German)\nBilly Wilder at Encyclopedia Britannica\nBilly Wilder at AllMovie, All Media Network\nBilly Wilder, at AFI Catalog of Feature Films, American Film Institute\nBilly Wilder, su TV.com, Red Ventures (archived the 1\u00ba January 2012)","28":"Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church (officially: The Church of the Blessed Sacrament) is a parish in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles located on Sunset Boulevard in the heart of Hollywood, California.  The church today serves an urban, multiethnic community and is known for, among other things, its gay and lesbian ministry and its many outreach programs, including programs to assist the poor.  Founded in 1904, the parish was the home parish for many actors during the classic Hollywood era of the 1920s through the 1950s, including Bing Crosby, John Ford, Irene Dunne, Loretta Young, Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n and Ann Blyth.  The Italian Renaissance church, built in 1928 but not completed until 1954, received a historic preservation grant in 2000 from the J. Paul Getty Trust.\n\nHistory\nEarly years\nBlessed Sacrament Church was formed in 1904, and the first church, which accommodated 250 people, was built on Hollywood Boulevard (then called Prospect Ave).  As the movie business developed in the 1910s, the population of Hollywood increased dramatically.  By 1919, the old church was \"literally bursting at the seams every Sunday.\" Enrollment at the parish school also jumped from 17 students in 1915 to 140 in 1919.\n\nMove to Sunset Boulevard\nIn 1921, the parish paid $75,000 for the land on Sunset Boulevard that is the current home of the church.  Benefiting from a Hollywood real estate boom, the church later sold its existing property on Hollywood Boulevard for $300,000.\nThe new church and school on Sunset Boulevard were designed by Thomas Franklin Power.  Power designed the Blessed Sacrament School, which opened in 1923, in an Italian Renaissance style.  When the new school opened, its enrollment was 370 students.  Power next turned his attention to the new church, which he adapted from the Basilican style of the Italian Renaissance style.  The roof, however, was made of tile instead of the flat roof typical of Roman churches.  Power designed the interior with flanking arches to be reminiscent of the San Paolo and St. Clement Basilicas in Rome.  The new church was dedicated in June 1928.  With its 223-foot chimes tower, ornate exterior and seating for 1,400 people, Blessed Sacrament quickly became a Hollywood landmark.\n\nCompletion of the church interior\nThough the structure was completed in 1928, completion of the interior decoration and ornamentation was delayed when the Great Depression began in 1929.  One interior element that did move forward during the Depression was the Stations of the Cross.  Noted Italian artist, Carlo Wostry, had been hired to paint murals at St. Andrew's Catholic Church in Pasadena, and was also hired to paint the Stations of the Cross at Blessed Sacrament.  Wostry began working on the Stations in Italy in 1930 and finished them in 1932.  It was not until 1951 that architect, J. Earl Trudeau, was hired to complete the interior design.  Trudeau said he \"chose a rather simpler treatment, featuring economy of means both in the artistic and economic senses.\"  The interior work was finally completed in early 1954.\n\nFather McCoy: pastor from 1932 to 1957\nThe parish's longest-serving pastor was Father Cornelius McCoy, who was pastor for 25 years from 1932 to. 1957.  He took over the parish in the middle of the Great Depression and oversaw the completion of the church.  When he stepped down as pastor in 1957, the parish had 6,000 members. \nDuring Father McCoy's tenure the new archbishop, James Francis Cardinal McIntyre, offered to purchase the church from the Jesuit order. Cardinal McIntyre wanted to replace St Vibiana's cathedral in downtown Los Angeles with an existing church more centrally located in the sprawling archdiocese to serve as the new cathedral. The order refused to sell the property to the Archdiocese of Los Angeles and the matter of finding a new cathedral remained unsettled.\nIn 1955, organist Richard Key Biggs received the Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice decoration in recognition of 27 years service.\n\nFather Falvey priest abuse scandal\nFather Mark Falvey who was an assistant pastor at Blessed Sacrament from 1959 until his death in 1975 was accused of sexually molesting four girls and five boys between 1959 and 1975 at Blessed Sacrament. Falvey was never charged with a crime. In May 2007, The Jesuit order agreed to pay $16 million to settle these claims. A Jesuit representative said he agreed with the plaintiffs' lawyer that \"Father Falvey was not handled correctly by the Jesuit order\", and that he \"should have been removed from ministry\" after the first victim. Since then the church has instituted the VIRTUS program to prevent such a tragedy in the future.\n\nEconomic decline and violence\nIn recent decades, the Hollywood area has experienced an economic decline, with large numbers of homeless and poor people living in the area.  A low point for the parish came in October 1987, when a gunman opened fire into a crowd of hundreds attending the church's carnival, spraying the area with bullets.  Two adults and two children (a 15-year-old and a 9-year-old) were wounded in gunfire.\n\nRepentant lingerie looter\nIn 1992, the church drew national media attention after a repentant man who had looted the \"Frederick's of Hollywood\" lingerie museum during the Los Angeles riots delivered a bag of pilfered celebrity lingerie, including Ava Gardner's \"bloomers\" and a push-up bra once worn by TV actress Katey Sagal, to the church's pastor, Father Bob Fambrini.   An Austin newspaper noted that Father Fambrini \"may be the only priest in America to ever comfort a man who felt guilty about stealing celebrity bloomers.\"  The St. Louis Post-Dispatch noted that such an \"uplifting story could only happen in Hollywood.\"\n\nSocial Services at Blessed Sacrament\nBy the 1980s, what had once been a large convent housing the sisters of the Order of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, had become part of a sanctuary effort to protect undocumented individuals from Central America fleeing the violence in the region. They were assisted by members of the Jesuit order. In late April 1999, Sr. Peg Dolan of Loyola Marymount University headed a group of \"Alumni for Others\" in the restoration of the former convent on Selma Avenue in Hollywood. Alumni from Jesuit Universities at LMU, University of San Francisco and Santa Clara University helped transform the vacated building into a fully functional Social Service Center, which opened its doors just one month later. With the majority of furniture and fixtures donated by parishioners and Hollywood residents, the center began on its path of offering quality services almost entirely by donation of goods, funds, and time.\n\nGetty preservation grant\nIn July 2000, Blessed Sacrament was one of 20 Los Angeles landmarks to receive a \"Preserve L.A.\" grant from the J. Paul Getty Trust for the preservation of historic buildings and sites throughout Los Angeles County.\n\n100th anniversary\nIn 2004, Cardinal Roger Mahony presided at the parish's 100th anniversary Mass, which was celebrated in three languages (English, Spanish and Tagalog).  Cardinal Mahony noted the parish's long tradition of outreach to the Hollywood community, especially the poor and homeless.  He praised those efforts: \"I am proud of you because you have done this well. It helps us identify with what Jesus is calling us to in today's Gospel.\"  Cardinal Mahony also thanked the Society of Jesus for their long history of service to the parish, and the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart, whose religious community staffed the school for many decades.\n\nThe Center at Blessed Sacrament\nIn 2006, the Social Services Center embarked on a renewed mission to continue assisting those in need. In order to raise awareness and maximize funding opportunities, the Center became an independent agency and obtained its separate federal and state tax-exempt status. While continuing to be an integral part of the Blessed Sacrament social services mission, the center is now governed by an independent Board of Directors composed of civic leaders, volunteers and local residents. The Center provides services to all who are in need without regard to religious affiliation. From 2015 until current day, The Center experienced significant growth under the leadership of executive director, Nathan Sheets. Currently, as of March 2021, The Center has more than 50 staff across eight programs, focusing on community engagement, outreach, housing services, food distribution, and long-term housing retention.\n\nJesuits Depart\nIn January 2024, Jesuit Provincial Sean Carroll S.J. announced that after 100 years, the Jesuits would be departing Blessed Sacrament.\n\nConnections with the movie business\nEarly ties to Hollywood\nLocated in the heart of Hollywood, Blessed Sacrament has had close ties to the movie industry in its early years.  As early as June 1916, the \"popular stars of filmdom\" were giving their time and talents gratis for a three-act burlesque on the \"old-time melodrama\" and novel specialty numbers.\nWhen the parish needed funds to build a new church in the 1920s, the movie industry, which often used the church as a shooting location, again offered its help. The movie studios including Universal and  Keystone helped the parish raise funds for the new church, providing actors and equipment for the church's fundraising events.  In October 1926, the Los Angeles Times reported that Blessed Sacrament was holding the \"biggest bazaar ever held in cinema town, with the co-operation of practically the entire motion-picture industry\" to raise funds for the new church.  The Times noted that the bazaar was housed under a canvas top, \"with gaily decorated booths, gorgeous articles donated by the motion-picture stars, and by wealth persons engaged in other industries.\"\nThe parish's history reports that the church was so central to the early movie business that the first professional organization for Hollywood's screenwriters and actors (precursor to the Writers and Screen Actors Guilds) was formed at the church.\nBlessed Sacrament was also the site of \"the annual parade of Catholic movie stars\" (including Loretta Young, Irene Dunne, and Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n) into church for the city's archbishop, James Francis Cardinal McIntyre's annual Communion breakfast for the entertainment industry. It was held during Lent so the industry's Catholics could also make their Easter duty.\n\nCelebrity weddings and funerals\nWith its location in the heart of Hollywood, Blessed Sacrament was for years the home parish to many noted actors.  It was also the site of many celebrity funerals and weddings, including the following:\n\nIn September 1930, Bing Crosby was married to his first wife, 18-year-old Dixie Lee, at Blessed Sacrament Church.\nIn September 1934, the funeral for singer Russ Columbo (who was accidentally shot by a vintage gun assumed to be unloaded) was held at Blessed Sacrament, with Bing Crosby, Gilbert Roland and Zeppo Marx serving as pallbearers.\nIn 1941, German writer Alfred D\u00f6blin, who was from a Jewish background but had not previously been religious, was baptized at Blessed Sacrament.\n\nIn 1956, John Wayne's daughter, Toni, was married at Blessed Sacrament in a ceremony presided over by Cardinal McIntyre. More than 500 guests, including Bob Hope, Ann Blyth, and Loretta Young attended.\nJohn Wayne's other daughter, Melinda Ann, was also married at Blessed Sacrament in a ceremony attended by Cesar Romero, Jeanne Crain, Irene Dunne, and Loretta Young. During the ceremony, Melinda started teetering at her kneeling bench, and the Duke saw his daughter in trouble and dashed from his pew to her side, catching her just as she began to fall from a fainting spell.  A priest brought a chair and she sat throughout the rest of the Mass.\nIn October 1959, the funeral of actor-singer, Mario Lanza, was held at Blessed Sacrament.  Some 1,500 people attended the funeral including Kathryn Grayson and Zsa Zsa Gabor.\nIn November 1960, the funeral for Mack Sennett, innovator in slapstick comedy and known as the \"King of Comedy\" during his lifetime, was held at Blessed Sacrament.\nIn June 1962, actor Brian Kelly (the father on the 1960s TV series \"Flipper\") was married to actress Laura Devon at Blessed Sacrament.\nFather Donald Merrifield, the first president of Loyola Marymount University, was ordained a Roman Catholic Jesuit priest at Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church in 1965.\nIn October 1972, the funeral for actor, Leo G. Carroll, featured in many movies of the 1930s\u20131950s, including several directed by Alfred Hitchcock, star of the \"Topper\" series, and memorable as Mr Waverly in \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\" TV spy series, was held at Blessed Sacrament.\nIn November 1972, the funeral for Rudolf Friml, composer of music for operettas such as Rose Marie and The Vagabond King was held there.\nIn September 1973, the funeral for John Ford, Hollywood's most honored film director, was held at Blessed Sacrament. Ford's funeral was conducted by Timothy Cardinal Manning and attended by many of Hollywood's most famous personalities, including John Wayne, James Stewart, Charlton Heston, Henry Fonda, Frank Capra, William Wyler, Pat O'Brien, Loretta Young and Cesar Romero.  Ford's biographer noted that the bronze doors to the church were donated by Ford.\nIn August 1986, the funeral for actor Lorenzo Tucker, known as the \"Black Valentino\" in the 1920s and 1930s, was held at Blessed Sacrament.\n\nShooting location\nBlessed Sacrament has also been used as a shooting location for movies and television, including:\n\nA battle with \"G-Man\" in the 1957 film Teenage Monster, was shot on the steps of Blessed Sacrament Church.\nA scene in the 1997 film L.A. Confidential.\nA 2001 episode of ER, in which James Cromwell plays a bishop presiding at an ordination ceremony. The church's  director of social services, Brother Jim Siwicki, along with novice Brother Julio Lingad (who died due to a heart related medical issue in July 2001, seven months after the episode aired and one month before taking his simple vows), appeared in the scene as transitional deacons, while the Blessed Sacrament choir and other parishioners served as extras.\nIn 2017, Lil Pump filmed a music video, for his song \"Gucci Gang\", at the Blessed Sacrament School, located adjacent to the church; the exterior of the church is included in scenes set in the parking lot of the school. However, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles stated that the school's administration had not followed the procedures required to get its approval for filming the video, which featured the recreational drugs lean and cannabis, has lyrics discussing cocaine use, and includes explicit language describing acts of pre-marital sex.\n\nPriests and parish life directors\nSince its formation in 1904, Blessed Sacrament has had 24 pastors and parish life directors (PLD). From 1914 to 2024, the pastors have been members of the Society of Jesus. In 2011, Blessed Sacrament installed its first parish life director.  The pastors and PLD who have served Blessed Sacrament are:\n\nSee also\nOur Lady of the Angels Pastoral Region\n\nNotes\nExternal links\n\nBlessed Sacrament Parish History\nBlessed Sacrament official web site\n\"Seeing Stars\" web page on Blessed Sacrament","29":"Beverly Hills is a city located in Los Angeles County, California, United States. A notable and historic suburb of Los Angeles, it is located just southwest of the Hollywood Hills, approximately 12.2 miles (19.6 km) northwest of downtown Los Angeles. Beverly Hills' land area totals 5.71 square miles (14.8 km2) and (together with the neighboring smaller city of West Hollywood to the east) is entirely surrounded by the city of Los Angeles. According to the 2020 census, the city has a population of 32,701, marking a decrease of 1,408 from the 2010 census count of 34,109.\nIn American popular culture, Beverly Hills has been known primarily as an affluent location within Greater Los Angeles, which corresponds to higher property values and taxes in the area. The city is well known for its Rodeo Drive shopping district that includes many designer brands. Throughout its history, the city has been home to many celebrities. It is noted for numerous hotels and resorts, including the Beverly Hilton and the Beverly Hills Hotel. The city has been featured in many movies, television series, music, and media, in the United States and internationally.\nAfter its initial settlement in 1828, Beverly Hills was originally a primarily agricultural community centered around Rancho Rodeo de las Aguas, a Mexican era rancho grant. Beverly Hills was first incorporated as a city in September 1914 by a group of investors who had failed to find oil but found water instead and eventually decided to develop it into a town.\n\nHistory\nEarly history\nGaspar de Portol\u00e1 arrived in the area that would later become Beverly Hills on August 3, 1769, traveling along native trails which followed the present-day route of Wilshire Boulevard. The area was settled by Californio ranchera Mar\u00eda Rita Quinteros de Valdez and her husband in 1828. They called their 4,500 acres (18 km2) of property the Rancho Rodeo de las Aguas. In 1854, she sold the ranch to Benjamin Davis Wilson (1811\u20131878) and Henry Hancock (1822\u20131883). By the 1880s, the ranch had been subdivided into parcels of 75 acres (0.30 km2) and was being rapidly bought up by Anglos from Los Angeles and the East coast.\nHenry Hammel and Andrew H. Denker acquired most of it and used it for farming lima beans. At this point, the area was known as the Hammel and Denker Ranch. By 1888, they were planning to build a town called Morocco on their holdings.\n\n20th century\nIn 1900, Burton E. Green, Charles A. Canfield, Max Whittier, Frank H. Buck, Henry E. Huntington, William G. Kerckhoff, William F. Herrin, W.S. Porter, and Frank H. Balch formed the Amalgamated Oil Company, bought the Hammel and Denker ranch, and began looking for oil. They did not find enough to exploit commercially by the standards of the time, though. In 1906, therefore, they reorganized as the Rodeo Land and Water Company, renamed the property \"Beverly Hills\", subdivided it, and began selling lots. The development was named \"Beverly Hills\" after Beverly Farms in Beverly, Massachusetts, and because of the hills in the area.\nThe Los Angeles Times reported on September 2, 1906: \n\nPercy H. Clark Company are managing the development of the foothill portion of the Hammel & Denker ranch for the Rodeo Land and Water Company (the Canfield-Huntington-Kerckhoff syndicate), to be known as Beverly Hills. No expense is being spared to make this a fine suburban district. . . . The property has been laid out on beautiful curved lines.\n\nThe first house in the subdivision was built in 1907, but sales remained slow.\n\nRestrictive covenants\nBeverly Hills was one of many all-white planned communities started in the Los Angeles area around this time. Restrictive covenants prohibited non-whites from owning or renting property, unless they were employed as servants by white residents.:\u200a57\u200a It was also forbidden to sell or rent property to Jews in Beverly Hills.\n\nIncorporation\nBurton Green began construction on The Beverly Hills Hotel in 1911. The hotel was finished in 1912. The visitors drawn by the hotel were inclined to purchase land in Beverly Hills, and by 1914 the population had grown enough to qualify for incorporation as an independent city. That same year, the Rodeo Land and Water Company decided to separate its water business from its real estate business. The Beverly Hills Utility Commission was split off from the land company and incorporated in September 1914, buying all of the utilities-related assets from the Rodeo Land and Water Company.\n\nIn 1919, Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford bought land on Summit Drive and built a mansion, finished in 1921 and nicknamed \"Pickfair\" by the press. The glamour associated with Fairbanks and Pickford as well as other movie stars who built mansions in the city contributed to its growing appeal.\n\nWater supply\nBy the early 1920s, the population of Beverly Hills had grown enough to make the water supply a political issue. In 1923, the usual solution, annexation to the city of Los Angeles, was proposed.:\u200a65\u200a There was considerable opposition to annexation among such famous residents as Pickford, Fairbanks, Will Rogers and Rudolph Valentino. The Beverly Hills Utility Commission, opposed to annexation as well, managed to force the city into a special election and the plan was defeated 337 to 507.:\u200a65\u200a\n\nIn 1928, the Beverly Wilshire Apartment Hotel (now the Beverly Wilshire Hotel) opened on Wilshire Boulevard between El Camino and Rodeo drives, part of the old Beverly Hills Speedway. That same year, oilman Edward L. Doheny finished construction of Greystone Mansion, a 55-room mansion meant as a wedding present for his son Edward L. Doheny Jr. The house is now owned by the city of Beverly Hills and is a designated historical landmark.\nIn the early 1930s, Santa Monica Park was renamed Beverly Gardens and was extended to span the entire two-mile (3-kilometer) length of Santa Monica Boulevard through the city. The Electric Fountain marks the corner of Santa Monica Blvd. and Wilshire Blvd. with a small sculpture at the top of a Tongva kneeling in prayer. In April 1931, the new Italian Renaissance-style Beverly Hills City Hall was opened.:\u200a9\n\n1948 restrictive covenants found unenforceable\nIn the early 1940s, black actors and businessmen had begun to move into Beverly Hills, despite the covenants allowing only whites to live in the city. A neighborhood improvement association attempted to enforce the covenant in court. The defendants included prominent artists Hattie McDaniel, Louise Beavers, and Ethel Waters. Among the white residents supporting the lawsuit against blacks was Harold Lloyd, the silent film star. The NAACP participated in the defense, which was successful. In his decision, federal judge Thurmond Clarke said that it was time that \"members of the Negro race are accorded, without reservations or evasions, the full rights guaranteed to them under the 14th amendment.\" The United States Supreme Court declared restrictive covenants unenforceable in 1948 in Shelley v. Kraemer. A group of Jewish residents of Beverly Hills filed an amicus brief in this case.\nIn 1956, Paul Trousdale (1915\u20131990) purchased the grounds of the Doheny Ranch and developed it into the Trousdale Estates, convincing the city of Beverly Hills to annex it. The neighborhood has been home to Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Tony Curtis, Ray Charles, President Richard Nixon, as well as, in later years, Jennifer Aniston, David Spade, Vera Wang and John Rich.\n\nFollowing the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran, many Persian Jews settled in Beverly Hills.\nIn the late 1990s, the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA) proposed to build an extension of the Metro D Line along Wilshire Boulevard and into Downtown Beverly Hills, but the city had opposed it. The D Line Extension will ultimately be completed by 2027 and will include a station at Wilshire Blvd and Rodeo Drive.\n\n21st century\nIn 2001, LACMTA then proposed a bus rapid transit route down Santa Monica Blvd., but this was also opposed by the city and never built. This stretch of road is served by less efficient Metro Rapid buses using pre-existing roadways. By 2010, traffic in Beverly Hills and surrounding areas had deteriorated enough that the city's habitual opposition had largely turned to support for subways within the city limits. As part of the D Line Extension project, the D Line of the Los Angeles Metro Rail was intended in 2013 to be extended through Beverly Hills, adding two underground stations at Wilshire\/La Cienega and Wilshire\/Rodeo by the 2020s.\n\nThe city of Beverly Hills widely opposed Proposition 8, the 2008 ballot measure which repealed legal recognition of same-sex marriages. The proposition narrowly passed statewide, but in Beverly Hills, only 34% voted in favor, and 66% voted against it.\nIn the midst of the 2015 drought, Beverly Hills was found to be one of the largest water consumers in California. As a result, it was asked by the state to reduce consumption by 36%, prompting many residents to replace their lawns with native plants. Meanwhile, the city government replaced the grass in front of the City Hall with Mexican sage.\nIn September 2015, the City of Beverly Hills signed an agreement with Israel to work together on water use as well as \"cybersecurity, public health, emergency services, disaster preparedness, public safety, counterterrorism and art and culture\".\nIn July 2016, the City of Beverly Hills received the Livability Award from the United States Conference of Mayors for its Ambassador Program, which takes care of the city's homeless population.\nThe Beverly Hills Community Dog Park was dedicated on September 6, 2016.\n\nGeography\nBeverly Hills and the neighboring city of West Hollywood are together entirely surrounded by the city of Los Angeles. Beverly Hills is bordered on the northwest by the Los Angeles neighborhood of Bel-Air and the Santa Monica Mountains, on the east by West Hollywood, the Carthay neighborhood of Los Angeles, and the Fairfax District of Los Angeles, and on the south by the Beverlywood neighborhood of Los Angeles.

The store is \"known for its tall, teetering stacks and mazes of shelves crammed with titles that attracted entertainment and tourist industry clientele...\" Popular with many in the entertainment industry, the store continues to hosts events featuring a variety of celebrity authors who have so far included Muhammad Ali, Howard Stern, Annie Leibovitz, Chuck Palahniuk, Jenna Jameson, Hunter S. Thompson, Norman Mailer, and The Doors. Considered a \"cultural fixture\" of the Sunset Strip, Book Soup has also been featured as a location in a number of films and television shows.\n\nHistory\nThe store was founded in 1975 by Glenn Goldman  and David Mackler (both in graduate school at UCLA at the time) raised $50,000 and, after doing extensive research on where to locate their store, opened Book Soup on Sunset Boulevard. The rationale for the location, as Goldman explained, was that there \"had been a period of upheaval here in the '60s\u2014of thought and ideas\u2014and I felt that the people who lived in the neighborhood would and could really support a bookstore.\" Book Soup (the name was the least-offensive of those proposed by Goldman and Mackler) was nestled between a head shop and strip club. Mackler designed the store's interior.\nThe store and its staff of two (which included Goldman) struggled for two decades to run a profit. It nearly closed early in its existence, but a publisher's representative helped the store re-establish its credit line and saved the business. In 1985, Book Soup again nearly closed, but another publisher's representative loaned it the money to stay afloat. Book Soup added a storefront newsstand, \"News Mews,\" and began selling thousands of domestic and international periodicals and newspapers. In the late 1980s, Book Soup moved two blocks further down Sunset Boulevard to its current, more spacious location and expanded to 50,000 titles.  It also began earning a reputation for art, photography, film and music books as well as for hosting high-profile events featuring authors and celebrities such as Gore Vidal, James Ellroy, Mikal Gilmore, Edward Albee, Robert Wagner, and Tom Stoppard.\nA second Book Soup store at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, California, opened in 2002 but closed in 2007 due to high rent and the impact of competition from Amazon.com and large discount chain stores such as Wal-Mart and Target.\nAs of July 2017 there is a branch of Book Soup in the departure lounge of the Tom Bradley International Terminal at Los Angeles airport.\nGoldman announced he was selling Book Soup on January 2, 2009, then died of pancreatic cancer on January 3, 2009. Vroman's Bookstore and Book Soup signed an agreement October 9, 2009, to purchase Book Soup.\n\nPublicity stunts\nBook Soup hosts author readings on an almost daily basis. The store is well known for its many publicity stunts, some staged by authors and some staged by the store to attract customers. Among the more notable are:\n\nEmma Watson surprised guests joining friend and author Stephen Chbosky for his latest release, Imaginary Friend\nNicole Richie joined Sasha Sagan in conversation for Sasha's book, For Small Creatures Such as We\nFor a book reading by Paris Hilton, Hilton's publicist hired protesters to picket the store with signs stating \"Read a book, don't write one.\"\nAfter the United Kingdom banned Peter Wright's nonfiction expos\u00e9 Spy Catcher, Book Soup ran an ad in Private Eye magazine that stated \"Banned in Britain. Available in America.\" The store sold 3,000 copies of the book in the next three weeks.\nWhen a fatwa was issued condemning Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses, Goldman wrote a ransom note to the Los Angeles Times declaring that freedom of speech was being held hostage. Rupert Murdoch wrote Goldman a letter praising his \"ransom note.\"\nWhen the National Organization for Women (NOW) strongly criticized Bret Easton Ellis's 1991 novel American Psycho for glamorizing and condoning rape, Book Soup put fliers into its copies of the novel, blasting NOW for drawing attention to the book and disclaiming any approval of the novel's content. The store sold 18 copies of the book in 24 hours.\n\nIn popular culture\n\u2022 During her one-woman show, Letting Go of God, Julia Sweeney states that she bought Karen Armstrong's A History of God at Book Soup.\n\u2022 Singing sister duo, Aly and AJ\u2019s photoshoot for their EP  Ten Years & promotional tour photos were taken in the parking lot.\n\u2022 The bookstore serves as a location in the 2012 film Celeste and Jesse Forever.\n\nNotes\nExternal links\nOfficial website","31":"\"Blue Jay Way\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles. Written by George Harrison, it was released in 1967 on the group's Magical Mystery Tour EP and album. The song was named after a street in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles where Harrison stayed in August 1967, shortly before visiting the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco. The lyrics document Harrison's wait for music publicist Derek Taylor to find his way to Blue Jay Way through the fog-ridden hills, while Harrison struggled to stay awake after the flight from London to Los Angeles.\nAs with several of Harrison's compositions from this period, \"Blue Jay Way\" incorporates aspects of Indian classical music, even though the Beatles used only Western instrumentation on the track, including a drone-like Hammond organ part played by Harrison. Created during the group's psychedelic period, the track makes extensive use of studio techniques such as flanging, Leslie rotary effect, and reversed tape sounds. The song appeared in the Beatles' 1967 television film Magical Mystery Tour, in a sequence that visually re-creates the sense of haziness and dislocation evident on the recording.\nWhile some reviewers have dismissed the song as monotonous, several others have admired its yearning quality and dark musical mood. The website Consequence of Sound describes \"Blue Jay Way\" as \"a haunted house of a hit, adding an ethereal, creepy mythos to the City of Angels\". Artists who have covered the song include Bud Shank, Colin Newman, Tracy Bonham and Siouxsie and the Banshees.\n\nBackground and inspiration\nGeorge Harrison wrote \"Blue Jay Way\" after arriving in Los Angeles on 1 August 1967 with his wife Pattie Boyd and Beatles aides Neil Aspinall and Alex Mardas. The purpose of the trip was to spend a week with Derek Taylor, the Beatles' former press officer and eventual publicist for California-based acts such as the Byrds and the Beach Boys. The visit also allowed Harrison to reunite with his sitar tutor, Ravi Shankar, whose Kinnara School of Music and upcoming concert at the Hollywood Bowl he helped publicise.\n\nThe title of the song came from a street named Blue Jay Way, one of the \"bird streets\" high in the Hollywood Hills West area overlooking the Sunset Strip, where Harrison had rented a house at 1567 Blue Jay Way for his stay. Jet-lagged after the flight from London, he began writing the composition on a Hammond organ as he and Boyd waited for Taylor and the latter's wife, Joan, to join them. The home's location, on a hillside of narrow, winding roads, together with the foggy conditions that night, created the backdrop for the song's opening lines: \"There's a fog upon LA \/ And my friends have lost their way.\" Harrison had almost completed the song by the time the Taylors arrived, around two hours later than planned.\nThe week with Taylor proved to be important for the direction of the Beatles. At the height of the Summer of Love and the popularity of the band's Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album, Harrison, Taylor and their small entourage visited the international \"hippie capital\" of Haight-Ashbury, in San Francisco, on 7 August. Harrison had expected to encounter an enlightened community engaged in artistic pursuits and working to create a viable alternative lifestyle; instead, he was disappointed that Haight-Ashbury appeared to be populated by drug addicts, dropouts and \"hypocrites\". Following his return to England two days later, Harrison completed work on \"Blue Jay Way\" at his home in Esher, and he shared his disillusionment about Haight-Ashbury with John Lennon. The Beatles then publicly denounced the popular hallucinogen LSD (or \"acid\") and other drugs in favour of Transcendental Meditation under Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, whose seminar in Bangor in Wales the band attended in late August. While noting Harrison's role in \"inspir[ing] the West's mainstream acquaintance with Hindu religion\" through his leadership in this aspect of the Beatles' career, author Ian MacDonald describes \"Blue Jay Way\" as a \"farewell to psychedelia\", just as \"It's All Too Much\", which the Beatles recorded in May 1967, became Harrison's \"farewell to acid\".\n\nComposition\nMusic\n\"Blue Jay Way\" was one of several songs that Harrison composed on a keyboard over 1966\u201368 \u2013 a period when, aside from in his work with the Beatles, he had abandoned his first instrument, the guitar, to master the sitar, partly under Shankar's tutelage. The song is in 4\/4 time throughout; its structure consists of an intro, three combinations of verse and chorus, followed by repeated choruses. While MacDonald gives the musical key as \"C major (minor, diminished)\", musicologist Alan Pollack views it as a mix of C major and C modal, and comments on the \"highly unusual\" incorporation of the notes D\u266f and F\u266f. The inclusion of the latter note suggests the Lydian mode, which, according to musicologist Walter Everett, had only been heard previously in popular music in the Left Banke's 1966 single \"Pretty Ballerina\".\n\nThe song's melody oscillates over the chords of C major and C diminished, a chord favoured by Harrison in his Indian music-inspired compositions for the Beatles. Acknowledging Harrison's statement that the tune is \"slightly Indian\", Everett considers \"Blue Jay Way\" to be related to Kosalam and Multani \u2013 ragas from, respectively, the Carnatic and Hindustani traditions of Indian classical music. Alternatively, ethnomusicologist David Reck says the melody uses the scale from the Carnatic raga Ranjani, while according to author Simon Leng, Harrison based the song partly on the Hindustani Raga Marwa. Following the inclusion of a raga-style introduction (or alap) in his previous Indian compositions, \"Love You To\" and \"Within You Without You\", \"Blue Jay Way\" begins with a preview of the song's melody played softly, in free time, over the opening drone. Author Ian Inglis credits the song's incorporation of ambient drone, specifically its role in providing \"an anchorage point for vocal and instrumental improvisation\", as one of the first examples of a musical device that soon became prevalent in the work of Fairport Convention, the Incredible String Band and other folk artists.\nThe length of the verses falls short of an even eight bars through the omission of a final beat. Pollack recognises this detail as reflecting a sense of impatience, in keeping with the circumstances surrounding the song's creation. Following the third verse\u2013chorus combination, the outro comprises four rounds of the chorus, with the lyrics to the final round consisting of the repeated \"Don't be long\" refrain. As a feature that Pollack terms \"compositionally impressive\", each of the four sections in this outro varies in structure by being either shorter in length or less musically detailed.\n\nLyrics\nThe lyrics to \"Blue Jay Way\" relate entirely to Harrison's situation on that first night in Los Angeles. He refers to fighting off sleep and recalls his advice to Taylor to ask a policeman for directions to Blue Jay Way. Author Jonathan Gould views the song as \"darkly funny\", with the singer's concern over his friends' tardiness almost resembling \"a metaphysical crisis\". In the choruses, Harrison repeatedly urges \"Please don't be long \/ Please don't you be very long\", a refrain that Inglis identifies as central to the composition's \"extraordinary sense of yearning and melancholy\".\nTaylor later expressed amusement at how some commentators interpreted \"don't be long\" as meaning \"don't belong\" \u2013 a message to Western youth to opt out of society \u2013 and at how the line \"And my friends have lost their way\" supposedly conveyed the idea that \"a whole generation had lost direction\". With regard to whether Harrison was telling contemporary listeners not to \"belong\", Inglis writes, this \"alternative reading\" of the song aligned with Timothy Leary's catchphrase for the 1960s American psychedelic experience, \"Turn on, tune in, drop out\". In Gould's opinion, the continual repetition of the line at the end of \"Blue Jay Way\" transforms the words into \"a plea for nonattachment \u2013 'don't belong'\". Rather than attaching any countercultural significance to this, however, Gould views it as the Beatles repeating the wordplay first used in the chorus of Lennon's 1963 song \"It Won't Be Long\".\n\nProduction\nRecording\nThe Beatles began recording \"Blue Jay Way\" on 6 September 1967 at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in London. The song was Harrison's contribution to the television film Magical Mystery Tour, the first project undertaken by the band following the death of their manager, Brian Epstein. Author Nicholas Schaffner describes \"Blue Jay Way\" as the first Harrison-written Beatles recording on which he \"adapt[ed] some of his Indian-derived ideas to a more Western setting\" through the choice of musical instruments. In the song's arrangement, Hammond organ re-creates the drone of a tambura, while a cello acts as an Indian sarod.\nThe group achieved a satisfactory rhythm track in a single take. On 7 September, this recording \u2013 comprising two organ parts, bass guitar and drums \u2013 was reduced to two tracks on the 4-track master tape, after which Harrison overdubbed his double-tracked lead vocal, and he, Lennon and Paul McCartney added backing vocals. Among Beatles biographers, MacDonald credits Harrison as the sole organ player on the song, while Kenneth Womack and John Winn write that Lennon played the second keyboard part. Recording was completed at Abbey Road on 6 October, with the addition of tambourine, played by Ringo Starr, and cello. The latter was performed by an unnamed session musician. As with all the songs recorded for Magical Mystery Tour, final mixing was carried out on 7 November.\n\nStudio effects\n\"Blue Jay Way\" features extensive use of three studio techniques employed by the Beatles over 1966\u201367: flanging, an audio delay effect; sound-signal rotation via a Leslie speaker; and (in the stereo mix only) reversed tapes. Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn compares \"Blue Jay Way\" with two Lennon tracks from this period, \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" and \"I Am the Walrus\", in that the recording \"seized upon all the studio trickery and technical advancements of 1966 and 1967 and captured them in one song\". Together with the pedal drone supplied by the keyboard parts, the various sound treatments reinforce the sense of dislocation evident in the song.\nIn the case of the reversed-tape technique, a recording of the completed track was played backwards and faded in at key points during the performance. This effect created a response to Harrison's lead vocal over the verses, as the backing vocals appear to answer each line he sings. Due to the limits of multitracking, the process of feeding in reversed sounds was carried out live during the final mixing session. Described by Lewisohn as \"quite problematical\", the process was not repeated when the Beatles and their production team worked on the mono mix.\n\nAppearance in Magical Mystery Tour film\nThe song's segment in Magical Mystery Tour was shot mainly at RAF West Malling, an air force base near Maidstone in Kent, during the week beginning on 19 September. Described by Womack as \"the movie's hazy, psychedelic sequence\", it features Harrison sitting on a pavement and playing a chalk-drawn keyboard. Dressed in a red suit, he is shown busking on a roadside; next to his keyboard are a white plastic cup and a message written in chalk, reading: \"2 wives and kid to support\". The depiction of Harrison, seated cross-legged, matched his public image as the most committed of the Beatles to Transcendental Meditation and Eastern philosophy.\n\nThe filming took place in an aircraft hangar, with the scene designed to re-create a typically smog-ridden Los Angeles. Music journalist Kit O'Toole writes that the smoke surrounding Harrison \"almost engulf[s] him, mimicking the 'fog' described in the lyrics\". Through the use of prismatic photography, the \"Blue Jay Way\" segment also shows Harrison's \"image refracted as if seen through a fly's eye\", according to author Alan Clayson, who describes the scene as mirroring \"the requisite misty atmosphere\" suggested by the recording. In its preview of Magical Mystery Tour in 1967, the NME highlighted the segment as one of the film's \"extremely clever\" musical sequences, saying: \"For 'Blue Jay Way' George is seen sitting cross-legged in a sweating mist which materialises into a variety of shapes and patterns. It's a pity that most TV viewers will be able to see it only in black and white.\"\n\nAt other times during the sequence, the four Beatles alternate in the role of a solo cellist. These scenes were filmed on 3 November, on the back rockery at Sunny Heights, Starr's house in Weybridge, Surrey. Tony Barrow, the band's press officer, recalled that as \"a colourful conclusion\" to the segment, they set off fireworks that had been bought for the upcoming Guy Fawkes Night celebrations. The version of \"Blue Jay Way\" appearing in the 2012 DVD release of Magical Mystery Tour is an alternative edit and includes some previously unused footage. O'Toole admires the \"Blue Jay Way\" sequence as \"one of the film's too-few bright spots\" and \"a perfect representation of the track's hallucinatory qualities\".\n\nRelease and reception\n\"Blue Jay Way\" was issued in Britain as the final song on the Magical Mystery Tour double EP on 8 December 1967. In America, where Capitol Records combined the six EP tracks with five songs issued on the band's singles throughout the year, creating a full album, the release took place on 27 November. Reck comments that despite the Beatles' association with the Maharishi and Eastern culture, only two of the six new songs \u2013 \"Blue Jay Way\" and \"I Am the Walrus\" \u2013 directly reflected this interest.\nReviewing the EP for the NME, Nick Logan considered it to be \"Sergeant Pepper and beyond, heading for marvellous places\", during which \"we cruise down 'Blue Jay Way' with [Harrison] almost chanting the chorus line. A church organ starts this one off and leads us into a whirlpool of sound ...\" Bob Dawbarn of Melody Maker lauded the record as \"six tracks which no other pop group in the world could begin to approach for originality combined with the popular touch\". He said \"Blue Jay Way\" had the \"requisite Eastern overtones\" and was a \"sinister little tune\", which made it the hardest track to appreciate immediately.\nAmong reviews of the US release, Mike Jahn of Saturday Review admired the album as a \"description of the Beatles' acquired Hindu philosophy and its subsequent application to everyday life\", while Hit Parader praised the band for further \"widening the gap between them and 80 scillion other groups\". The reviewer added, with reference to the concurrently issued Their Satanic Majesties Request by the Rolling Stones: \"The master magicians practice their alchemy on Harrison's 'Blue Jay Way', recorded perhaps in an Egyptian tomb, and 'I Am The Walrus', a piece of terror lurking in foggy midnight moors. These two songs accomplish what the Stones attempted.\"\nRichard Goldstein of The New York Times rued that, more so than Sgt. Pepper, the soundtrack demonstrated the Beatles' departure from true rock values in favour of studio effects, and he found artifice in the \"waft of foggy music\" accompanying Harrison's declaration that \"There's a fog upon LA\". Typically of Harrison's recent songs, Goldstein continued, \"Blue Jay Way\" was \"filled with fascinating tones and textures\" but the message was confused and laboured, and he complained that it was sung with a vocal that was \"[more] sandpaper than Satori\". Rex Reed, in a highly unfavourable review of the album for HiFi\/Stereo Review, said the song \"consists of three minutes and fifty seconds of the Beatles sounding as if they are singing under water or gargling with Listerine\" and dismissed it as \"boring as hell\". By contrast, Robert Christgau wrote in Esquire that, despite three of the new songs being \"disappointing\", Magical Mystery Tour was \"worth buying ... especially for Harrison's hypnotic 'Blue Jay Way'\". Christgau described the track as \"an adaptation of Oriental modes in which everything works, lyrics included\".\n\nRetrospective assessments\nA critic of the Beatles' output immediately post-Sgt. Pepper, Ian MacDonald found \"Blue Jay Way\" \"as unfocused and monotonous as most of the group's output of this period\", adding that the song \"numbingly fails to transcend the weary boredom that inspired it\". Writing for Rolling Stone in 2002, Greg Kot considered it to be \"one of [Harrison's] least-memorable Beatles tracks \u2026 a song essentially about boredom \u2013 and it sounds like it\". Similarly unimpressed with Magical Mystery Tour, Tim Riley describes \"Blue Jay Way\" as a song that \"goes nowhere tiresomely\", with a vocal that \"sounds as tired and droning\" as the musical accompaniment. In Walter Everett's view, the track's combination of unusual musical scales, reversed tape sounds and imaginative engineering makes it \"the most mysterious Beatles sound between 'Strawberry Fields Forever' and 'Glass Onion'\", but the lyrics are \"dull\" by comparison.\nIan Inglis writes that the emotion Harrison conveys on the track \"belies its apparently trivial lyrics\" and that, together with the instrumentation and backing vocals, his pleas \"create an unusually atmospheric and strangely moving song\". Writing for Rough Guides, Chris Ingham deems the song to be \"essential Beatlemusic\"; he views it as Harrison's \"most haunting and convincing musical contribution of the period\", after \"Within You Without You\", as well as \"possibly the most unnerving of all Beatles tracks\". In a 2002 review for Mojo, Charles Shaar Murray described the song as \"eerie, serpentine\" and \"a fine and worthy companion for Pepper's Within You Without You\". Writing in Uncut that same year, Carol Clerk called it \"a weirdly atmospheric triumph\".\n\nIn his book Indian Music and the West, Gerry Farrell refers to the song when discussing its author's contribution to popularising Indian classical music, writing: \"It is a mark of Harrison's sincere involvement with Indian music that, nearly thirty years on, the Beatles' 'Indian' songs remain among the most imaginative and successful examples of this type of fusion \u2013 for example, 'Blue Jay Way' and 'The Inner Light.'\" Simon Leng writes of the song: \"Harrison was working at a sophisticated level of extrapolating Indian scales to the Western setting, something no one else had done \u2026 'Blue Jay Way' explores the structures of Indian music just as 'Within You Without You' debates its philosophical roots.\" Former Record Collector editor Peter Doggett, writing in Barry Miles' The Beatles Diary, similarly admires the recording, saying that the Beatles rendered the song \"an exotic, almost mystical journey\" that evokes a mysterious Eastern mood \"without a single Indian instrument being employed\". Music critic Jim DeRogatis ranks \"Blue Jay Way\" at number 7 in his list of the Beatles' best psychedelic rock songs.\nIn a 2009 review for Consequence of Sound, Dan Caffrey highlights the track among the \"stellar moments in the album's first half\" and considers it to be \"George Harrison's most underrated song\". Caffrey adds: \"For a piece inspired by the simple act of waiting for a friend to arrive at his Los Angeles home on a foggy night, 'Blue Jay Way' is a haunted house of a hit, adding an ethereal, creepy mythos to the City of Angels.\" Writing for The A.V. Club, Chuck Klosterman describes the song as being among \"the trippiest ... material [the Beatles] ever made\", while Mark Kemp of Paste views it as \"wonderfully wobbly\". Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork includes \"Blue Jay Way\" among the EP's four \"low-key marvels\", saying: \"Few of them are anyone's all-time favorite Beatles songs ... yet this run seems to achieve a majesty in part because of that: It's a rare stretch of amazing Beatles music that can seem like a private obsession rather than a permanent part of our shared culture.\"\nIn 2001, the song was ranked 39th on Uncut's list of \"The 50 Greatest Beatles Tracks\". Q magazine included it in their list of \"The 500 Greatest Lost Tracks\", published in 2007. In 2018, the music staff of Time Out London ranked \"Blue Jay Way\" at number 46 on their list of the best Beatles songs.\n\nCover versions and cultural references\nLord Sitar included \"Blue Jay Way\" on his 1968 album of Indian music-style recordings, titled Lord Sitar. The artist credit was a pseudonym for London session guitarist Big Jim Sullivan, although rumours circulated that Lord Sitar was in fact Harrison himself, partly as a result of EMI\/Capitol's refusal to deny the claim. Also in 1968, jazz saxophonist and flautist Bud Shank, another associate of Ravi Shankar, recorded the song for his album Magical Mystery.\n\"Blue Jay Way\" was a rare Beatles song released before their 1968 self-titled double album that Charles Manson adopted as part of his theory of an impending social revolution in the United States, a scenario that led to his followers carrying out a series of murders in Los Angeles during the summer of 1969. Finding parallels between the Beatles' lyrics and the Book of Revelation, and believing himself to be the messiah, Manson interpreted Harrison's opening verse and chorus as the Beatles calling out to Jesus Christ.\n\nColin Newman, singer and guitarist with the post-punk band Wire, included a cover of \"Blue Jay Way\" on his 1982 solo album Not To. In March 2015, the song was his selection for the NME's \"100 Greatest Beatles Songs\" poll. Newman cited the track as an example of how the Beatles were \"properly serious about their art\" and why they now \"need to be rescued from the clammy clutches of the heritage industry\".\nBorbetomagus released a live recording of the song on their 1992 album Buncha Hair That Long, a version that Trouser Press later said \"could easily reunite the Beatles for good if it were played in the presence of the surviving trio\". On their 2003 live album Seven Year Itch, Siouxsie and the Banshees included a reading that, according to The Guardian's reviewer, \"transformed [the song] into an apocalyptic howl\". Other artists who have covered \"Blue Jay Way\" include Tracy Bonham, on her 2007 album In the City + In the Woods, and the Secret Machines, whose version appears in the Julie Taymor-directed film Across the Universe (2007). Former Cars keyboardist Greg Hawkes recorded a ukulele rendition for his 2008 solo album The Beatles Uke.\n\nHarrison's experience when writing \"Blue Jay Way\" is referenced in the Jonathan Kellerman novel Obsession (2007), as the lead character, Alex Delaware, waits among the \"bird streets\" overlooking Sunset Strip. The US hip hop group Death Grips included a reversed sample of \"Blue Jay Way\" as well as a quote from the song's lyrics in their 2012 track \"Double Helix\", released on The Money Store, an album that Clash magazine described as sounding like \"the burning skies of LA's decaying empire\".\nIn a 2011 interview, music producer and radio host Kim Fowley identified \"Blue Jay Way\" as the first song in which a member of the Beatles wrote about America and cited it as evidence of Harrison's standing as \"the most American of all the Beatles\" during the 1960s. Fowley highlighted this connection \u2013 including Harrison's friendships with David Crosby of the Byrds and other California-based musicians, such as Leon Russell \u2013 as the foundation for rock music's first all-star charity concert, the Concert for Bangladesh, which Harrison staged in New York in August 1971.\nDue to the attention created by the Beatles' song, the street signs for Blue Jay Way have long been collector's items for fans visiting the Hollywood Hills. In May 2015, a lane in the Heavitree area of Exeter, in the English county of Devon, was named Blue Jay Way after the song. In addition to much of the filming for Magical Mystery Tour having taken place at various locations in the West Country, the title commemorates the Beatles' three concert appearances at Exeter's ABC Cinema over 1963\u201364.\n\nPersonnel\nAccording to Ian MacDonald, except where noted:\n\nGeorge Harrison \u2013 lead vocals, Hammond organ, backing vocal\nJohn Lennon \u2013 backing vocal, Hammond organ\nPaul McCartney \u2013 backing vocal, bass guitar\nRingo Starr \u2013 drums, tambourine\nUnnamed session musician \u2013 cello\n\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\nExternal links\nFull lyrics for the song at the Beatles' official website Archived 24 May 2015 at the Wayback Machine\nBlue Jay Way \u2013 Google Maps\nThe REAL Blue Jay Way","32":"A boulevard is a type of broad avenue planted with rows of trees, or in parts of North America, any urban highway or wide road in a commercial district.\nBoulevards were originally circumferential roads following the line of former city walls.\nIn North American usage, boulevards may be wide, multi-lane thoroughfares divided with only a central median.\n\nEtymology\nThe word boulevard is borrowed from French.

A small community sprang up outside that facility's west gate, taking on the name Westgate. Annexed by the City of Los Angeles on June 14, 1916, Westgate's 49 sq mi (130 km2) included large parts of what is now the Pacific Palisades and a small portion of today's Bel-Air. Westgate Avenue is one of the last reminders of that namesake.\n\nLocal traditions include a Maypole erected each year on the lawn of the Archer School for Girls, carrying on that set by the Eastern Star Home previously housed there. This building was the exterior establishing shot for the \"Mar Vista Rest Home\" that provided a key scene in the 1974 film Chinatown.\n\nVery High Fire Hazard Severity Zone designation\nThe State Cal-Fire Authority officially designated Brentwood, from Mulholland down to Sunset Boulevard, a Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone, due to the long, uninterrupted border of urban-wildlife interface in the hillsides that has resulted in multiple fires over many years, destroying entire neighborhoods and requiring numerous evacuations. For this reason, the Brentwood community has been strongly in favor of halting all further development in the hillside and canyon areas.\nOn November 6, 1961, a construction crew working in Sherman Oaks in the San Fernando Valley north of Brentwood on the far side of the Santa Monica Mountains noticed smoke and flames in a nearby pile of rubbish. Within minutes, Santa Ana winds gusting up to 60 mph (100 km\/h) sent burning brush aloft and over the ridge into Brentwood.\nMore than 300 police officers helped evacuate 3,500 residents during the 12-hour fire, and some 2,500 firefighters battled the blaze, pumping water from neighborhood swimming pools to douse flames. Pockets of the fire smoldered for several days. Even as firefighters battled what was to become a Bel Air disaster, another fire erupted in Santa Ynez Canyon to the west. That blaze was contained the next day after consuming nearly 10,000 acres (40 km2) and nine structures and burning to within a mile of Bel Air and Brentwood. The fires were the fifth-worst conflagration in the nation's history at the time, burning 16,090 acres (65 km2), destroying more than 484 homes and 190 other structures and causing an estimated $30 million in damage.\n\nO. J. Simpson murder case\nBrentwood was the site of the 1994 stabbing deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, outside Nicole Brown Simpson's Bundy Drive townhouse. Nicole's ex-husband, football player and actor O. J. Simpson, was acquitted of the murders, but was later found liable for the deaths in a civil trial. O. J. Simpson's Brentwood home was subsequently sold. The new owners demolished Simpson's home and built a new residence.\n\nGeography\nBoundaries\nThe district is located at the base of the Santa Monica Mountains, bounded by the San Diego Freeway on the east, Wilshire Boulevard on the south, the Santa Monica city limits on the southwest, Sullivan Canyon\/Westridge Trail on the west and Mulholland Drive on the north.\n\nEnvironment\nBrentwood, like nearby Santa Monica, has a temperate climate influenced by marine breezes off the Pacific Ocean. Residents frequently wake to a \"marine layer\", a cover of clouds brought in at night which burns off by mid-morning. The topography is generally split into two characters, broadly divided by Sunset Boulevard: the area north of Sunset is defined by ridges and canyons of the Santa Monica Mountains and is located in a Cal-Fire designated Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone; south of Sunset the area is mostly flat. The area South of San Vicente features an underground spring which bubbles up into a small creek along \"the Gully\" near the Brentwood Country Club.\n\nDemographics\nThe 2000 U.S. census counted 31,344 residents in the 15.22-square-mile Brentwood neighborhood\u2014or 2,059 people per square mile. In 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 33,312.\nThe population was 84.2% Non-Hispanic White, 6.5% Asian American, 4.5% Hispanic or Latino, 1.2% African American, and 3.6% of other origins. Iran (27.2%) and the United Kingdom (4.8%) were the most common places of birth for the 21.1% of the residents who were born abroad\u2014which was a low percentage for Los Angeles as a whole. The median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $112,927, high for the city of Los Angeles as well as the county.\n\nNotable sights\nSan Vicente Boulevard is divided by a wide median on which stand many large coral trees. This green belt replaced a Pacific Electric trolley track, and the trees have been named a City of Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument.\nBrentwood features a number of residential sub-districts:\n\nBrentwood Circle: a gated community east of Barrington and north of Sunset that was created when the Getty Museum was built.\nBrentwood Glen: an area bounded by Sunset, the 405 Freeway, and the Veterans Administration, it is an enclave of small lots and single family homes\nBundy Canyon: home to Mount St. Mary's College and an emergency ingress entrance to Getty Center (though the latter is accessible only from Sepulveda for the public)\nCrestwood Hills: includes a cluster of protected, architecturally significant mid-century modern residences located in the northern part of Kenter Canyon\nMandeville Canyon: westernmost part of Brentwood, north of Sunset; extends about three miles to the north and is the longest dead end street in the City of Los Angeles.\nSullivan Canyon: a mostly equestrian neighborhood with a private riding ring.\nThe \"Polo Field\": situated at Will Rogers State Park near Paul Revere Middle School and the Riviera Golf Club\nBrentwood Park: large estates located in a zone bordered by Oakmont, San Vicente, Allenford and Cliffwood Drive.\nBrentwood Terrace: Located between the Brentwood Country Mart and Brentwood Country Club\nEach sub-district is represented by a different homeowners association.\n\nRecreation\nBrentwood's Barrington Recreation Center has an indoor gymnasium which converts into a small auditorium with a capacity of 250. Outdoors is a lighted baseball diamond, an unlighted baseball diamond, lighted indoor basketball courts, lighted outdoor basketball courts, a children's play area, picnic tables and lighted tennis courts. As of March 2018, Barrington Park received a grade of \"D\" from the Los Angeles Parks and Recreation Department due its poor facilities; upon investigation, the Brentwood Community Council discovered $1.1 million in missing funds that were supposed to be used for capital upgrades at the park and successfully fought the city for their return. With the funds back in place, the Community has worked to improve the park. The Barrington Dog Park is across the street from the recreation center and is part of Barrington Veterans Park, which is owned by the West LA VA and leased to the City of Los Angeles.\n\nEconomy and businesses\nThe vast majority of office space in Brentwood is rented to professional services firms: accountants, lawyers, medical care.\nThere are three upscale commercial areas: Brentwood Country Mart, Barrington Plaza and the San Vicente Business District, which include restaurants, clothing stores, and other high-end retailers.\nA few long time businesses should be noted: Brent-Air Pharmacy, run by the founding Lassoff family from its inception until June 2007, served Brentwood for more than 50 years. The drug store has been the scene of many famous scandals and, like its defunct West Hollywood cousin Schwab's, is known as the pharmacy to the stars, where many now-notable actors and actresses worked as delivery boys or \"candy counter\" girls.\nThe Brentwood Country Mart, near the corner of San Vicente Blvd and 26th Street next to the Santa Monica city limit, is a shopping and food center that first opened in 1948.\nVicente Foods is an independently owned and operated grocery market that has served Brentwood since 1948. Other local markets include Whole Foods and Ralphs.\nA popular area for dining and coffee for local residents is located in Brentwood Village at the intersection of Barrington and Sunset. More than a dozen restaurants and coffee shops are located within a two-block stretch offering a wide variety of cuisine.\nDutton's Brentwood Books, a local landmark called by Sunset magazine \"the last of the truly independent bookstores\", closed its doors in April 2008.\n\nGovernment and infrastructure\nBrentwood leadership and city services\nBrentwood and Pacific Palisades both chose to form community councils in order to have an independent voice with regard to issues that impact their communities, such as their joint Community Plan, which is a City approved document that governs the aesthetics of zoning and design for the neighborhoods. The Brentwood Community Council holds monthly public meetings, as does its Land Use Committee, and has been a powerful and effective voice for the community since the 1990s. The BCC Board includes members from all local HOA's, plus members representing schools, business, environment, transportation, civic affairs and a group dedicated only to residents under 40, called Brentwood '49. City Services are provided by the Los Angeles Fire Department Station 19 in Brentwood. The Los Angeles Police Department operates the West Los Angeles Community Police Station in West Los Angeles, serving Brentwood. The City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power provide utilities. All areas of Brentwood are served by a Residents Association of some kind.\n\nWest LA VA and VA Master Plan Redevelopment\nWhile the annual County of Los Angeles homeless count rarely attributes more than 50 persons as homeless in Brentwood, the majority of the homeless persons are Veterans. While the VA does have available beds and treatment programs, many Veterans find it hard to take the first step to accept VA assistance for a variety of reasons, including deep mistrust of the VA, dishonorable discharges that prevent them from receiving services, the mandatory sober living environment on the VA campus. The Brentwood Community Council took the lead in 2013 to help establish Veteran safe parking and safe camping programs, which allow Veterans to take an 'intermediate step\" between homelessness and accepting full VA assistance and these programs have been successful and have grown over time. Some Veterans believed the VA was derelict in its duty to provide housing and successfully sued the VA, proving that multiple leases of VA property had been used for fraudulent means. Several individuals went to prison, including a former VA executive. As a result of the settlement in the Veterans civil suit against the VA, the $1B VA Master Plan Redevelopment of the West LA VA property, including 2000+ units of housing, was approved by Congress in 2019 and was completed in late 2020.\n\nCounty\nThe Los Angeles County Department of Health Services SPA 5 West Area Health Office serves Brentwood.

The group, widely known for the song \"For What It's Worth\", released three albums and several singles from 1966 to 1968. Their music combined elements of folk music and country music with influences from the British Invasion and psychedelic rock. Like contemporary band the Byrds, they were key to the early development of folk rock. The band took their name from a steamroller parked outside their house.\nBuffalo Springfield formed in Los Angeles in 1966 with Stills (guitar, keyboards, vocals), Martin (drums, vocals), Palmer (bass guitar), Furay (guitar, vocals) and Young (guitar, harmonica, piano, vocals). The band signed to Atlantic Records in 1966 and released their debut single \"Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing\", which became a hit in Los Angeles. The following January, they released the protest song \"For What It's Worth\", which became their only US top 10 hit and a counterculture anthem. Their second album, Buffalo Springfield Again, marked their progression to psychedelia and hard rock and featured songs such as \"Bluebird\" and \"Mr. Soul\".\nAfter several drug-related arrests and line-up changes, the group disbanded in 1968. Their third and final album, Last Time Around, was compiled and released shortly after their dissolution. Stephen Stills went on to form the supergroup Crosby, Stills & Nash with David Crosby of the Byrds and Graham Nash of the Hollies. Neil Young launched his solo career and later joined Stills in Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young in 1969. Furay, along with Jim Messina, went on to form the country-rock band Poco. Buffalo Springfield was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997, and briefly reunited for a comeback tour in 2011.\n\nHistory\nOrigins\nNeil Young and Stephen Stills met in 1965, at the Fourth Dimension in Thunder Bay, Ontario. Young was there with the Squires, a Winnipeg group he had been leading since February 1963, and Stills was on tour with the Company, a spin-off from the Au Go Go Singers. When Stills' band broke up at the end of that tour, he moved to the West Coast, where he worked as a session musician and auditioned unsuccessfully for, among other bands, the Monkees. Told by record producer Barry Friedman there would be work available if he could assemble a band, Stills invited fellow Au Go Go Singers alumnus Richie Furay and former Squires bass player Ken Koblun to come join him in California. Both agreed, although Koblun chose to leave before very long and joined the group 3's a Crowd.\nWhile in Toronto in early 1966, Young met Bruce Palmer, a Canadian who was playing bass for the Mynah Birds. In need of a lead guitarist, Palmer invited Young to join the group, and Young accepted. The Mynah Birds were set to record an album for Motown Records when their singer Ricky James Matthews\u2014James Ambrose Johnson, Jr., later known as Rick James\u2014was tracked down and arrested by the U.S. Navy for being AWOL.\nWith their record deal cancelled, Young and Palmer pawned the Mynah Birds' musical equipment and bought a 1953 Pontiac hearse, which they drove to Los Angeles. Young and Palmer arrived in L.A. hoping to meet Stephen Stills, who, as Young had learned, was living in the city. However, after almost a week of searching clubs and coffeehouses, the pair had been unable to find Stills. Consequently, on April 6, 1966, Young and Palmer decided to leave Los Angeles and drive north to San Francisco. While the two were stuck in traffic on Sunset Boulevard, they were spotted by Stills and Richie Furay, who were heading the other direction down Sunset. Stills and Furay managed to switch lanes and maneuver behind Young's hearse, at which point the musicians pulled off the road and reunited.\nDrummer Dewey Martin, who had played with garage rock group the Standells and with country artists such as Patsy Cline and the Dillards, joined at the suggestion of the Byrds' manager, Jim Dickson. The group's name was taken from a brand of steamroller made by the Buffalo-Springfield Roller Company. The new group debuted on 11 April 1966, at The Troubadour in West Hollywood, five days after the chance encounter on Sunset Boulevard. A few days later, they began a short tour of California as the opening act for the Dillards and the Byrds.\n\nManagement and first recordings\nChris Hillman of the Byrds persuaded the owners of the Whisky a Go Go to give Buffalo Springfield an audition, and they essentially became the house band at the Whisky for seven weeks, from May 2 to June 18, 1966. This series of concerts solidified the band's reputation for live performances and attracted interest from a number of record labels. It also brought an invitation from Friedman to Dickie Davis (who had been the Byrds' lighting manager) to become involved in the group's management. In turn, Davis sought advice from Sonny & Cher's management team, Charlie Greene and Brian Stone; unbeknownst to Davis and Friedman, Greene and Stone then aggressively pitched themselves to the band to be their new managers. Friedman was fired, and Davis was made the group's tour manager. Greene and Stone made a deal with Ahmet Ertegun of Atlantic Records for a four-album contract with a $12,000 advance, following a brief bidding war with Elektra Records and Warner Bros. Records, and arranged for the band to start recording at Gold Star Studios in Hollywood.\n\nThe first Buffalo Springfield single, \"Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing\", was released in August, but made little impact outside Los Angeles, where it reached the top 25. Young and Stills have long maintained that their own mono mix was superior to the stereo mix engineered by Greene and Stone. The band's eponymous album was released by Atlantic subsidiary Atco in mono and in stereo in October 1966. A revamped version issued both in mono and stereo with a different track order was issued in March of the following year.\n\nIn November 1966, Stills composed \"For What It's Worth\", responding to a protest that had turned violent following the closing of the Pandora's Box nightclub on Sunset Strip. The song was performed on Thanksgiving night at the Whisky a Go Go, recorded within the next few days, and on the air in Los Angeles on radio station KHJ soon afterwards. By March 1967, it was a top ten hit. Atco took advantage of this momentum by replacing the song \"Baby Don't Scold Me\" with \"For What It's Worth\" and re-releasing the album. \"For What It's Worth\" sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc.\n\nLineup changes, arrest, and breakup\nIn January 1967, Palmer was deported for possession of marijuana but returned to the group at the beginning of June, while Young was temporarily absent (guitarist Doug Hastings filled in for Young during this period). The band, with David Crosby sitting in, played the Monterey Pop Festival. Young returned in August and the band severed ties with Greene and Stone, then divided its time between playing gigs and finalising the second album, ultimately titled Buffalo Springfield Again. Produced by Ertegun, Buffalo Springfield Again was released in November 1967. It includes \"Mr. Soul\", \"Rock & Roll Woman\", \"Bluebird\", \"Sad Memory\", and \"Broken Arrow\". The band toured as support for the Beach Boys during early 1968. In January of that year, after Palmer was again deported for drug possession, Jim Messina, who had worked as engineer on the band's second album, was hired as a permanent replacement on bass. During this period Young began to appear less and less frequently, and he often left Stills to handle lead guitar parts at concerts. Recording sessions were booked, and all the songs that appeared on the final album were recorded by the end of March, usually with Messina producing.\nIn the Netflix documentary Echo in the Canyon, Stills related an incident that illustrated the band's problems with law enforcement. The band were hosting a small rehearsal party, attended by Eric Clapton among others, in April 1968. Despite reportedly playing at a comfortable sound level, a police officer arrived after a disturbing the peace complaint. During the encounter, the officer smelled marijuana and Stills ran next door to \"call lawyers,\" but in actuality went next door and escaped out the bathroom window. According to Stills, Young was going to chase the police down the street, to which Stills said \"cause he's Canadian and I guess in Canada you can do that\". Ultimately, Young, Furay and Messina were arrested and sent to the Los Angeles County Jail.\nFollowing a gig at the Long Beach Auditorium on 5 May 1968, the band held a meeting with Ertegun to arrange their breakup. Stills and Furay stayed with Atlantic, while Young moved to Warner Brothers. Later, Furay and Messina compiled various tracks recorded between mid-1967 and early 1968 into the third and final studio album, Last Time Around (1968).\n\nNew Buffalo Springfield and reunion attempts\nMartin formed a new version of Buffalo Springfield in September 1968. Dubbed New Buffalo Springfield, the lineup consisted of guitarists Dave Price (Davy Jones's stand-in with the Monkees), Gary Rowles (son of jazz pianist Jimmy Rowles) who later joined Arthur Lee's Love, bass player Bob Apperson, drummer Don Poncher (also later a member of Love), and horn player Jim Price, who later became a top session musician for Delaney Bramlett, the Rolling Stones, Joe Cocker and others.\nThe new band toured extensively and appeared at the highly publicized Holiday Rock Festival in San Francisco on 25\u201326 December 1968, but soon ran afoul of Stills and Young, who took legal action to prevent Martin from using the band's name. Following an agreement to give up future royalties from Buffalo Springfield's recordings, Martin was allowed to use the name New Buffalo. He attempted to retrieve his rights in 1974 and though the matter was settled out of court, he felt that he had been mistreated.\nIn February 1969, Martin and Dave Price formed a second version of New Buffalo with guitarist Bob \"BJ\" Jones and bass player Randy Fuller, brother of the late Bobby Fuller. The band made some recordings with producer Tom Dowd overseeing, but they were scrapped. Another guitarist, Joey Newman (formerly of Don and the Goodtimes, later of the pioneering prog group Touch), was added in June 1969, but two months later Martin was fired, and the remaining members carried on as Blue Mountain Eagle. Martin then formed a new group called Medicine Ball, which released a lone album in 1970 for Uni Records. Martin also released two solo singles, one for Uni and one for RCA, which did not appear on the album. During the 1970s, he retired from the music industry and became a car mechanic.\nIn 1984, Bruce Palmer teamed up with Frank Wilks (vocals, guitar), Stan Endersby (guitar) and Alan Prosser (drums) to form the Springfield Band, which became Buffalo Springfield Revisited in 1985 when Dewey Martin was brought up to Toronto to join, and off they went on tour for the next three to four years under this band name (though Martin dropped out by 1987). Neil Young and Stephen Stills gave Buffalo Springfield Revisited permission to tour with that name.\nIn July 1986, Palmer, Martin, Furay, Young and Stills gathered at Stills' house, with Buffalo Springfield Revisited keyboardist Harlan Spector, to rehearse for an apparent reunion tour. One of the 1986 rehearsals was video recorded. It was the last time all five original members performed together. Plans for a subsequent reunion tour were abandoned.\nBy 1990, Bruce Palmer and Frank Wilks had moved to Topanga, California, where Dennis Knicely joined to perform percussion. The following year they started White Buffalo along with Dewey Martin and others, then Martin formed the short lived Buffalo Springfield Again in 1991 with Billy Darnell (guitar), Robin Lambe (bass) and Michael Curtis (vocals, guitar). But Furay issued a cease and desist order on Martin in 1992, and Martin retired from music again the following year.\n\n2010\u201311 reunion\nOn his album Silver & Gold (2000), Young sang of his desire to re-form the group and to \"see those guys again and give it a shot\" in \"Buffalo Springfield Again\". Palmer (2004) and Martin (2009) later died, preventing a reunion of the original lineup.\nYoung, Stills and Furay reunited at the annual Bridge School Benefit concerts on October 23 and 24, 2010, in Mountain View, California. Rolling Stone called the performance \"nostalgic, blissful, and moving\".\nThe band reunited for six concerts starting in Oakland on 1 June 2011, followed by dates in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara, before moving on to play the 2011 Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival in Manchester, Tennessee. The band consisted of Furay, Stills, Young, Rick Rosas and Joe Vitale. According to Furay and a band spokesman, the group planned a full tour in 2012, but this was delayed because Young was recording two new albums with Crazy Horse. On 27 February 2012, Furay announced that the band was on indefinite hiatus.\n\nLegacy\nIn 1968, Stills went on to form Crosby, Stills & Nash with David Crosby of the Byrds and Graham Nash of the Hollies. Meanwhile, Furay and Messina formed Poco, and Young launched his solo career. In 1969, Young reunited with Stills in Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. After Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, Stills joined with another former Byrd Chris Hillman (after his stint with the Flying Burrito Brothers) and others to form the group Manassas (1971\u20131973). Later, Furay joined J.D. Souther and Chris Hillman to form the Souther-Hillman-Furay Band, and Messina teamed with Kenny Loggins in Loggins & Messina.\nIn 1982\u20131983, Palmer was a bassist on Young's album Trans and toured with him in America and Europe, as seen on Neil Young in Berlin, filmed in 1982.\nIn 1997, Buffalo Springfield was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. A four-disc box set assembled by Young, Buffalo Springfield, was released in 2001. A further box set What's That Sound? Complete Albums Collection was released in 2018 by Rhino Records.\n\nPersonnel\nJim Fielder \u2013 bass guitar (1966, 1967)\nRichie Furay \u2013 guitar, vocals (1966\u20131968, 2010\u20132012)\nBruce Palmer \u2013 bass guitar (1966\u20131968; died 2004)\nStephen Stills \u2013 guitar, keyboards, vocals (1966\u20131968, 2010\u20132012)\nNeil Young \u2013 guitar, harmonica, piano, vocals (1966\u20131968, 2010\u20132012)\nDewey Martin \u2013 drums, vocals (1966\u20131968; died 2009)\nKen Forssi \u2013 bass guitar (1967; died 1998)\nKen Koblun \u2013 bass guitar (1967)\nDoug Hastings \u2013 guitar (1967)\nJim Messina \u2013 bass guitar, vocals (1968)\nAdditional musicians\n\nRick Rosas \u2013 bass guitar (2010\u20132012; died 2014)\nJoe Vitale \u2013 drums, vocals (2010\u20132012)\nRusty Young \u2013 steel guitar on \"Last Time Around\" (died 2021)\n\nDiscography\nStudio albums\nCompilations\nSingles\nReferences\nFurther reading\nEinarson, J. and Furay, R.

Located at 6121 Sunset Boulevard in the Hollywood neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, United States, the building housed the CBS Radio Network's West Coast facilities, as well as CBS's original Los Angeles radio stations, KNX and KCBS-FM. KNXT-TV, Channel 2 (now KCBS-TV) moved into the complex in 1960, and the CBS's West Coast operations were based there until it moved to the larger CBS Television City in November 1952. After its purchase by CBS in 2002, KCAL-TV moved to the Square from studios adjacent to CBS's corporate sibling Paramount Pictures. Between 2004 and 2007 all of these operations moved to other facilities in the Los Angeles area.\n\nArchitecture and dedication\nColumbia Square was built for KNX and as the Columbia Broadcasting System's West Coast operations headquarters on the site of the Nestor Film Company, Hollywood's first movie studio. The Christie Film Company eventually took over operation of Nestor Studios and filmed comedies on the site, originally the location of an early Hollywood roadhouse. Prior to moving to Columbia Square, KNX had been situated at several Hollywood locations.\nColumbia Square was designed by Swiss-born architect William Lescaze in the style of International Modernism and built over a year at a cost of two million dollars \u2014 more money than had ever been spent on a broadcasting facility.\nLescaze's sweeping streamline motifs, porthole windows and glass brick were true to Modernist design, though CBS President William Paley insisted the Square's form follow function. In his dedicatory speech, he remarked, \"It is because we believe these new Hollywood headquarters, reflecting many innovations of design and acoustics and control, will improve the art of broadcasting that we have built them and are dedicating them here tonight.\"\nColumbia Square opened April 30, 1938, with a full day of special broadcasts culminating in the star-studded evening special, \"A Salute to Columbia Square\" featuring Bob Hope, Al Jolson and Cecil B. DeMille. Crowds thronged Sunset Boulevard and a blimp bathed in searchlights hovered overhead as the program was carried coast-to-coast on the Columbia Broadcasting System, beamed to Europe via short wave, and carried across Canada on the CBC. On that premiere broadcast, Hope joked that Columbia Square looked like \"the Taj Mahal with a permanent wave.\" Jolson quipped, \"It looks like Flash Gordon's bathroom.\"\nThe Square's original configuration included eight studios. Studios 1 through 4 were to the left of the main entrance.  Upstairs were Studios 5 through 7 and at the rear of the forecourt was the large auditorium referred to as the \"Columbia Playhouse\" that seated 1050.  In 1940, two new audience theatres were added to the east of the auditorium called \"Studio B\" and \"Studio C\" each seating approximately 350 people. Shows such as Jack Benny's Lucky Strike Program and The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet originated from Studio B. Lucille Ball's My Favorite Husband, Blondie, and Dr. Christian are a few of the shows that broadcast from Studio C.  When B and C were built, the Columbia Playhouse then took the letter designation of \"Studio A\".  Studio A was home to The Silver Theatre, The Swan Show starring George Burns and Gracie Allen, The Lady Esther Screen Guild Players and countless others. The complex included Brittingham's Radio Center Restaurant, a men's clothing store, and a branch of the Bank of America. Tours of the studios cost 40 cents and passed by a glass-windowed control room housing Columbia's West Coast master control.\n\"Columbia Square was one of the glories of radio. It was somewhat sacred to those in the industry. There was nothing comparable to its splendor in New York\" says writer-producer Norman Corwin whose most famous broadcast, On a Note of Triumph, originated from the Square on VE Day, 1945.\nIn early 2009, the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission and the City Council designated CBS Columbia Square Studios as a historic-cultural monument.\n\nPrograms\nColumbia Square became home to some of the best-known comedies of radio's golden age. Jack Benny, Burns and Allen, Edgar Bergen, Red Skelton, Eve Arden (Our Miss Brooks), Jack Oakie and Steve Allen sparked to the airways from the Square.\nDramas included Suspense; Gunsmoke; and Man Behind the Gun, written, directed and produced by William N. Robson; Dr. Christian, \"The Whistler\", Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar, The CBS Radio Workshop, where author Aldous Huxley introduced a production of Brave New World and Columbia Presents Corwin \u2014 dramas produced by Norman Corwin.\nIn May 1945 Corwin's \"On A Note Of Triumph\" was produced in studio A marking the end of the war in Europe and to mark the end of the second world war Corwin produced \"14 August\" in Studio A.\nMusical acts that performed at Columbia Square included Eddie Cantor, Rosemary Clooney, Bing Crosby, Doris Day and Gene Autry. Composer Bernard Hermann frequently scored and conducted Columbia Square broadcasts. Through the facilities of KNX, the Columbia network broadcast big band music from nearby ballrooms including the Hollywood Palladium and the Earl Caroll Theater.\nWhen The Bing Crosby Show moved to CBS in 1949 it took over space on the second floor of the east side of Columbia Square.  A tape recording and editing facility also was built there to support the show.  It was the first facility of its kind to support a national radio show.  The recording sessions and the audience shows were usually held in the CBS theater at 1615 Vine Street just south of Hollywood Boulevard.  With the new three recorder facility, the radio show evolved from a cut and splice operation into one that was created from many different recording sessions with audience reactions incorporated.  It was new territory explored by the Crosby team.\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s Columbia Square also served as a CBS television facility. In 1948, the first West Coast-based variety program, The Ed Wynn Show, was produced on Stage A. Lucille Ball's first national TV appearance took place on The Ed Wynn Show in December 1949 (aired on the East Coast just after New Year). Within the year Stage A would be the location of the shooting of the pilot episode of I Love Lucy.\nIn the 2005 KNX broadcast, A Salute to Columbia Square, announcer George Walsh recalled crowds jamming the Square's forecourt for tickets to live broadcasts. (Ushers would sometimes walk down Sunset Boulevard to NBC's studios at Vine Street to urge audience members to watch a Columbia Square broadcast instead.) After their on-air appearances, actors would dash to the Radio Actors Telephone Exchange in the Square's lobby to check with their agents about their next bookings.\nIn 2007, KCRW and other public radio stations broadcast \"Remembering Columbia Square: A Salute to a Palace of Broadcasting\" featuring Norman Corwin, George Burns, Jack Benny, Jim Hawthorne, Janet Waldo, Art Gilmore, Alan Young, Herb Ellis, Art Linkletter, Gil Stratton, Harry Shearer, Marie Wilson, Mel Baldwin and sound effects man Ray Erlenborn.  The program was produced by Gerald Zelinger.\nBob Crane was a top-rated KNX deejay at Columbia Square in the 1960s and James Dean worked as an usher. Some of the Square's once-luxurious radio theaters were converted to recording studios for Columbia Records where Bob Dylan, Barbra Streisand and many other top stars recorded albums.\n\nAdaptive reuse\nKNX moved into new studios in the Miracle Mile neighborhood on L.A.'s Wilshire Boulevard which it shares with Entercom Radio stations KFWB, KTWV, and KRTH. KNX, the last radio station to operate in Hollywood, moved after 67 years of operation at the Square just after 11:00 p.m. August 12, 2005, following a farewell broadcast from its Columbia Square studios.  On April 21, 2007, KCBS-TV and KCAL-TV left the building and moved their operations to the CBS Studio Center in Studio City, thus ending Columbia Square's status as a broadcast facility, one of a very few remaining in Hollywood.\nThe Square fell into disrepair during the years in which Laurence Tisch chaired CBS, and asbestos problems were cited as a reason to demolish the venue. Sungow Corp acquired Columbia Square in 2003 for $15 million. Las Vegas-based developer Molasky Pacific LLC, acquired the property in August 2006 for $66 million. It planned to redevelop the 125,000-square-foot (11,600 m2) complex to continue to attract entertainment industry tenants and is considering options that would add some residential units to the office and broadcasting facility.  The project is valued at $850-million and is the largest development project in Hollywood, California.  The redevelopment of the historic CBS Studios on Sunset was approved in 2009 with a controversial 28-story tower. Developer Kilroy Realty Group acquired the project in 2012 and changed plans \u2014 when completed the new Columbia Square will feature a 20-story residential tower with 200 apartments, 33,000 sq ft (3,100 m2) of retail, three renovated historic structures, two new office buildings with an additional 330,000 sq ft (31,000 m2) of space, and four and a half levels of underground parking. The development was under construction by 2014.\nIn fall 2007, producer Viacom, owner of CBS until 2005, chose the site for MTV's The Real World: Hollywood.\nThe National Trust for Historic Preservation and Los Angeles Conservancy have been actively engaged in efforts to preserve the Hollywood landmark.\nIn November 2014, Kilroy Realty Group announced that Viacom would be leasing most of the space in one of the new office buildings on the site, for the West Coast offices of its cable television networks, including MTV, Comedy Central, BET, TV Land and Spike TV; these offices had been in Santa Monica and other parts of the Los Angeles area. (Spike TV rebranded as Paramount Network in 2018; Viacom and CBS re-merged in 2019 to form ViacomCBS, later Paramount Global.)\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nCBS corporate website\nCBS Radio website\nColumbia Broadcasting System at the Museum of Broadcast Communications.\nA Salute to Columbia Square 2005 documentary detailing the Hollywood landmark's history by Michael Linder.

The portion of Broadway from 3rd to 9th streets, in the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, was the city's main commercial street from the 1910s until World War II, and is the location of the Broadway Theater and Commercial District, the first and largest historic theater district listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). With twelve movie palaces located along a six-block stretch of Broadway, it is the only large concentration of movie palaces left in the United States.\n\nRoute\nSouth Broadway's southern terminus is Main Street just north of the San Diego Freeway (I-405) in Carson. From there it runs 10 miles (16 km) north through Athens and South Los Angeles to Downtown Los Angeles \u2013 at Olympic Blvd. entering downtown's Historic Core, in which the buildings lining Broadway form the Broadway Theater and Commercial District. Crossing 3rd Street, Broadway passes through the Civic Center including Grand Park. After crossing the US-101 (Santa Ana Freeway), signs read \"North Broadway\" as it enters Chinatown. It then curves northeast, passing through old railyards, crosses the Golden State Fwy. (I-5) and heads due east to its terminus at Mission Road in Lincoln Heights.\n\nHistory\nFounding and extension\nBroadway, one of the oldest streets in the city, was laid out as part of the 1849 plan of Los Angeles made by Lieutenant Edward Ord and named Fort Street. Fort Street began at the south side of Fort Moore Hill (a block north of Temple Street) at Sand Street (later California Street).\nIn 1890, the name of Fort Street, from 1st Street to 10th Street, was changed to Broadway. The rest of Fort Street, from California Street to 1st Street, was changed to North Broadway.\nProposal for opening Broadway through to Buena Vista Street (now North Broadway), and extending the street south into what was then part of Main Street, below Tenth Street, in order to give a continuous, wide thoroughfare from the southern city limits to the Eastside, was made as early as February 1891.\nThe Broadway Tunnel under Fort Moore Hill was opened in 1901, extending North Broadway to Buena Vista Street at Bellevue Avenue (later Sunset Boulevard, now Cesar Chavez Avenue). A section of Broadway in South Los Angeles was originally named Moneta Avenue until 1923.\nIn 1909, construction on a bridge across the Los Angeles River was begun to connect Buena Vista Street to Downey Avenue, which ran from the river to Mission Road. The names of Buena Vista and Downey were then changed to North Broadway, but not without significant objections from affected residents and landowners. The bridge, which continued to be referred to as the Buena Vista Street Bridge for a good while, was opened to traffic in late September 1911.\n\nLos Angeles' central commercial and entertainment street\nFor more than 50 years, Broadway from 1st Street to Olympic Boulevard was the main commercial street of Los Angeles, and one of its premier theater and movie palace districts as well. It contains a vast number of historic buildings and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nPrior to the turn of the 20th century, the city's Central Business District was further north, along Spring and Main streets between the Plaza and 2nd Street. In 1895 J.W. Robinson's opened what was then considered a very large and impressive four-story department store at 239 S. Broadway, signaling of the shift over the next decade and a half of the main shopping district to Broadway below 2nd Street.\n\nRetail hub\nFrom around 1905 through the 1950s, Broadway was considered the center of the city, where residents went to ornate movie palaces and live theaters, and shopped at major department stores and shops. See the Table of department stores on Broadway and Seventh streets below.\nThe square footage of the four largest department stores alone \u2014 Bullock's at 806,000 sq ft (74,900 m2), The Broadway at 577,000 sq ft (53,600 m2), May Co. at over 1,000,000 sq ft (93,000 m2) and J. W. Robinson's (7th St. at Hope) at 623,700 sq ft (57,940 m2) \u2014 totaled over three million square feet, the size of American Dream Meadowlands, America's largest mall today.\nAmong dozens of significant buildings from that era are the Bradbury Building, Ace Hotel Los Angeles, and the Los Angeles Examiner building designed by Julia Morgan.\nSome of the movie theaters on the street fell into disuse and disrepair, some were replaced with parking lots, but many have been repurposed and\/or restored. The department stores closed in the 1970s and 1980s, but Broadway has been the premier shopping destination for working class Latinos for decades.\n\nTheater District\nNRHP refers to the district as the Broadway Theater and Commercial District, while the City of Los Angeles Planning Department refers to the Broadway Theater and Entertainment District.\n\nHighest concentration of movie palaces in the world\nStretching for six blocks from Third to Ninth Streets, the district includes 12 movie theaters built between 1910 and 1931. By 1931, the district had the highest concentration of cinemas in the world, with seating capacity for more than 15,000 patrons. Broadway was the hub of L.A.'s entertainment scene \u2013 a place where \"screen goddesses and guys in fedoras rubbed elbows with Army nurses and aircraft pioneers.\" In 2006, the Los Angeles Times wrote:\"There was a time, long ago, when the streets of downtown Los Angeles were awash in neon\u2014thanks to a confluence of movie theaters the world had never seen before. Dozens of theaters screened Hollywood's latest fare, played host to star-studded premieres and were filled nightly with thousands of moviegoers. In those days, before World War II, downtown L.A. was the movie capital of the world.\"\nColumnist Jack Smith called it \"the only large concentration of vintage movie theaters left in America.\" Smith recalled growing up a mile from Broadway and spending his Saturdays in the theaters:\"I remember walking into those opulent interiors, surrounded by the glory of the Renaissance, or the age of Baroque, and spending two or three hours in the dream world of the movies. When I came out again the sky blazed; the heat bounced off the sidewalk, traffic sounds filled the street, I was back in the hard reality of the Depression.\nBecause Broadway has been used as a filming location for decades, many of these theatre marquees can be seen in classic Hollywood films, including Safety Last! (1923), D.O.A. (1950), The Omega Man (1971), Blade Runner (1982), and The Artist (2011).\n\nRevitalization by Spanish-language cinema\nIn the years after World War II, the district began to decline, as first-run movie-goers shifted to the movie palaces in Hollywood, in Westwood Village, and later to suburban multiplexes. After World War II, as Anglo moviegoers moved to the suburbs, many of the Broadway movie palaces became venues for Spanish-language movies and variety shows. In 1988, the Los Angeles Times noted that, without the Hispanic community, \"Broadway would be dead.\" Jack Smith wrote that Broadway had been \"rescued and revitalized\" by \"the Latino renaissance.\"\n\nPreservation and renovation efforts\nThe district has been the subject of preservation and restoration efforts since the 1980s. In 1987, the Los Angeles Conservancy started a program called \"Last Remaining Seats\" in which the old movie palaces were opened each summer to show classic Hollywood movies. In 1994, the Conservancy's associate director, Gregg Davidson, noted: \"When we started this, the naysayers said no one will go downtown to an old theater to see an old movie in the middle of the summer, but we get a number of people who have never seen a movie in a theater with a balcony. The older people (go) for nostalgia. And the movie people\u2014seeing a classic film on a big screen is a different experience.\" After attending a Conservancy screening, one writer noted: \"The other night I went to the movies and was transported to a world of powdered wigs and hoop skirts, a rococo fantasy of gilded cherubs and crystal chandeliers. And then the film started.\"\nDespite preservation efforts, many of the theaters have been converted to other uses, including flea markets and churches. The Broadway movie palaces fell victim to a number of circumstances, including changing demographics and tastes, a downtown location that was perceived as dangerous at night, and high maintenance costs for aging facilities. With the closure of the State Theater in 1998, the Orpheum and the Palace were the only two still screening films.\nIn 2006, the Los Angeles Times wrote: \"Of all of L.A.'s many hidden gems, maybe none is as sparkling nor as hidden as the Broadway theater district downtown.\" Bemoaning the possible loss of such gems, the same writer noted: \"L.A. gave birth to the movies. To lose the astonishing nurseries where the medium grew up would be tragic.\"\n\nBroadway since 2008\nIn 2008, the City of Los Angeles launched a $40-million campaign to revitalize the Broadway district, known as the \"Bringing Back Broadway\" campaign. Some Latino merchants in the district expressed concern that the campaign was an effort to spread the largely Anglo gentrification taking hold in other parts of downtown to an area that has become the city's leading Latino shopping district. A worker at one of the district's bridal shops noted, \"On one side, I like the idea. The only thing is that I don't think they want our types of businesses.\"\nThe Downtown's real estate revitalization, using the City's adaptive reuse ordinance that makes it easier for developers to convert outmoded and\/or vacant office and commercial buildings into residential buildings, has reached the Broadway Historic District. It includes the transformation of the United Artists Theater office tower into the Ace Hotel Los Angeles, and restoration of its movie palace.\nThe Bringing Back Broadway commission is working on further reviving the landmark Los Angeles boulevard in the historic district. Led by City Councilman Jose Huizar, the commission has recommended widening sidewalks, eliminating traffic lanes, constructing new parking structures, and bringing back streetcar service reminiscent of the street's past. A pedestrian-friendly project finished up in December 2014 that widened the sidewalks and replaced the parking lane with planters, chairs and round cafe tables with bright-red umbrellas. The Great Streets Initiative seeks to bolster the street-level health of the city by making several dozen boulevards more hospitable to pedestrians, cyclists and small businesses. Mayor Eric Garcetti said the effort represents \"a shift from the way that our neighborhoods have been planned in Los Angeles,\" with a new focus on \"walkability and transit.\"\nBroadway retail is transitioning from a broad mix of stores catering to Hispanic immigrants and a burgeoning sneaker and streetwear retail cluster has emerged from 4th to 9th streets: Sneaker Row.\nRetail in and around the Eastern Columbia, located at the intersection of 9th Street & Broadway, has proliferated in recent years with the opening of Acne Studios, Oak NYC, Aesop, Tanner Goods, BNKR, Austere, A.P.C., and Urban Outfitters located in the Rialto Theater (Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument No. 472).\n\nBuildings and sites\nAll landmarks in geographic order, north to south:\n\nNorth of Hollywood Freeway\nLittle Joe's (razed), 904 N.

They were as follows:\n\nLos Angeles High School, whose original location (1873-1887) was between New High on the west and Broadway on the east, south of Temple Street. It was moved to California and Sand streets, and in 1890 a new facility was built on Fort Moore Hill, immediately north of where Broadway today crosses the Hollywood Freeway. The Pound Cake Hill school was demolished and replaced by:\nFirst, the Red Stone Courthouse (or \"Red Sandstone Courthouse\"), which took over the function of courthouse from the Clocktower Courthouse (also called the Temple Courthouse). It was damaged beyond repair by Long Beach earthquake of 1933 and was torn down in 1936.\nThe Los Angeles County Hall of Records was built next to (south of) the Red Sandstone Courthouse in 1911, After the 1971 San Fernando earthquake, it was determined to be unsafe and it was demolished in 1973.

New High Street (see Sanborn map above) was a north-south street that ran parallel to Broadway, and to Spring Street to its east. As part of the construction of City Hall in the early 1920s, New High Street was removed south of Temple, and Spring Street was realigned more towards a north-south orientation, parallel with Broadway, instead of running more northeasterly and meeting Main Street at Temple Street. As a result the Poundcake Hill buildings faced the newly aligned Spring Street until they were demolished.\n\nSouthwest corner of Temple and Broadway\nThe second location of the Los Angeles County Hall of Records, opened 1962.\nAdjacent to the south, mid-block, is a portion of Grand Park.\n\nFirst and Broadway\nNortheast corner of First and Broadway\nLos Angeles Times 1886 building.

The Orpheum has hosted performances by Jack Benny, Eddie Cantor, Sophie Tucker, Will Rogers, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, the Marx Brothers, and Lena Horne. In the 1990s, Tom Hanks used the Orpheum as a substitute for the Orpheum in Pittsburgh for his film That Thing You Do. The Orpheum has also been featured in the Guns N' Roses video, \"November Rain,\" and in the Sean Penn-produced video for Jewel's \"You Were Meant for Me\".

It was the showcase for movies from the United Artists group created in 1919 by Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks and D.W. Griffith. The theater was designed by C. Howard Crane, with Walker & Eisen, in a Gothic style inspired by a church in Segovia, Spain. The columns feature terra cotta capitals carved with film and theater themed grotesques. The interior includes a series of frescoes and murals by the firm of Anthony Heinsbergen. In 1990, the United Artists Theater was restored by Gene Scott's L.A. University Church; Scott called on his television flock to come to Los Angeles to help with the restoration. Scott's famous \"Jesus Saves\" sign was placed on the back side of the building to avoid interfering with the original facade. In 2013 the upper floors of the building were renovated into a boutique hotel, the Ace Los Angeles; the auditorium has been returned to use as a concert venue and theater.\n\nSouth of Olympic Boulevard (originally Tenth Street)\nWest side\nLos Angeles Examiner building, SW corner 11th\nAthens Park, 124th to El Segundo Blvd.\nSite of the Globe Department Store, 51st and Broadway\n\nEast side\nThe Hoxton hotel, 1060 S.

Discovery (WBD), CNN was the first television channel to provide 24-hour news coverage and the first all-news television channel in the United States.\nAs of December 2023, CNN had 68,974,000 television households as subscribers in the US According to Nielsen, down from 80 million in March 2021. In June 2021, CNN ranked third in viewership among cable news networks, behind Fox News and MSNBC, averaging 580,000 viewers throughout the day, down 49% from a year earlier, amid sharp declines in viewers across all cable news networks. While CNN ranked 14th among all basic cable networks in 2019, then jumped to 7th during a major surge for the three largest cable news networks (completing a rankings streak of Fox News at number 5 and MSNBC at number 6 for that year), it settled back to number 11 in 2021 and had further declined to number 21 in 2022.\nGlobally, CNN programming has aired through CNN International, seen by viewers in over 212 countries and territories. Since May 2019, however, the US domestic version has absorbed international news coverage in order to reduce programming costs. The American version, sometimes referred to as CNN (US), is also available in Canada, and some islands in the Caribbean. CNN also licenses its brand and content to other channels, such as CNN-News18 in India. In Japan it broadcasts CNNj which started in 2003, with simultaneous translation in Japanese.\n\nHistory\nThe Cable News Network launched at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on June 1, 1980. After an introduction by Ted Turner, the husband and wife team of David Walker and Lois Hart anchored the channel's first newscast. Burt Reinhardt, the executive vice president of CNN, hired most of the channel's first 200 employees, including the network's first news anchor, Bernard Shaw.\nSince its debut, CNN has expanded its reach to several cable and satellite television providers, websites, and specialized closed-circuit channels (such as CNN Airport). The company has 42 bureaus (12 domestic, 31 international), more than 900 affiliated local stations (which also receive news and features content via the video newswire service CNN Newsource), and several regional and foreign-language networks around the world. The channel's success made a bona-fide mogul of founder Ted Turner and set the stage for conglomerate Time Warner's (later WarnerMedia which merged with Discovery Inc. forming Warner Bros. Discovery) eventual acquisition of the Turner Broadcasting System in 1996.\n\nProgramming\nCurrent schedule\nCNN's current weekday schedule consists mostly of rolling news programming during daytime hours, followed by in-depth news and information programs during the evening and primetime hours. The network's morning programming consists of Early Start, an early-morning news program now hosted by Kasie Hunt at 5\u20136 a.m. ET. This is followed by CNN This Morning, the network's morning show, hosted by Poppy Harlow and Phil Mattingly, at 6\u20139 a.m. ET. Since April 2023, CNN News Central has served as the network's rolling news block on weekdays, with its morning edition from 9 a.m. to noon ET anchored by John Berman, Kate Bolduan, and Sara Sidner, and its afternoon edition from 1\u20134 p.m. ET anchored by Brianna Keilar and Boris Sanchez. In the noon hour is Inside Politics, hosted by Dana Bash.\nCNN's late afternoon and early evening lineup consists of The Lead with Jake Tapper at 4\u20135 p.m. ET and The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer at 5\u20137 p.m. ET. The network's evening and prime time lineup shifts towards more in-depth programming, including Erin Burnett OutFront at 7 p.m. ET, Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0 at 8 p.m. ET, and The Source with Kaitlan Collins at 9 p.m. ET. The 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. hours are filled by CNN Newsnight with Abby Phillip and Laura Coates Live respectively. From November 2023, the Wednesday edition of Newsnight has been replaced with King Charles, a limited-run late-night talk show helmed by Gayle King and Charles Barkley.\nThe network's weekend morning programming begins with CNN Newsroom (simulcast from CNN International) at 4\u20136 a.m. ET every Saturday and 3\u20136 a.m. ET every Sunday. CNN Newsroom also airs throughout the day between noon and 8 p.m. ET with hosts Fredricka Whitfield and Jim Acosta. Each weekend day from 6 a.m. ET, until 8 a.m. ET Saturday and 9 a.m. ET Sunday are the weekend editions of CNN This Morning, hosted by Amara Walker and Victor Blackwell. On Saturdays, First of All with Victor Blackwell airs at 8 a.m. ET, followed by Smerconish with Michael Smerconish at 9 a.m. ET, The Chris Wallace Show at 10 a.m. ET and The Amanpour Hour with Christine Amanpour at 11 a.m. ET. The Sunday morning lineup consists primarily of political talk shows, starting with State of the Union co-hosted by Jake Tapper and Dana Bash at 9 a.m. ET followed by the international affairs program Fareed Zakaria GPS at 10 a.m. ET and Inside Politics with Manu Raju at 11 a.m. ET.\nWeekend primetime, starting at 9 p.m. ET on Saturday and 8 p.m. ET on Sunday, is dedicated mostly to factual programming, such as documentary specials and miniseries like The Whole Story with Anderson Cooper. Documentary-style reality series, such as Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown and United Shades of America, and acquired documentary films presented under the banner CNN Films may also air during weekend primetime.\n\nPast programming\nFor the 2014\u201315 season, after canceling Piers Morgan Tonight (which, itself, replaced the long-running Larry King Live), CNN experimented with running factual and reality-style programming during the 9:00 p.m. ET hour, such as John Walsh's The Hunt, This Is Life with Lisa Ling, and Mike Rowe's Somebody's Gotta Do It. Then-president Jeff Zucker explained that this new lineup was intended to shift CNN away from a reliance on pundit-oriented programs, and attract younger demographics to the network. Zucker stated that the 9:00 p.m. hour could be pre-empted during major news events for expanded coverage. These changes coincided with the introduction of a new imaging campaign for the network, featuring the slogan \"Go there\". In May 2014, CNN premiered The Sixties, a documentary miniseries produced by Tom Hanks, and Gary Goetzman which chronicled the United States in the 1960s. Owing to its success, CNN commissioned follow-ups focusing on other decades. Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0 was expanded to run two hours long, from 8 pm to 10 pm.\nBy 2019, CNN had produced at least 35 original series. Alongside the Hanks\/Goetzman franchise (including the 2018 spin-off 1968), CNN has aired other documentary miniseries relating to news and U.S. policies, such as The Bush Years, and American Dynasties: The Kennedys\u2014which saw the highest ratings of any CNN original series premiere to-date, with 1.7 million viewers. Parts Unknown concluded after the 2018 suicide of its host Anthony Bourdain; CNN announced several new miniseries and docuseries for 2019, including American Style (a miniseries produced by the digital media company Vox Media), The Redemption Project with Van Jones, Chasing Life with Sanjay Gupta, Tricky Dick (a miniseries chronicling Richard Nixon), The Movies (a spin-off of the Hanks\/Goetzman decades miniseries), and Once in a Great City: Detroit 1962\u201364.\nWith the takeover of CNN by Chris Licht and Warner Bros. Discovery, it was announced in October 2022 that CNN would cut back on acquisitions and commissions from third-parties as a cost-cutting measure, but Licht stressed that \"longform content remains an important pillar of our programming\", while the network announced a slate for 2023 that would include commissions such as Giuliani: What Happened to America's Mayor?, United States of Scandal, and The 2010s.\n\nOn-air presentation\nCNN began broadcasting in the high-definition 1080i resolution format in September 2007. This format is now standard for CNN and is available on all major cable and satellite providers.\n\nCNN's political coverage in HD was first given mobility by the introduction of the CNN Election Express bus in October 2007. The Election Express vehicle, capable of five simultaneous HD feeds, was used for the channel's CNN-YouTube presidential debates and for presidential candidate interviews.\nIn December 2008, CNN introduced a comprehensive redesign of its on-air appearance, which replaced an existing style that had been used since 2004. On-air graphics took a rounded, flat look in a predominantly black, white, and red color scheme, and the introduction of a new box next to the CNN logo for displaying show logos and segment-specific graphics, rather than as a large banner above the lower third. The redesign also replaced the scrolling ticker with a static \"flipper\", which could either display a feed of news headlines (both manually inserted and taken from the RSS feeds of CNN.com), or \"topical\" details related to a story.\nCNN's next major redesign was introduced on January 10, 2011, replacing the dark, flat appearance of the 2008 look with a glossier, blue-and-white color scheme, moving the secondary logo box to the opposite end of the screen, and framing its graphics for the 16:9 aspect ratio (which is downscaled to a letterboxed format for standard definition feeds). On February 18, 2013, following Jeff Zucker's arrival as head of the network, the \"flipper\" was dropped and reverted to a scrolling ticker.\nOn August 11, 2014, CNN introduced a new graphics package, dropping the glossy appearance for a flat, rectangular scheme incorporating red, white, and black colors, and the Gotham typeface. The ticker alternated between general headlines and financial news from CNN Business, and the secondary logo box was replaced with a smaller box below the CNN bug, which displayed either the title, hashtag, or Twitter handle for the show being aired or its anchor. In April 2016, CNN began to introduce a new corporate typeface, known as \"CNN Sans\", across all of its platforms. Inspired by Helvetica Neue and commissioned after consultations with Troika Design Group, the font family consists of 30 different versions with varying weights and widths to facilitate use across print, television, and digital mediums. CNN International would also adopt these graphics, but with the CNN logo bug having a white on red color scheme to differentiate it from the domestic network.\nIn August 2016, CNN announced the launch of CNN Aerial Imagery and Reporting (CNN AIR), a drone-based news collecting operation to integrate aerial imagery and reporting across all CNN branches and platforms, along with Turner Broadcasting and Time Warner entities.\nOn June 1, 2023, CNN refreshed its graphics to mark the 43rd anniversary of its launch, using gradients and rounded corners, thinner fonts, and a modified layout that moved the show title to a secondary tab on the lower third next to the segment title, and replaced the ticker with a static \"flipper\" for the first time since 2013, among other changes. Amid poor internal reception to the redesign and the firing of Chris Licht as head of CNN, elements of the prior graphics began to be reinstated later that month, including the bolder typography previously used for lower third headlines. Further changes were made on August 14, 2023, with the return of the scrolling ticker and the show title box to make it closer resemble the 2014\u201323 graphics, but maintaining most of the other visual changes.\nOn June 27, 2024, CNN hosted the first presidential debate for former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden. CNN claimed that more people watched the CNN Presidential Debate than any other CNN program in history.\n\nStaff\nOn July 27, 2012, CNN president Jim Walton announced he was resigning after 30 years at the network. Walton remained with CNN until the end of that year. In January 2013, former NBCUniversal President Jeff Zucker replaced Walton.\nOn January 29, 2013, longtime political analysts James Carville and Mary Matalin, and fellow political contributor Erick Erickson were let go by CNN.\nIn February 2022, Zucker was asked to resign by Jason Kilar, the chief executive of CNN's owner WarnerMedia, after Zucker's relationship with one of his lieutenants was discovered during the investigation into former CNN primetime host Chris Cuomo's efforts to control potentially damaging reporting regarding his brother Andrew Cuomo, governor of New York. Kilar announced that the interim co-heads would be executive vice presidents Michael Bass, Amy Entelis, and Ken Jautz.  On February 26, 2022, it was announced that Chris Licht\u2014known for his work at MSNBC and CBS\u2014would be the next president of CNN; he was planned to be instated after the spin off and merger of WarnerMedia into Discovery Inc. Licht started his tenure in May 2022, and his tenure ended in June 2023.\nIn August 2023, it announced Mark Thompson, formerly of The New York Times, as its next CEO. In one of his first major moves, he kept the executive team under Chris Licht - the Quad composed of David Leavy, chief operating officer, and three executive vice presidents (Virginia Moseley for editorial, Amy Entelis for talent, and Eric Sherling for programming) - in place, but expanded their responsibilities. Moseley became the network's first executive editor and would have both national and international news. Adding their ranks, Thompson made Alex MacCallum, who worked with Thompson at The New York Times, executive vice president of digital products. In highlighting these moves, Thompson emphasized existing staff would need to get used to change. \nIn July 2024, CNN announced that it was cutting one hundred jobs, or about 3% of its total workforce. The company also announced that it was consolidating three newsrooms into one, namely, its U.S. news gathering, international news gathering and digital news gathering operations. CNN's global workforce, in July 2024, included roughly 3,500 people.\n\nOther platforms\nWebsite\nCNN launched its website, CNN.com (initially known as CNN Interactive), on August 30, 1995. The site attracted growing interest over its first decade and is now one of the most popular news websites in the world. The widespread growth of blogs, social media and user-generated content have influenced the site, and blogs, in particular, have focused CNN's previously scattershot online offerings, most noticeably in the development and launch of CNN Pipeline in late 2005.\nIn April 2009, CNN.com ranked third place among online global news sites in unique users in the U.S., according to Nielsen\/NetRatings; with an increase of 11% over the previous year.\nCNN Pipeline was the name of a paid subscription service, its corresponding website, and a content delivery client that provided streams of live video from up to four sources (or \"pipes\"), on-demand access to CNN stories and reports, and optional pop-up \"news alerts\" to computer users. The installable client was available to users of PCs running Microsoft Windows. There was also a browser-based \"web client\" that did not require installation. The service was discontinued in July 2007, and was replaced with a free streaming service.\nOn April 18, 2008, CNN.com was targeted by Chinese hackers in retaliation for the channel's coverage on the 2008 Tibetan unrest. CNN reported that they took preventive measures after news broke of the impending attack.\nThe company was honored at the 2008 Technology & Engineering Emmy Awards for development and implementation of an integrated and portable IP-based live, edit and store-and-forward digital news gathering (DNG) system. The first use of what would later win CNN this award was in April 2001 when CNN correspondent Lisa Rose Weaver covered, and was detained, for the release of the U.S. Navy crew of a damaged electronic surveillance plane after the Hainan Island incident. The technology consisted of a videophone produced by 7E Communications Ltd of London, UK. This DNG workflow is used today by the network to receive material worldwide using an Apple MacBook Pro, various prosumer and professional digital cameras, software from Streambox Inc., and BGAN terminals from Hughes Network Systems.\nOn October 24, 2009, CNN launched a new version of the CNN.com website; the revamped site included the addition of a new \"sign up\" option, in which users can create their own username and profile, and a new \"CNN Pulse\" (beta) feature, along with a new red color theme. However, most of the news stories archived on the website were deleted.\n\nBlogs\nThe topical news program Judy Woodruff's Inside Politics was the first CNN program to feature a round-up of blogs in 2005. Blog coverage was expanded when Inside Politics was folded into The Situation Room (Inside Politics later returned to CNN in 2014, this time hosted by the network's chief national correspondent John King.). In 2006, CNN launched CNN Exchange and CNN iReport, initiatives designed to further introduce and centralize the impact of everything from blogging to citizen journalism within the CNN brand. CNN iReport which features user-submitted photos and video, has achieved considerable traction, with increasingly professional-looking reports filed by amateur journalists, many still in high school or college. The iReport gained more prominence when observers of the Virginia Tech shootings sent in first-hand photos of what was going on during the shootings.\nIn April 2010, CNN announced via Twitter that it would launch a food blog called \"Eatocracy\", which will \"cover all news related to food \u2013 from recalls to health issues to culture\". CNN had an internet relay chat (IRC) network at chat.cnn.com. CNN placed a live chat with Benjamin Netanyahu on the network in 1998.\nCNNHealth consists of expert doctors answering viewers' questions online at CNN's \"The Chart\" blog website. Contributors include Sanjay Gupta (Chief Medical Correspondent), Charles Raison (Mental Health Expert), Otis Brawley (Conditions Expert), Melina Jampolis (Diet and Fitness Expert), Jennifer Shu (Living Well Expert), and Elizabeth Cohen (Senior Medical Correspondent).\n\nOther digital offerings\nIn early 2008, CNN began maintaining a live streaming broadcast available to cable and satellite subscribers who receive CNN at home (a precursor to the TV Everywhere services that would become popularized by cable and satellite providers beginning with Time Warner's incorporation of the medium). CNN International is broadcast live, as part of the RealNetworks SuperPass subscription service outside the U.S. CNN also offers several RSS feeds and podcasts.\nCNN also has multiple channels in the popular video-sharing site YouTube, but those videos can only be viewed in the United States, a source of criticism among YouTube users worldwide. In 2014, CNN launched a radio version of their television programming on TuneIn Radio. The network also hosts CNN-10, a daily 10-minute video show visible at the CNN website or YouTube. It replaced the long-running show CNN Student News which had been aired since 1989. It is aimed at a global audience of students, teachers, and adults, and was hosted by Carl Azuz. In fall of 2022, Carl Azuz was replaced by Coy Wire as the host of CNN 10, after leaving CNN due to a \"personal decision\" according to a CNN spokesperson in a newsletter published on September 18, 2022.\nOn March 7, 2017, CNN announced the official launch of its virtual reality unit named CNNVR. It will produce 360 videos to its Android and iOS apps within CNN Digital. It is planning to cover major news events with the online, and digital news team in New York City, Atlanta, London, Hong Kong, San Francisco, Dubai, Johannesburg, Tokyo, and Beijing.\n\nCNN Newsource is a subscription-based affiliation video service that provides CNN content to television station affiliates with CNN, including terrestrial stations and international stations. Newsource allows affiliates to download videos from CNN, as well as from other affiliates who upload their video to Newsource.\nCNN also maintains a wire service known as CNN Wire.\nCNN's digital storefront, which sells branded merchandise, household goods, and software, is operated by StackCommerce via partnership.\nIn 2021, CNN Digital had an average of 144 million unique visitors in the United States according to Comscore, making it the most viewed digital news outlet, ahead of The New York Times, NBC News, Fox News, The Washington Post.\n\nBeme\nOn November 28, 2016, CNN announced the acquisition of Beme for a reported $25 million. On November 29, 2016, Matt Hackett, co-founder of Beme, announced via an email to its users that the Beme app would be shutting down on January 31, 2017. Since the shutdown of the app, it was announced that CNN intended to use the current talent behind Beme to work on a separate start-up endeavor. Beme's current team will retain full creative control of the new project, which was slated to be released in the summer of 2017. Beme have also brought on other internet stars such as the host of Vsauce 3, Jake Roper, as head of production, who features prominently in Beme co-founder Casey Neistat's vlogs. Beme News has since begun uploading news related video on YouTube.\n\nFilms\nIn October 2012, CNN formed a film division called CNN Films to distribute and produce made-for-TV and feature documentaries. Its first acquisition was a documentary entitled Girl Rising, a documentary narrated by Meryl Streep that focused on the struggles of girls' education.\n\nRadio\nIn July 2014, Cumulus Media announced that it would end its partnership with ABC News Radio, and enter into a new partnership with CNN to syndicate national and international news content for its stations through Westwood One beginning in 2015, including access to a wire service, and digital content for its station websites. This service is unbranded, allowing individual stations to integrate the content with their news brands.\nAs of February 2019, the audio simulcast of CNN is distributed on Entercom's Radio.com website and app.\n\nSpecialized channels\nOver the years, CNN has launched spin-off networks in the United States and other countries.

One study measured airtime of guests on major news networks between 2010 and 2021 and compared that to the guests' campaign donations.  It found guests on CNN to have a liberal bias (a \"campaign finance score\" of \u22129.7, where 0 is equal airtime, compared to \u221214.1 for MSNBC and 49.8 for Fox News), which became more pronounced during the Trump administration.

The \u201cCahuenga\u201d name is a Spanish, phonetic derivative with no actual Spanish language meaning that is attributed to the Tongva village of Kawengna, meaning \"place of the mountain\". It connects Sunset Boulevard in the heart of old Hollywood to the Hollywood Hills and North Hollywood in the San Fernando Valley.\n\nDescription\nCahuenga Boulevard begins at West Victory Boulevard in North Hollywood, crosses the Ventura Freeway and the Los Angeles River as it temporarily merges with Lankershim Boulevard before passing the Campo de Cahuenga and Universal City Metro station, then crosses the Hollywood Freeway. At this point an intersection is formed with Ventura Boulevard to the northwest and the continuation of Cahuenga Boulevard to the southeast. From here it parallels the Hollywood Freeway, passing The Baked Potato jazz club.\nand Universal Studios Hollywood (as Cahuenga Boulevard West), rising over the Cahuenga Pass connecting the San Fernando Valley to the Los Angeles Basin. Crossing the freeway once again on the Pilgrimage Bridge near The Hollywood Bowl, it continues (as North Cahuenga Boulevard) down to Sunset Boulevard and Melrose Avenue in downtown Hollywood. The boulevard is one of the principal routes to Universal Studios from downtown Los Angeles.\n\nLandmarks\nThe southern part of Cahuenga Boulevard has been referred to as the \"heart of old Hollywood\". The intersection between Cahuenga and Hollywood Boulevards had been an important intersection from the early history of Los Angeles, and by 1915 it already had a trolley stop, a bank and a hardware store. Trolley cars were used on the boulevards until the 1960s when replaced with bus. Historically a number of important Los Angeles buildings were located on the road including the Technicolor building from the 1940s through the 1960s and the World Book and News building. The Owl Drug Company at 6380\u201384 Hollywood Boulevard on the south-west corner of Cahuenga Boulevard was a notable Californian company in the 1930s. At the intersection of Cahuenga Boulevard with Yucca Street, just off of Hollywood Boulevard was the Halifax Hotel, owned by world-famous classical pianist Van Cliburn.\nThe Buster Keaton studio, originally belonging to Charlie Chaplin, was located on Lillian Way, one block east of the boulevard. The boulevard appears in several of his films. 1542 Cahuenga Boulevard, which formerly adjoined the Toribuchi Grocery at 1546, appeared in the 1921 Keaton film The Goat, which featured Keaton running from the police past them. It is now a strip mall. In another Keaton film, Three Ages (1923), Keaton is seen running from the police past the Los Angeles Police Department Hollywood building and former fire station, now the location of Edmonds Tower at 1629.\n\nToday, numerous nightclubs, bars, and restaurants are dotted along the boulevard south of Franklin Avenue. Notable clubs on Cahuenga include The Room, Hotel Caf\u00e9, Velvet Margarita, and many others.  The Hotel Caf\u00e9, at 1623 1\/2 N. Cahuenga Blvd, is owned by Marko Shafer and Maximillian Mamikunian and opened in 2000. The Baked Potato, one of the city's most prominent jazz clubs, is situated near the intersection with the Hollywood Freeway, and the Hollywood Theatre of Note is also on the boulevard. At 1355 North Cahuenga Boulevard is the Los Angeles Fire Department Museum and Memorial, a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument and National Register of Historic Places building which was built in the Neo-Renaissance style in 1930.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nBuilders Of The Broad Highway Film showing Cahuenga Parkway c1940 construction (~4:22 onwards)\nLAistory: Pilgrimage Bridge Cahuenga Parkway completion details","40":"The California Digital Newspaper Collection (CDNC) is a freely-available, archive of digitized California newspapers; it is accessible through the project's website.  The collection contains over six million pages from over forty-two million articles.  The project is part of the Center for Bibliographical Studies and Research (CBSR) at the University of California Riverside.\n\nHistory\nThe Center for Bibliographical Studies and Research was one of six initial participants in the National Digital Newspaper Program (NDNP), a newspaper digitization project established from a partnership between the Library of Congress and the National Endowment for the Humanities.  Between 2005 and 2011, the CBSR received three two-year grants, and contributed around 300,000 pages to Chronicling America, the public face of the NDNP.  Published newspaper titles submitted include the San Francisco Call, Los Angeles Daily Herald, Amador Ledger, and the Imperial Valley Press.  In 2015, the CBSR received a fourth grant from the National Digital Newspaper Project.  Between 2015 and 2017, the project contributed another 100,000 pages from the Gold Rush era, as well as foreign-language newspapers.\nThe California Digital Newspaper Collection was officially launched in 2007, and contained the initial 100,000 pages produced for the National Digital Newspaper Project from 2005 to 2007.  Another 50,000 pages were created, with support from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, under the provisions of the Library Services and Technology Act, (LSTA), administered in California by the State Librarian.  All content contributed to NDNP is also hosted in the CDNC, with important differences, noted below in Digitization.  Between 2007 and 2013, the CDNC digitized roughly 300,000 pages through the LSTA program, administered by the California State Library.  In 2014, the project announced a five-year plan, supported by LSTA, to digitize one title per county, up through 1923.\nIn 2010, the CDNC initiated the \"Born Digital Project\", with the goal to collect and host contemporary PDFs from newspaper publishers.  Roughly a dozen publishers have or do participate in the project.  See California Digital Newspaper Collection for more information.\nAs of 2023 the site gets 140,000 unique monthly visitors from academics, amateur historians, genealogists, schoolteachers, et al.\n\nDigitization\nThe California Digital Newspaper Collection follows standards established by the National Digital Newspaper Program. Microfilm or newsprint is scanned to create TIFF images; whenever possible, master negative film is used.  The CBSR manages an archive of approximately 100,000 reels of negative film.  These are stored and maintained by the California Newspaper Microfilm Archive.  When negative film is unavailable positive can be used, but image quality and OCR will not be as good.\nThe TIFF images are then processed or \"digitized\" to create derivative files, including a JP2, PDF, and METS\/ALTO XML for each page.\nUnlike NDNP, the CDNC has traditionally digitized to article-level rather than just page-level.  Individual \"segments\" on a page\u2014articles, illustrations, advertisements, etc.\u2014are identified during digitization and can be retrieved by the researcher.  For an illustration of the difference between page- and article-level, compare the San Francisco Call in the CDNC to the same title in Chronicling America.\nRecently the CDNC has begun digitizing some titles to page-level, but most are still article-level.  The main advantage of page-level is lower cost when done in an automated fashion, without human input.\n\nPapers covered\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website","41":"The California Incline is a slanted road in Santa Monica, California, connecting Ocean Avenue with State Route 1 (Pacific Coast Highway or PCH). It technically is the last link, the western end of California Avenue, a major east\u2013west street in Santa Monica.\n\nHistory and overview\nThe California Incline was originally a walkway known as Sunset Trail, which was cut through the bluffs to provide beach access to pedestrians in 1896. A roadway structure 1,400 feet (430 m) in length was built in 1932. It is a vital street in Santa Monica, linking the PCH with Ocean Avenue and California Avenue, bisecting Palisades Park. It begins at an intersection with Ocean Avenue and California Avenue, at the top of the Palisades, extending to the PCH at the base of the bluffs.\n\n2015\u201316 reconstruction\nThe California Incline was identified as structurally deficient in the early 1990s. In 2007, the City of Santa Monica secured federal highway funds to replace the structure with one meeting current seismic standards. The new bridge consists of a pile-supported reinforced concrete slab structure with a width of 51 feet 8 inches (15.75 m), an increase of 5 feet 8 inches (1.73 m) over the previous structure. The project cost $17 million, with 88.5% coming from federal funds and the balance from local funds. Construction began in April 2015 and took 17 months to complete. The roadway reopened to the public on September 1, 2016. The rebuilt structure includes wider sidewalks and bicycle lanes.\n\nPopular culture\nThe California Incline has been featured in various films, including It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963) and Knocked Up (2007).  It was also featured in the hardboiled crime novel, In a Lonely Place (1942), written by Dorothy B. Hughes. It was also portrayed in some video games including Street Racing Syndicate, Midnight Club II Midnight Club: LA (and its Remix version) and Grand Theft Auto V.\n\nSee also\nMcClure Tunnel\n\n\n== References ==","42":"Route 110, consisting of State Route 110 (SR 110) and Interstate 110 (I-110), is a state and auxiliary Interstate Highway in the Los Angeles metropolitan area of the US state of California. The entire route connects San Pedro and the Port of Los Angeles with Downtown Los Angeles and Pasadena. The southern segment from San Pedro to I-10 in downtown Los Angeles is signed as I-110, while the northern segment to Pasadena is signed as SR 110. The entire length of I-110, as well as SR 110 south of the Four Level Interchange with US Route 101 (US 101), is the Harbor Freeway, and SR 110 north from US 101 to Pasadena is the historic Arroyo Seco Parkway, the first freeway in the western United States.\n\nRoute description\nRoute 110 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration.\n\nHarbor Freeway\nThe Harbor Freeway, signed as I-110, begins at Gaffey Street in San Pedro, where it then travels mostly due north to the Santa Monica Freeway (I-10) at a point south of downtown Los Angeles, where it becomes signed as SR 110. I-110 is primarily within the city limits of Los Angeles, running right along the South Los Angeles region and the Harbor Gateway, a two-mile (3.2 km) wide north\u2013south corridor that was annexed by the city of Los Angeles specifically to connect San Pedro, Wilmington, and the Port of Los Angeles with the rest the city.\nNorth of I-10, the freeway continues as SR 110 through Downtown Los Angeles to its junction with US 101 at the Four Level Interchange.\nThe Harbor Freeway, along with the Long Beach Freeway (I-710), are the principal means for freight from the Port of Los Angeles to railyards and warehouses further inland. Its interchange with the Santa Monica Freeway is notoriously busy and congested, and the portions bordering Bunker Hill in northwest Downtown Los Angeles are choked with traffic at peak travel times.\n\nLandmarks\nNotable landmarks and attractions near the Harbor Freeway include the Los Angeles Harbor College,  California State University, Dominguez Hills, Watts Towers, Exposition Park (including the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the BMO Stadium and the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art), the University of Southern California, Crypto.com Arena, L.A. Live, Los Angeles Convention Center, the skyline of Downtown Los Angeles; and Chinatown.\nThe Harbor Freeway is noted for its elaborate high-occupancy toll lane feature, with the HOT lanes elevated above the rest of traffic in many areas, constructed in 1994 by C.C. Myers, Inc. as HOV lanes and converted to HOT lanes in 2012. Of particular note is the Judge Harry Pregerson Interchange, which contains the most elaborate network of direct HOV\/HOT connectors in Los Angeles County. It includes a seven-story ramp that connects the Century Freeway's HOV lanes to the Harbor Freeway's northbound HOT lanes and offers splendid views of the entire Los Angeles Basin and the San Gabriel Mountains. The interchange with SR 91 (formally known as the Edmond J. Russ Interchange) is also fairly large.\n\nArroyo Seco Parkway\nSR 110 continues north as the Arroyo Seco Parkway from US 101 to Pasadena. From downtown, it passes through Elysian Park, where the northbound lanes pass through the four Figueroa Street Tunnels and the higher southbound lanes pass through a cut and over low areas on bridges. Then after crossing the Los Angeles River and the Golden State Freeway (I-5), the parkway runs alongside the Arroyo Seco seasonal river towards Pasadena.\n\nHarbor Transitway\nThe Harbor Transitway is a grade-separated, shared-use express bus and high-occupancy toll (HOT) corridor, running in the median of I-110, between SR 91 (Gardena Freeway) and Adams Boulevard in the south side of Downtown Los Angeles. Southbound buses exit the HOT lanes at dedicated ramps connecting to the Harbor Gateway Transit Center. Each vehicle using the HOT lanes is required to carry a FasTrak Flex transponder, with its switch set to indicate the number of the vehicle's occupants (1, 2, or 3 or more), regardless of whether they qualify for free.\n\nHistory\nIn the 1924 Major Street Traffic Plan for Los Angeles, a widening of Figueroa Street to San Pedro as a good road to the Port of Los Angeles was proposed. Progress was slow, and, in 1933, the state legislature added the entire length to the state highway system as Route 165, an unsigned designation. This route not only extended from San Pedro north to Los Angeles, but continued through the city-built Figueroa Street Tunnels and along the northern extension of Figueroa Street to Eagle Rock, and then followed Linda Vista Avenue (via an overlap on Route 161 (SR 134) over the Colorado Street Bridge) to Route 9 (now I-210) at the Devil's Gate Reservoir. The entire length of Route 165 became Sign Route 11 in 1934. US Route 6 was also assigned to the portion between SR 1 and Avenue 26 in 1937, and, at about the same time, US 66 was moved from Eagle Rock Boulevard to Figueroa Street, overlapping SR 11 between Sunset Boulevard (US 101) and Colorado Street (SR 134).\nThe state completed the Arroyo Seco Parkway which had been added to the state highway system in 1935 as Route 205, in early 1941, providing a faster route between SR 11 at Avenue 26 and Pasadena. US 66 was moved to the new route, while SR 11 remained on Figueroa Street and Linda Vista Avenue, the former also becoming a new US Route 66 Alternate. Construction of a freeway to San Pedro was much slower, despite having been in the earliest plans for an integrated system. Initially, the Harbor Parkway was to split at the merge with the Venice Parkway northeast of the University of Southern California, with the East By-Pass and West By-Pass straddling the Los Angeles Central Business District and rejoining at the split between the Arroyo Seco Parkway and Riverside Parkway south of Dodger Stadium. The West By-Pass was soon incorporated into the Harbor Parkway, and the first short piece, by then renamed the Harbor Freeway, opened on July 30, 1952, from the Four Level Interchange south to 3rd Street. (The Arroyo Seco Parkway was completed to the Four Level Interchange on September 22, 1953, and renamed the Pasadena Freeway on November 16, 1954.)\nThe Harbor Freeway gradually pushed south, opening to Olympic Boulevard on March 23, 1954, and Washington Boulevard on May 14, 1954. On March 27, 1956, the highway was extended to 42nd Street, and on April 24, 1957, it reached temporary ramps at 88th Place. Further extensions were made to Century Boulevard on July 31, 1958, 124th Street on September 24, 1958, Alondra Boulevard (which the county widened to carry the load) on May 2, 1960, 190th Street on July 15, 1960, Torrance Boulevard on August 28, 1962, and finally Pacific Coast Highway (SR 1) on September 26, 1962. There it connected with a section that had been open since June 19, 1956, from Pacific Coast Highway south to Channel Street. Along with the Vincent Thomas Bridge to Terminal Island, the final piece in San Pedro opened on July 9, 1970, completing the Harbor Freeway to its present length.\nIn December 1978, the Harbor Freeway was approved as an Interstate Highway by the FHWA. In 1981, the SR 11 designation was renumbered as I-110 on the Harbor Freeway, and SR 110 on the Pasadena Freeway. The I-110 designation had been previously applied to what is now a spur of I-10 from 1958 to 1968.\n\nRichard Ankrom signage\nIn 2001, Richard Ankrom, a local artist who got lost trying to get onto I-5 North from northbound I-110 because there was no clear official signage labeling access to I-5 North, solved his frustration by covertly modifying one of the overhead signs on the freeway just before the Four Level Interchange (34.055759\u00b0N 118.256181\u00b0W\ufeff \/ 34.055759; -118.256181). Using official government sign specifications, Ankrom fabricated two sign pieces, one being an I-5 marker shield and the other with the word \"NORTH\", and affixed them to the left side of the sign. He performed his modifications in broad daylight, disguised as a Caltrans worker. In that district, Caltrans has three sign crews, each thinking one of the other two crews did the installation. After nine months, at Ankrom's request, the Los Angeles Downtown News broke the story.\nPrior to Ankrom's work, the only signage directing motorists to the I-5 North off-ramp came at a quarter-mile (0.4 km) before the exit, thus forcing many to merge across multiple lanes in a very short distance. The signs were inspected by Caltrans to ensure they would not fall off onto the road below. Ankrom was never charged, despite statements from officials that his actions were illegal. Ankrom referred to his sign project as \"Guerilla Public Service\".\nCaltrans later added an additional \"5 North\" sign over the left northbound lane at the entrance to the Figueroa Street Tunnels, as well as new electric signage, which will note when an additional lane is available for those wishing to transition to northbound I-5 (converting the current single lane transition to dual lanes).\nIn 2009, Caltrans replaced all signage along this segment with newer, more reflective versions. These new signs include Ankrom's original improvements.\n\nPreservation\nDespite the increased traffic in Los Angeles, including trucks shipping products from the Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro, there are no plans to upgrade the rest of I-110 from I-10 to Pasadena to Interstate standards. Instead, Caltrans has pushed for a protected status alternative to preserve the Arroyo Seco Parkway as a historic landmark. The state legislature designated the original section, north of the Figueroa Street Viaduct, as a \"California Historic Parkway\" (part of the State Scenic Highway System reserved for freeways built before 1945) in 1993; the only other highway so designated is the Cabrillo Freeway (SR 163) in San Diego. The American Society of Civil Engineers named it a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1999, and it became a National Scenic Byway in 2002.\n\nExit list\nThe entire route is in Los Angeles County.\n\nSee also\nCalifornia Roads portal\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nCaltrans: I-110 highway conditions\nCaltrans Traffic Conditions Map\nCalifornia Highway Patrol Traffic Incidents\nMetro ExpressLanes \u2013 includes toll information on the I-110 Express Lanes\nA written account of Richard Ankrom's sign modification\nAnkrom's Web page about the signs\nCalifornia Highways - Interstate 110\nHarbor Freeway @ Asphaltplanet.ca\nCalifornia @ AARoads.com - Interstate 110 and California 110","43":"State Route 19 (SR 19) is a state highway in the U.S. state of California, running along \nLakewood Boulevard and Rosemead Boulevard in the Los Angeles area. An additional \"hidden\" state highway, State Route 164 (SR 164), is also signed as part of SR 19, despite having a legal description separate from Route 19. The combined route is a north\u2013south four-to-six lane suburban roadway, lying east of the Long Beach Freeway (Interstate 710) and west of the San Gabriel River Freeway (Interstate 605), and connecting the eastern parts of Long Beach and Pasadena via the Whittier Narrows. Under their legal descriptions, SR 19 runs north to Gallatin Road in Pico Rivera, then SR 164 goes from Gallatin Road to Pasadena. Since 1998, several pieces have been relinquished to local governments, and more transfers are authorized by state law.\n\nRoute description\nLocals generally refer to the combined SR 19\/164 route as either Lakewood Boulevard or Rosemead Boulevard, not by its numerical designation. The two highways are part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration.\nThe original official southern terminus of SR 19 was at the Los Alamitos Circle in Long Beach, where Lakewood Boulevard, State Route 1 (Pacific Coast Highway), and Los Coyotes Diagonal converge. SR 19 then proceeded north along Lakewood Boulevard through Long Beach and the City of Lakewood, intersecting with Interstate 405, passing under a runway of the Long Beach Airport (the part through the airport has been relocated to the east; parts of the old alignment remain as airport service roads), then running to the west of Lakewood Center Mall before passing through the neighborhood of Mayfair.\nSince the California Legislature relinquished segments of the highway, state control of SR 19 now officially begins at the point where Lakewood Boulevard crosses the Lakewood\u2013Bellflower city limits at Rose Street (SR 19 in Bellflower is also planned to be relinquished by the state). SR 19 then intersects State Route 91 before straddling the city border between Bellflower and Paramount and later Bellflower and Downey. State control of SR 19 then ends north of Gardendale Street when Lakewood Boulevard fully enters into Downey.\nLakewood Boulevard continues north through Downey, intersecting with Interstate 105 before passing by the large site formerly occupied by North American Aviation, Rockwell International and Boeing Reusable Space Systems and interchanging with Interstate 5. At Telegraph Road at the Downey-Pico Rivera city limits, Lakewood Boulevard turns into Rosemead Boulevard. Rosemead Boulevard continues north through Pico Rivera (where this segment of SR 19 has been relinquished to the city as well) to Gallatin Road.\nThe hidden SR 164, but signed as part of SR 19, begins north of Gallatin Road, traveling along Rosemead Boulevard across Whittier Narrows Dam before entering the Whittier Narrows Recreation Area and intersecting with State Route 60. After this, the road enters South El Monte before crossing the Rio Hondo and straddling the city boundary between Rosemead and El Monte. It then intersects with Interstate 10. This portion of Rosemead Boulevard between Gallatin Road and Interstate 10 is still maintained by the state and built to expressway standards.\nState maintenance ends again at the Rosemead\u2013Temple City city limits near Grand Avenue. Rosemead Boulevard then continues north through Temple City and the unincorporated areas of East San Gabriel and East Pasadena and into the City of Pasadena. (The highway was relinquished to Temple City, and those portions in the unincorporated areas were transferred to Los Angeles County.) In Pasadena, the state still maintains the short portion of Rosemead Boulevard from Interstate 210 to Foothill Boulevard, with SR 164's legal northern terminus at the latter. Rosemead Boulevard continues northwest under Pasadena's control from Foothill Boulevard to Sierra Madre Villa Avenue.\nBus service is provided by Metro Local line 266 (between Foothill Boulevard and Del Amo Boulevard) and Long Beach Transit line 111 (south of Del Amo Boulevard) throughout Rosemead Boulevard and Lakewood Boulevard.  The Metro C Line is also provided by a station in the median of Interstate 105 under Lakewood Boulevard.\n\nHistory\nBefore the present SR 19 was constructed, San Gabriel Boulevard, which extended from Lamanda Park south to Downey, and was widened and repaved by an assessment tax in 1925, was the main road through the Whittier Narrows, requiring several turns to stay on it and to continue south to Long Beach. The state legislature added Route 168 to the state highway system in 1933, which followed this general alignment between Route 60 (SR 1) in Long Beach and Route 9 (Foothill Boulevard, then US 66) near Lamanda Park. SR 19 was later designated out of the 1964 state highway renumbering.\n\nThe 9.56-mile (15.39 km) piece of SR 19 north of Gallatin Road in Pico Rivera has legally been State Route 164 since the 1964 renumbering, but has always been signed as SR 19. Original plans for SR 164 took it southeast to Interstate 605 from the present transition between SR 164 and SR 19, and it was originally planned as the Rio Hondo Freeway.\nMany segments of SR 19 have since been relinquished to the cities that they run through. Caltrans relinquished Long Beach's portion of SR 19 to the city on January 27, 1999, and Downey's segment of SR 19 was relinquished to the city on July 3, 2001. However, the segment in Pico Rivera was not relinquished to that city until June 22, 2004. On October 27, 2006, the northern portion of SR 164 that went through an unincorporated area of the county from Callita Street to I-210 was relinquished to the county.  In April 2008, the section of SR 164 through Temple City was relinquished to that city. On April 9, 2012, the section of SR 19 through Lakewood was relinquished to that city. In 2017, the relinquishment process in Bellflower has started.\n\nMajor intersections\nExcept where prefixed with a letter, postmiles were measured on the road as it was in 1964, based on the alignment that existed at the time, and do not necessarily reflect current mileage. R reflects a realignment in the route since then, M indicates a second realignment, L refers to an overlap due to a correction or change, and T indicates postmiles classified as temporary (for a full list of prefixes, see California postmile \u00a7 Official postmile definitions). Segments that remain unconstructed or have been relinquished to local control may be omitted. The entire route is in Los Angeles County.\n\nSee also\nList of streets in the San Gabriel Valley\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nCaltrans: State Route 19 highway conditions\nCaltrans Traffic Conditions Map\nCalifornia Highway Patrol Traffic Incidents\nCalifornia @ AARoads.com - State Route 19\nCalifornia Highways: SR 19","44":"State Route 1 (SR 1) is a major north\u2013south state highway that runs along most of the Pacific coastline of the U.S. state of California. At 656 miles (1,056 km), it is the longest state route in California, and the second-longest in the US after Montana Highway 200. SR 1 has several portions designated as either Pacific Coast Highway (PCH), Cabrillo Highway, Shoreline Highway, or Coast Highway. Its southern terminus is at Interstate 5 (I-5) near Dana Point in Orange County and its northern terminus is at U.S. Route 101 (US 101) near Leggett in Mendocino County. SR 1 also at times runs concurrently with US 101, most notably through a 54-mile  (87 km) stretch in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, and across the Golden Gate Bridge.\nThe highway is designated as an All-American Road. In addition to providing a scenic route to numerous attractions along the coast, the route also serves as a major thoroughfare in the Greater Los Angeles Area, the San Francisco Bay Area, and several other coastal urban areas.\nSR 1 was built piecemeal in various stages, with the first section opening in the Big Sur region in the 1930s. However, portions of the route had several names and numbers over the years as more segments opened. It was not until the 1964 state highway renumbering that the entire route was officially designated as SR 1. Although SR 1 is a popular route for its scenery, frequent landslides and erosion along the coast have caused several segments to be either closed for lengthy periods for repairs, or re-routed inland.\n\nRoute description\nSR 1 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and through the Los Angeles metro area, Monterey, Santa Cruz, and San Francisco metro area is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. The California State Legislature has also relinquished state control of segments within Dana Point, Newport Beach, Santa Monica, and Oxnard; those segments are now maintained by those respective municipalities.\nThe Big Sur section from San Luis Obispo to Carmel is an official National Scenic Byway. SR 1 is eligible to be included in the State Scenic Highway System; however, only a few stretches between Los Angeles and San Francisco have officially been designated as a scenic highway, meaning that there are substantial sections of highway passing through a \"memorable landscape\" with no \"visual intrusions\", where the potential designation has gained popular favor with the community.\nThe entire route is designated as a Blue Star Memorial Highway to recognize those in the United States armed forces; this designation is sponsored by the California Garden Clubs, but the organization has not erected such markers along SR 1 yet. In 1959, the legislature officially designated the segment in Southern California between Interstate 5 (I-5) in Dana Point and US 101 near Oxnard as the Pacific Coast Highway (commonly referred to as \"PCH\", without the definite article \"the\", unlike other freeway numbers in the Los Angeles area). Between US 101 at the Las Cruces junction (8 miles [13 km] south of Buellton) and US 101 in Pismo Beach, and between US 101 in San Luis Obispo and Interstate 280 in San Francisco, the legislature also designated SR 1 as the Cabrillo Highway in 1959, after the explorer Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo who sailed along the coast line. The legislature also designated the route as the Shoreline Highway in 1957 between the Manzanita Junction near Marin City and Leggett. Smaller segments of the highway have been assigned several other names by the state and municipal governments.\nFor the most part, SR 1 runs parallel to the coastline, or close to it, but does turn several miles inland at various locations to avoid several federally controlled or protected areas such as Vandenberg Space Force Base, Diablo Canyon Power Plant and Point Reyes National Seashore. In addition to connecting the coastal cities and communities along its path, the route provides access to beaches, parks, and other attractions along the coast, making it a popular route for tourists. The route annually helps bring several billion dollars to the state's tourism industry. Segments of SR 1 range from urban freeway to simple rural two-lane road. Under the California Coastal Act, those segments of the highway that run through the rural areas of the protected California Coastal Zone may not be widened beyond a scenic two-lane road.\n\nOrange County\nAt its southernmost end in Orange County, SR 1 terminates at I-5 in Capistrano Beach in Dana Point. It then travels west into the city center. After leaving Dana Point, Pacific Coast Highway (PCH) becomes simply \"Coast Highway\" while at the same time continuing northwest along the coast through Laguna Beach (where it meets the southern terminus of SR 133) and Crystal Cove State Park.\nSR 1 then enters Newport Beach and passes through several affluent neighborhoods, including Newport Coast and Corona Del Mar, spans the entrance to the Upper Newport Bay, which marks the boundary between East Coast Highway and West Coast Highway, and crosses California State Route 55 near its southern terminus. Upon crossing the Santa Ana River mouth and entering Huntington Beach, SR 1 regains the Pacific Coast Highway designation. It passes Huntington State Beach and the southern terminus of California State Route 39 before reaching Bolsa Chica State Beach and the Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve. PCH then continues along the coast into Seal Beach, the final city on its journey in Orange County.\n\nLos Angeles and Ventura counties\nPCH enters Los Angeles County and the city of Long Beach after crossing the San Gabriel River. SR 1 then continues northwest through the city to its junction with Lakewood Boulevard (State Route 19) and Los Coyotes Diagonal at the Los Alamitos Circle, more than 2 miles (3.2 km) from the coast. From the traffic circle, it continues inland west through Long Beach, including approximately one mile adjacent to the southern boundary of Signal Hill. PCH is marked as such in Long Beach, but originally bore the name of Hathaway Avenue east of the traffic circle and State Street west of there. PCH then passes through the Los Angeles districts of Wilmington and Harbor City. While bypassing the immediate coastline of Palos Verdes, SR 1 continues to head west into the cities of Lomita and Torrance along the route of the former Redondo-Wilmington Boulevard.\nPCH then turns north through Redondo Beach and Hermosa Beach. Upon entering Manhattan Beach, it becomes Sepulveda Boulevard and turns back into PCH designation through El Segundo. At Imperial Highway, it regains the name Sepulveda Boulevard as it descends and passes under two runways of Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) via the Sepulveda Boulevard Tunnel.\n\nAfter leaving LAX, SR 1 splits from Sepulveda and turns northwest, becoming Lincoln Boulevard and passing through the Los Angeles neighborhoods of Westchester, Playa Vista, and Venice, as well as the unincorporated community of Marina Del Rey. This portion of SR 1 suffers heavy congestion at most times due to the shortage of alternate north-south arterial roads west of Interstate 405.  It then enters the city of Santa Monica, where SR 1 turns southwest, merging onto the westernmost segment of the Santa Monica Freeway. Passing through the McClure Tunnel (which also serves as the national western terminus of Interstate 10), SR 1 emerges along the beachfront in Santa Monica as PCH again and continues along the coast, separated from Downtown Santa Monica by the palisades north of Santa Monica Pier; this portion is also known locally as Palisades Beach Road and formerly as Roosevelt Highway. Upon leaving Santa Monica, PCH continues to follow the coast, curving west through the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles before becoming the main thoroughfare of the city of Malibu while traversing the entire 21 miles (34 km) of that city.\n\nSR 1 crosses the county line and continues through the Ventura County portion of the Malibu coast through Leo Carrillo State Park and Point Mugu State Park. After passing through a notch in the promontory that marks Point Mugu, the western end of the Santa Monica Mountains, and the beginning of the Oxnard Plain. The road cut left a very large rock formation at the tip of the point that is called the Mugu Rock. At that point, PCH leaves the coast and heads north, and then northwest as a freeway along the northeastern boundary of Naval Base Ventura County Point Mugu for several miles to an interchange at Rice Avenue, Pleasant Valley Road, and Oxnard Boulevard in Oxnard. The reconstructed interchange at Rice Avenue and Pleasant Valley Road channels traffic north on the surface street, Rice Avenue, towards the interchange with US 101. The historic route along Oxnard Boulevard was relinquished in 2014. Truck traffic to and from the Port of Hueneme also uses this designated route at the Rice Avenue\/Hueneme Road connector to connect with Route 101 at the Rice Avenue Interchange.\nAfter traveling through Ventura, SR 1 separates from US 101 to travel the historic beach route along the Rincon coast that was originally opened up by the construction of the Railroad Coastal Route from Emma Wood State Beach to the Mobil Pier Undercrossing near Sea Cliff, where it rejoins US 101 about 3 miles (4.8 km) south of the Santa Barbara County line near La Conchita.\n\nCentral Coast\nThe US 101\/SR 1 concurrency (although actual signage mentioning SR 1 through this segment is nonexistent) from the Mobil Pier Undercrossing runs for 54 miles (87 km), passing through the City of Santa Barbara and its neighboring communities along the coast of Santa Barbara County. The route then turns away from the Gaviota Coast at Gaviota State Beach, avoiding Point Conception, and heads due north through Gaviota State Park and the Gaviota Tunnel. In Las Cruces, SR 1, now named Cabrillo Highway, splits again from US 101 and heads northwest to the city of Lompoc. It is briefly joined with SR 246 along Lompoc's east-west Ocean Avenue, before turning north as H Street to Harris Grade Road, where it then regains the Cabrillo Highway name.\nAfter reaching the main entrance to Vandenberg Space Force Base, SR 1 turns northeast, away from the immediate coastline of the base, to join SR 135. Route 135 then splits from Route 1 south of Orcutt, and the Cabrillo Highway turns northwest back towards the coast to Guadalupe. It enters San Luis Obispo County, avoiding the immediate coastline of the protected Guadalupe-Nipomo Dunes, before passing through Grover Beach and subsequently joining US 101 for the third time at Pismo Beach. The US 101\/SR 1 concurrency then avoids the immediate coastline of Avila Beach and Diablo Canyon Power Plant, and instead heads straight inland to San Luis Obispo.\nSR 1 splits from US 101 at Santa Rosa Street in San Luis Obispo and then resumes as a four lane road as the Cabrillo Highway. It rejoins the coast in Morro Bay, running through that city as a freeway, where it crosses Morro Creek at the site of a prehistoric Chumash settlement dating to the Millingstone Horizon. From there, SR 1 proceeds north to Cayucos until it again becomes a winding, two lane road with occasional passing lanes. It then continues along the coast through Cambria and San Simeon, and past the elephant seal colony at Piedras Blancas Light Station. SR 1 provides access to Hearst Castle in San Simeon in Northern San Luis Obispo County.\n\nBig Sur\nSR 1 then enters the Big Sur region, crossing San Carp\u00f3foro Creek just south of the Monterey County line. For about 72 miles (116 km) from San Carp\u00f3foro Creek to Malpaso Creek, the road winds and hugs the cliffs of Big Sur, passing various coastal parks in the area, with no connection to the other side of the Santa Lucia Mountains except for Nacimiento-Fergusson Road. The road briefly leaves the coast for a few miles, passing through a redwood forest in the Big Sur River valley. The Big Sur segment of the highway, built between 1919 and 1937, also crosses a number of historic bridges, including the scenic Bixby Bridge, a reinforced concrete arch with a 320-foot (98 m) span that passes over the Bixby Creek gorge, the Rocky Creek Bridge, and the Big Creek Bridge.\n\nMonterey Bay Area\nAfter crossing the Carmel River, SR 1 turns inland and runs along the eastern boundary of Carmel and the western boundary of Carmel Valley before becoming a freeway in Monterey. After bypassing the immediate coastline of Pebble Beach and the rest of the Monterey Peninsula, the freeway heads north along the coast of Monterey Bay through Sand City, Seaside, and Marina. At the interchange with SR 156 near Castroville, SR 1 continues north as a two-lane rural road to Moss Landing.\nSR 1 becomes a freeway once again just before entering into Santa Cruz County. This four-lane freeway continues up the Monterey Bay coast through Watsonville to its interchange with SR 17 in Santa Cruz. (This trumpet interchange is locally known as The Fishhook due to its tight loop ramps that resemble a fishhook when viewed from above). After a short expressway section, it skirts downtown Santa Cruz as four-lane Mission Street, regaining the Cabrillo Highway designation (local\/historic name is \"Coast Road\") after it leaves the city and continues north-west as a two-lane road (with occasional four-lane sections) up the coast through Davenport.\n\nSan Francisco Bay Area\nEntering San Mateo County, SR 1 follows the west coast of the San Francisco Peninsula, passing by the marine mammal colonies at A\u00f1o Nuevo State Park, and the historic Pigeon Point Lighthouse, before reaching Half Moon Bay. Between Half Moon Bay and Pacifica, the highway bypasses a treacherous stretch known as Devil's Slide via the Tom Lantos Tunnels.\n\nSR 1 then becomes a freeway once again at Sharp Park in Pacifica before turning inland to join Interstate 280 in Daly City. Just short of reaching the City and County of San Francisco, SR 1 splits from Interstate 280, where the road becomes Junipero Serra Boulevard. Shortly thereafter, the highway makes a slight left, becoming the six-lane wide 19th Avenue; the San Francisco Municipal Railway's M Ocean View streetcar line runs in the median from this point until a junction to a rail only right-of-way near Rossmoor Drive. SR 1 then turns into Park Presidio Boulevard after it passes through the city's Golden Gate Park. Then after entering the Presidio of San Francisco, it goes through the MacArthur Tunnel before joining US 101 for a fourth time on the approach to the Golden Gate Bridge known as Doyle Drive.\nAfter crossing the bridge and entering Marin County, SR 1 then splits from US 101 again near Marin City, where it leaves the city and, as the Shoreline Highway, returns to a winding, two lane road as it passes over the Marin Hills to rejoin the coast at Muir Beach. After passing Stinson Beach and the Bolinas Lagoon, SR 1 avoids the immediate coastline of Point Reyes National Seashore and the rest of the Point Reyes Peninsula, and instead heads towards, and then along, the eastern shore of Tomales Bay.\nLeaving Tomales Bay, SR 1 heads further inland to intersect with Valley Ford Road just north of the Sonoma County border. It then rejoins the coast in Bodega Bay, where its name changes to Coast Highway past the Sonoma Coast State Beaches. After bridging the Russian River at Jenner, SR 1 continues to wind along the rugged coast to Fort Ross, Salt Point State Parks, and the planned community of Sea Ranch.\n\nMendocino County\nSR 1 then crosses the Gualala River and enters Mendocino County. The highway enters the city of Point Arena, in which it becomes Main Street, before following School Street to the northwest and then becoming Shoreline Highway once again. It bridges the Garcia River and then, near Elk, the Navarro River, where it meets SR 128.\nAt the town of Albion, the Albion River is spanned by the Albion River Bridge, the only remaining wooden trestle bridge on the highway. SR 1 then passes through Little River and Van Damme State Park, crosses Big River and passes through Mendocino Headlands State Park and the Victorian community of Mendocino. Continuing north, SR 1 crosses Russian Gulch State Park on the Frederick W. Panhorst Bridge, and passes through the town of Caspar. It passes through a roundabout just south of the intersection with the western terminus of SR 20, where it widens to two lanes, then bridges the Noyo River at Noyo, becomes Main Street of Fort Bragg, and crosses the California Western Railroad.\nNorth of Fort Bragg as a two-lane highway again, SR 1 passes MacKerricher State Park and the towns of Cleone and Inglenook before crossing Ten Mile River. After passing Westport-Union Landing State Beach, the road goes through a series of redwood-forested switchbacks before reaching Rockport. North of Rockport, the highway turns away from the Lost Coast to avoid steep and unstable highlands created by Mendocino Triple Junction uplift. The highway follows Cottaneva Creek inland through redwood-forested mountainous terrain before terminating at US 101 just outside Leggett.\n\nHistory\nSR 1 has become famous worldwide, but the highway was signed as several other routes prior to 1964. When the road was first envisioned in the World War I era, California highways were referred to by either a highway name or a route number. The route numbers were used by state highway planners and the Legislature from 1915 until 1964, but were never posted on highways, referred to by the auto clubs or public, nor used on maps. The SR 1 designation was first assigned in 1939. Various portions of SR 1 have been posted and referred to by various names and numbers over the years. State construction of what became SR 1 started after the state's third highway bond issue passed before 1910.\n\nSegments initially constructed\nEager for a direct coastal route between Ventura and Santa Barbara, civic boosters used locally raised funds to begin building the Rincon Sea Level Road in 1911. The route between the Ventura River and Carpinteria had been an unimproved route along small alluvial fan beaches that skirted coastal bluff rock outcroppings at low tide. Construction of the Southern Pacific Coast Line railroad had created a road flanked by riprap along this area. In order to make this part of the first coastal route for motorists driving from San Francisco to Los Angeles, they paved the road and built wooden causeways where the route flooded from the ocean waves. Local funding ran out, but the newly formed State Highway Commission took over and completed the road in 1913.\nOne of the most difficult routes to build was along the Big Sur coast. The state first approved building Route 56, or the Carmel-San Simeon Highway, to connect Big Sur to the rest of California in 1919. Federal funds were appropriated and in 1921 voters approved additional state funds. San Quentin State Prison set up three temporary prison camps to provide unskilled convict labor to help with road construction. One was set up by Little Sur River, one at Kirk Creek and a third was later established in the south at Anderson Creek. Inmates were paid 35 cents per day and had their prison sentences reduced in return. The route necessitated construction of 33 bridges, the largest of which was the Bixby Bridge. Six more concrete arch bridges were built between Point Sur and Carmel.\nAfter 18 years of construction, aided by New Deal funds during the Great Depression, the paved two-lane road was completed and opened on June 17, 1937. The road was initially called the Carmel-San Simeon Highway (Route 56), but was better known as the Roosevelt Highway, honoring the current President Franklin D. Roosevelt. A 1921 law extended Route 56 south over the county road to Cambria.\nRoute 60, from Oxnard via the coast to San Juan Capistrano, was extended from Oxnard to El Rio (midway to Ventura, now the site of the Oxnard Boulevard interchange with US 101), in 1925. At Point Mugu, a path for the highway was cut through the mountains using surplus World War I explosives, thus creating Mugu Rock. The 1921 legislation, in theory, made Route 60 a continuous coastal loop, with both ends at what became US 101 in Oxnard and at Capistrano Beach (since 1964 the southern terminus of SR 1 at Interstate 5 in Orange County). Route 56 was extended further south from Cambria to connect to present-day US 101 in San Luis Obispo in 1931.\nThe route from San Simeon to Carmel (connecting with existing county highways at each end) was one of two sections designated as SR 1. It and Route 60 were intended as links in a continuous coastal roadway from Oregon to Mexico,\nA large expansion of the state highway system in 1933 resulted in Route 56 being extended in both directions. To the south, a second section was added, beginning at Pismo Beach on US 101 (Route 2) and heading south through Guadalupe and Lompoc to rejoin US 101 at a junction called Los Cruces (sic), just north of Gaviota Pass. (A short piece near Orcutt and Los Alamos had been part of Route 2, which originally followed present SR 135 from Los Alamos to Santa Maria.) To the north, Route 56 was continued along the coast from Carmel through Santa Cruz to San Francisco. Several discontinuous pieces were added north of San Francisco, one from Route 1 (US 101) north of the Golden Gate to the county line near Valley Ford, another from the Russian River near Jenner (where the new Route 104 ended) to Westport, and a third from Ferndale to Route 1 near Fernbridge. Except for the gaps in Route 56 north of San Francisco, these additions completed the coastal highway, with other sections formed by Routes 1, 2, and 71.\nThe section of SR 1 from Santa Monica to Oxnard, via Malibu, went out to contract in 1925 as \"Coast Boulevard\", but was designated \"Theodore Roosevelt Highway\" when it was dedicated in 1929. Before the completion of its present alignment in 1937, a narrow, winding, steep road known as Pedro Mountain Road connected Montara with Pacifica. That highway was completed in 1914 and provided competition to the Ocean Shore Railroad, which operated between San Francisco and Tunitas Creek from 1907 to 1920. SR 1 also used to run along the coast between Pacifica and Daly City, but this segment was damaged and rendered unusable after a 5.3 magnitude earthquake on March 22, 1957. A small stub remains near Thornton Beach.\nRoute 56 along Big Sur was incorporated into the state highway system and re-designated as SR 1 in 1939. The section of road along the Big Sur Coast was declared the first State Scenic Highway in 1965, and in 1966 the first lady, Lady Bird Johnson, led the official designation ceremony at Bixby Bridge. The route was designated as an All American Road by the US Government.\n\nSigns first posted\nSR 1 signs first went up after California decided to number its highways, in 1934. The section for Humboldt, Mendocino, Sonoma, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Cruz, Monterey, San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties was posted as SR 1, that section of the road known Route 56 (Las Cruces to Fernbridge). For Ventura, Los Angeles and Orange counties, Route 60 (San Juan Capistrano to the Oxnard area) became SR 3, and a few SR 3 signs were actually posted. The SR 3 signs were replaced by US 101 Alt. shields by 1936, as the road was built out; this change also allowed the extension of US 66 to end at another U.S. Route, in Santa Monica.\nThe gaps of non-state highway along the northern coast were finally filled in by the Legislature in 1951, though the State Department of Public Works was not required to maintain the newly added portions immediately. A connection from near Rockport to Legislative Route 1 (signed US 101) at Leggett was also added to the Legislative Route 56 definition, as the existing county road north from Rockport to Ferndale had not yet been paved.\nThe state Legislature in 1963 tossed out the old conflicting Legislative Route Numbers (1964 renumbering), got rid of some famous old U.S. routes, and renumbered many state highways. It abolished US 101A in Los Angeles, Orange and Ventura counties and renumbered it as SR 1. The Rockport to Leggett connection then became State Route 208. The cover of \"California Highways\" magazine in fall 1964 shows state engineers posting the new shield at Point Mugu. The same year, the Legislature by state law named SR 1 \"Pacific Coast Highway\" in Orange, Los Angeles and Ventura counties, \"Cabrillo Highway\" from Santa Barbara north to San Francisco, and \"Shoreline Highway\" from Marin County to its northern terminus. Many cities, however, did not change the name of city streets that are part of SR 1, such as Lincoln and Sepulveda boulevards in Los Angeles, Santa Monica and El Segundo; and Junipero Serra and Park Presidio boulevards in San Francisco. Several other cities and communities like Newport Beach and Bodega Bay merely named their respective city streets as \"Coast Highway\".\n\nModern alignments\nThe freeway portion of SR 1 from Highway 68 in Monterey to Munras Avenue opened in 1956\u20131960. The segment from Munras Avenue to the northern border of Sand City and Seaside opened in 1968, and bypasses the original highway alignment of Munras Avenue and Fremont Street in Monterey, and Fremont Boulevard through Seaside. North of Seaside, the freeway was built over the original SR 1 alignment through Fort Ord in 1973. North of Fort Ord, SR 1 now veers to the left of the original alignment and bypasses Marina to the west. This segment including the interchange with SR 156 and the short, 2-lane Castroville Bypass opened in 1976. Originally SR 1 followed the SR 156 alignment to the SR 183 intersection in Castroville, then turned northwest, following the present-day SR 183 through Castroville before rejoining its existing alignment at the northern terminus of the Castroville Bypass.\nPlans to upgrade SR 1 to a freeway from its southern terminus all the way to Oxnard, including building an offshore causeway from the Santa Monica Pier to Topanga Canyon Boulevard south of Malibu, were ultimately killed by 1971 due to local opposition. In 1980, another section was added northwest of Ventura near Emma Wood State Beach, when several miles of the old two-lane alignment of U.S. Route 101 were posted as SR 1 where the freeway had bypassed it in about 1960. Then in 1988, the segment from Purisima Road in Lompoc to SR 135 was re-routed from Harris Grade Road to the former County Route S20 so it could directly serve Vandenberg Air Force Base.\nConstruction to bridge the gap in the Lost Coast region between Rockport and Ferndale was eventually abandoned. The steepness and related geotechnical challenges of the coastal mountains made this stretch of coastline too costly for highway builders to establish routes through the area. In 1984, SR 1 was then re-routed to replace State Highway 208, connecting Rockport and Leggett, while the segment between Ferndale and Fernbridge was renumbered as State Highway 211. Most of the coastline in the area is now part of Sinkyone Wilderness State Park and the King Range National Conservation Area.\nThe roadway along Devil's Slide, south of Pacifica, became the site of frequent deadly crashes and roadway-closing landslides. Beginning in 1958, Caltrans supported a plan to construct an inland bypass over Montara Mountain as an alternate route, but was eventually opposed by community and environmental groups who supported a tunnel instead. After decades of legal disputes, the Federal Highway Administration ordered Caltrans in 1995 to re-evaluate the proposed tunnel. Then on November 5, 1996, San Mateo County voters approved Measure T to change the county's official preference from the bypass to the tunnel. Ground eventually broke in 2005, and the Tom Lantos Tunnels opened in April 2013.\nIn 2014, two-way traffic was restored along the original PCH segment from Copper Lantern to Blue Lantern streets in the Dana Point city center after 25 years of one-way operation. During that period, only northbound traffic had flowed along this section of PCH while southbound traffic had been diverted onto the parallel Del Prado Avenue.\nSR 1 has never been planned to extend south into San Diego, or north into Crescent City, where I-5 (which replaced the US 101 designation and signage between Los Angeles and San Diego) and US 101 serve as the coastal highways in those areas, respectively.\n\nAs a cycling venue\nFor the 1932 Summer Olympics, the segment of the SR 1 between Oxnard and Santa Monica (then known as the Theodore Roosevelt Highway) hosted part of the road cycling events. Portions of SR 1 have also hosted stages of the Tour of California.\n\nMaintenance\nCalifornia's coastline is constantly changing and continually presents us with challenges. Through hard work and determination, we continue to keep this scenic highway open.\n\nLandslides\nFrequent landslides and erosion along the coast have caused portions of SR 1 to either be closed for long periods of time, or be re-routed entirely. Some of these include:\n\nA segment along the coast between Pacifica and Daly City in what is now Thornton Beach was damaged and rendered unusable after a 5.3 magnitude earthquake on March 22, 1957. SR 1 was then eventually re-routed to turn inland to join Interstate 280.\nThe Piedras Blancas Realignment Project plans to re-route the road up to 475 feet (145 m) further inland to avoid the expected coastal erosion from the Piedras Blancas Light Station to the Arroyo de la Cruz Bridge in San Luis Obispo County.\nBig Rock Mesa landslide in September 1983 in Malibu was one of the worst in state history. A total of 250 homes collapsed, cracked or slid off their foundation with 30 homes being condemned. The state agreed to pay forty million dollars as cutting through the hillside to build Pacific Coast Highway was a contributing cause.\nThe Devil's Slide area has been prone to major landslides. One slide in 1995 caused the road to be closed for five months, while another in 2006 led to a four-month closure. The Tom Lantos Tunnels, named after former U.S. Congressman Tom Lantos, opened in 2013 to bypass the area.\nIn 2011, major reconstruction was completed between Muir Beach and Stinson Beach, including the addition of a 523-foot-long (159 m), 20-foot-high (6.1 m), but mostly buried, retaining wall. This followed a four-month, $25 million reconstruction that repaired damage from a 2007 landslide.\nA March 2011 landslide in the Big Sur region forced Caltrans to close the highway for several months. A section south of Lucia that is also prone to frequent landslides, known as Pitkins Curve and Rain Rocks, was replaced with a bridge and a covered rock shed.\nDuring the winter of 2016\u20132017, the Big Sur region received more than 60 inches (150 cm) of rain. The road was closed or partially closed due to mudslides and landslides in at least six locations. On February 20, Caltrans declared that the Pfeiffer Canyon Bridge just south of Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park was damaged beyond repair, closing that segment of SR 1 for eight months, and effectively splitting Big Sur in half. Some businesses, cut off from customers and without access to supplies, were forced to close. For some residents, the only means of getting out was via helicopter. In March, Caltrans demolished the bridge and began construction of the replacement. The rebuilt bridge opened on October 13, 2017 at a cost of $24 million.\nAnother major slide at Mud Creek closed a 30-mile (48 km) stretch of the highway in May 2017. The huge slide at Mud Creek covered about one-third mile (0.54 km) of road with 40 feet (12 m) of dirt and rock. The slide was on a section of the road that was already closed due to smaller slides. The scale of the slide was compared to a very large slide during the winter of 1983\u20131984 that closed SR 1 for more than a year. A replacement roadway was built over the landslide and opened in July 2018, at a cost of $40 million.\nAfter heavy rainfall, a section of the highway at mile marker 30, near Rat Creek in Monterey County, collapsed into the ocean in January 2021.  It reopened in April 2021.\nMultiple landslides during successive storm systems in January 2023 forced the closure of nearly 40 miles (64 km) of the highway. As of April 2023, over 25 miles (40 km) of the highway remain closed.\nLandslides in March 2024 forced the closure of a 1.4-mile (2.3 km) stretch north of the Rocky Creek Bridge in the Big Sur region.\n\nFuture projects\nIn 2014, Caltrans relinquished the portion of SR 1 in Oxnard along Oxnard Boulevard. The plan is then for PCH between Pleasant Valley Road and US 101 to be re-routed from Oxnard Boulevard onto Rice Avenue. That segment of Rice Avenue includes a railroad grade crossing at 5th Avenue that was the site of the February 2015 Oxnard train derailment, which eventually led to one death and 29 injuries.

It connects the Los Angeles Basin with the San Gabriel Mountains and the Victor Valley in the Mojave Desert. The highway's southwestern end is at the intersection of Centinela Avenue at the Santa Monica-Los Angeles border and its northeastern end is at SR 138 east of Wrightwood. The SR 2 is divided into four segments, and it briefly runs concurrently with U.S. Route 101 (US 101) and Interstate 210 (I-210). The southwestern section of SR 2 runs along a segment of the east\u2013west Santa Monica Boulevard, an old routing of US 66, to US 101 in East Hollywood; the second section runs along segments of both the north\u2013south Alvarado Street and Glendale Boulevard in Echo Park; the third section to I-210 in Glendale is known as the north\u2013south Glendale Freeway; and the northeastern portion from I-210 in La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge to SR 138 is designated as the Angeles Crest Highway.\n\nRoute description\nSR 2 is known as the Angeles Crest Scenic Byway, a National Forest Scenic Byway, from SR 2's east junction with I-210 in La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge to the Los Angeles\u2013San Bernardino county line. The Big Pines Highway is routed along SR 2 from County Route N4 (CR N4, the northwest continuation of the designation) in Big Pines to the Los Angeles\u2013San Bernardino county line.\nSR 2 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and except for much of the mountain portion is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 2 is eligible to be included in the State Scenic Highway System; however, only the portion of SR 2 from a point northeast of the I-210 interchange to the San Bernardino County line is actually designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), meaning that it is a substantial section of highway passing through a \"memorable landscape\" with no \"visual intrusions\", where the potential designation has gained popular favor with the community.\nThe California Legislature has relinquished state control of various segments of SR 2 in Santa Monica, Los Angeles, Beverly Hills and West Hollywood, and turned them over to local control.\n\nSR 1 to the southeast junction with US 101\nThe original official southwestern terminus of SR 2 was at the junction of Lincoln Boulevard, SR 1, and I-10 in Santa Monica. SR 2 then proceeded northwest on Lincoln Boulevard before turning northeast on Santa Monica Boulevard. Since the California Legislature relinquished segments of the highway, state control of SR 2 now officially begins at the point where Santa Monica Boulevard crosses the Santa Monica\u2013Los Angeles city limits at Centinela Avenue. From Centinela Avenue, SR 2 heads northeast on Santa Monica Boulevard, where it heads northeast through West Los Angeles, Westwood, Century City, and Beverly Hills before entering West Hollywood. Santa Monica Boulevard, as a major street, is for most of its length at least four lanes wide.\n\nAt its west end, Santa Monica Boulevard starts off Ocean Avenue in Santa Monica. From there until Sepulveda Boulevard, Santa Monica Boulevard is a densely urban commercial street. Most of the Westside car dealerships are located on Santa Monica Boulevard. After Sepulveda, Santa Monica Boulevard passes Century City, and intersects Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills.\nThe south roadway of Santa Monica Boulevard, often called Little Santa Monica Boulevard in Beverly Hills, runs parallel to the state highway (north) roadway of Santa Monica Boulevard from the city's west limit to Rexford Drive. After Rexford Drive, Little Santa Monica turns east, becoming Burton Way. Burton Way merges into San Vicente Boulevard at its intersection with La Cienega Boulevard. It is noted that the south roadway of Santa Monica Boulevard in Beverly Hills is a city street while the north roadway of Santa Monica Boulevard is a California state highway, each roadway handling bi-directional traffic.\nAfter intersecting Wilshire, Santa Monica Boulevard continues northeast toward West Hollywood, spanning Beverly Boulevard and Melrose Avenue. At Holloway Drive, in the middle of West Hollywood, Santa Monica, now north of Melrose Avenue turns to the east. In West Hollywood, between Fairfax Avenue and Doheny Drive along Santa Monica Boulevard, bronze name plaques are embedded in the sidewalks as part of the West Hollywood Memorial Walk. SR 2 continues east through Hollywood on Santa Monica Boulevard to the Hollywood Freeway.\n\nRoute 2 then merges onto U.S. Route 101 (the Hollywood Freeway) and heads southeast leaving US 101 at the Alvarado Street exit.\n\nSoutheast junction with US 101 to I-210\nAlvarado Street and Glendale Boulevard\nFrom US 101, Route 2 heads northeast on Alvarado Street through the community of Echo Park. The route then turns north onto Glendale Boulevard.\n\nGlendale Freeway\nAfter crossing Allesandro Street, Route 2 then branches northeast onto the Glendale Freeway, a north\u2013south route. With five lanes each direction, the freeway is quite wide. It intersects the 5 Freeway (the Golden State Freeway) and then crosses the Los Angeles River, and runs through the communities of Glassell Park and Eagle Rock.\nAfter its interchange with the eastern Ventura Freeway (SR 134), the Glendale Freeway route follows a ridge in the San Rafael Hills through eastern Glendale. The freeway ends in the Crescenta Valley, at Foothill Boulevard in La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge. Just before reaching Foothill Boulevard, SR 2 turns off the Glendale Freeway onto the eastbound Foothill Freeway (Interstate 210) for a short distance until reaching the Angeles Crest Highway exit in La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge.\nThe Glendale Freeway was originally proposed to continue through Echo Park all the way to Hollywood Freeway (101). Since that plan has been scrapped, the freeway is somewhat isolated from the remainder of the LA freeway system.\n\nI-210 to Route 138\nLeaving La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge at an altitude of 1,300 feet (400 m), the route turns north onto the Angeles Crest Highway. This route winds generally east-northeast through the canyons of the San Gabriel Mountains for over 80 miles (130 km), before descending through Big Pines and Wrightwood to the edge of the Victor Valley approximately 20 miles (32 km) west of Hesperia and ending at SR 138. The highway climbs to a high point of 7,903 feet (2,409 m) at Dawson Saddle. The eastern portions of the Angeles Crest Highway are notoriously dangerous, with many switchbacks and blind curves, and are often closed during occasions of heavy winter snowfall. The highway is generally closed between Islip Saddle and Vincent Gap from mid-December to mid-May due to snow and rockfall.\n\nHistory\nDesignation\nIn 1964, Route 2 was defined as a single route from Santa Monica to Wrightwood with no discontinuities. The segment of former US 66 on Santa Monica Boulevard west of the Hollywood Freeway and Lincoln Boulevard was added to Route 2 at this time, since US 66 was truncated to Pasadena. Route 2 became discontinuous at Routes 101 and 210 in 1965 and 1990, respectively.\nBefore the segment of the Glendale Freeway was built between Glendale Boulevard and just west of the Los Angeles River, Route 2 began at the Hollywood Freeway on Santa Monica Boulevard, continued east to Myra Avenue, then north on Myra Avenue, east on Fountain Avenue, northeast on Hyperion Avenue, southeast on Rowena Avenue, southeast on Glendale Boulevard, and northeast on Fletcher Drive to just west of the Los Angeles River. From west of the Los Angeles River, Route 2 continued on the Glendale Freeway to its temporary connection with Fletcher Drive at Avenue 38 and then followed the routing described in the previous paragraph to Route 138 northeast of Wrightwood.\nBefore the segment of the Glendale Freeway was built north of Glassell Park, Route 2 continued north on Fletcher Drive to Eagle Rock Boulevard, then north on Eagle Rock Boulevard to Verdugo Road, north on Verdugo to Ca\u00f1ada, north on Ca\u00f1ada back to Verdugo, and north and east on Verdugo to the Angeles Crest Highway (then Haskell Street).\n\nBeverly Hills Freeway\nOriginally, it was to have been the Beverly Hills Freeway from Route 405 to Route 101 just east of Vermont Avenue, flowing onto the Glendale Freeway. In fact, the proposed freeway on Route 2 west of Route 101 was the original routing of the \"Santa Monica Freeway\" (a name which subsequently went to the distantly parallel Route 10). However, for a variety of political reasons, the department never reached agreement with Beverly Hills to build the segment through that city. At one time, the department considered building a cut-and-cover tunnel under Beverly Hills, but even this proved a non-starter, and the freeway plan west of Route 101 was quietly cancelled in 1975. Currently, the Glendale Freeway begins as a stub at Glendale Boulevard. A freeway-wide bridge was built over Glendale Boulevard in hopes that the freeway would be built further west. Today, the bridge serves as the westbound lanes of Route 2, connecting the southwestbound freeway lanes to southbound Glendale Boulevard. A more modest freeway\/expressway extension to Route 101 has been discussed.\nPlanners originally intended for it to connect to the Hollywood Freeway with Route 101 near the Vermont Avenue interchange, but community opposition killed the project by the 1960s (which is why there is a huge median around the cancelled interchange today). The Glendale Freeway offers stunning vistas of the eastern San Fernando Valley, the Verdugo Mountains, the Crescenta Valley, and the San Gabriel Mountains.\nIn the 1960s, the city of Beverly Hills had begun a transition from a quasi-exurban retreat for the entertainment industry to its current status as one of the world's premier shopping and culinary destinations. Building a freeway along Santa Monica Boulevard, the northwestern border of the city's emergent \"Golden Triangle\" shopping district, did not fit into city fathers' vision for Beverly Hills' development. Moreover, it was feared that a freeway would exacerbate the already evident divisions between the fabulously wealthy residents of the hilly areas north of Santa Monica Boulevard and the merely affluent ones to the south. A proposed cut-and-cover tunnel for the freeway failed to generate sufficient political support, and by the mid-1970s the project was essentially dead.\nCalifornia State Senator (later Congressman) Anthony Beilenson was one of the leading opponents of the project.\nCaltrans' decision not to build the freeway was both harmful and beneficial to the areas along its proposed route. The massive Century City high-rise commercial development just west of the Beverly Hills city limits was built with freeway access in mind. For many Century City workers who live in Los Angeles' eastern suburbs, the quickest way home takes them through the residential district of Cheviot Hills, which has caused consternation among its well-heeled residents. For Beverly Hills, the decision helped preserve much of its emergent downtown, but at the cost of creating gridlock on Wilshire Boulevard and I-10.\n\nFurther construction\nThe first segment of freeway was built in the 1950s and ran from just west of the Los Angeles River to Avenue 38 in Glassell Park. This portion was at one time named the Allesandro Freeway, because it runs next to Allesandro Street. The last segment of freeway, from Route 134 to Route 210, was built between 1972 and 1975.\nStarting in July 1964, Route 2 began in Santa Monica at its junction with Routes 1 and 10. After heading a few blocks northwest on Lincoln Boulevard, the route turned northeast on Santa Monica Boulevard, just several blocks from the Pacific Ocean. The route continued on Santa Monica Boulevard to Centinela Avenue.\nFor its entire length, until the tracks were removed, Santa Monica Boulevard followed the tracks of the Pacific Electric Railway. In the portion from Holloway Drive in West Hollywood to Sepulveda Boulevard in West Los Angeles, the tracks were in a separate right-of-way, with two roadways, one on each side of the tracks. For the rest of the route, the tracks ran in the traffic lanes.\nExcept for a short portion at its eastern end, Santa Monica Boulevard was adopted as a state highway in 1933. From 1934 to 1936, it was signed as State Route 2. Then it became U.S. Route 66. When U.S. Route 66 was truncated to Pasadena in 1964, Santa Monica Boulevard once again became State Route 2 as far east as the Hollywood Freeway. Today, the State Route 2 portion of Santa Monica Boulevard is defined from the Santa Monica\/Los Angeles city limits to US 101.\nFrom 1936 to 1964, U.S. Route 66 ran along Lincoln Boulevard from its junction with Alternate U. S. 101 (now California Route 1) and California Route 26 (now replaced by Interstate 10) to Santa Monica Boulevard and along Santa Monica Boulevard from Lincoln Boulevard to the Hollywood Freeway. US 66 turned southeast on the Hollywood Freeway with US 101. At that time, Route 2 began on Alvarado Street at the Hollywood Freeway. As is today, Route 2 traversed Alvarado Street and Glendale Boulevard to the Glendale Freeway. Route 2 continued on the Glendale Freeway to a temporary connection with Fletcher Drive at Avenue 38 in the Atwater district of Los Angeles. From the temporary connection, the route ran northeast on Fletcher Drive, and north on Verdugo Road to its south intersection with Ca\u00f1ada Boulevard in Glendale. From the south intersection, Route 2 headed north on Ca\u00f1ada Boulevard to its north intersection with Verdugo Road, north on Verdugo Road, and east on Verdugo Boulevard, before reaching Foothill Boulevard in La Canada Flintridge. Route 2 continued approximately one mile southeast on Foothill Boulevard with California Route 118 to Angeles Crest Highway. From Foothill Boulevard, Route 2 continued north on Angeles Crest Highway, where it continues to this day.\nToday, the California Transportation Commission is relinquishing the street-running parts of Route 2 to local cities which it runs through. In 1996, state law was changed to permit the relinquishment of Route 2 in Santa Monica and West Hollywood. When the relinquishment in Santa Monica went through in 1998, the portion from Route 1 to Centinela Avenue was deleted. The law was changed again in 2001 to allow Route 2 from Route 405 to Moreno Drive to be relinquished to the City of Los Angeles. In 2003 California Senate Bill 315 was chaptered, acknowledging the relinquishments within Santa Monica, West Hollywood, and from Route 405 to Moreno Drive in Los Angeles, and permitting the relinquishment of Route 2 in Beverly Hills. Whether Route 2 west of Route 101 will stay as a paper route after relinquishment is yet to be determined.\nSince the 1950s, proposals have been made to extend the Glendale Freeway to the Antelope Valley Freeway via a tunnel under the San Gabriels, relieving some of the latter freeway's notorious congestion. The difficulty of designing and building such a route through the mountains (designated SR 249) and the cost of insuring it against earthquakes and terrorism would undoubtedly make perpetually cash-strapped Caltrans unable to undertake such an ambitious project.\n\nIn popular culture\nThe section of freeway between the Ventura Freeway (134) and the Foothill Freeway (210) was largely completed in late 1972, but not fully finished until late spring 1978. During this five year period, the section from just north of the 134 Ventura freeway to approximately Mountain St (Glendale College) was not built. During this time, the closed freeway and an on\/off ramp at Verdugo Blvd in Montrose were used as a location for several films due to its relatively complete construction status, and its proximity to major movie studios in Southern California. Some of these productions included Coffy, Corvette Summer, The Gumball Rally, Death Race 2000, Cannonball, Hardcore, and several American television series including Adam-12, Emergency! and CHiPs. The transition overpass from the eastbound Ventura Freeway to the northbound Glendale Freeway was prominently featured in the notorious disaster film Earthquake when a livestock truck and two cars crash over the side of the overpass (a shot completed in miniature special effects). Ever since it was opened in 1978, this section of freeway is still relatively lightly traveled (especially on weekends), and is still utilized as a filming location, with filming typically done early on weekend mornings.\n\nMajor intersections\nExcept where prefixed with a letter, postmiles were measured on the road as it was in 1964, based on the alignment that existed at the time, and do not necessarily reflect current mileage.

In its final official routing that lasted from 1968 to 2000, SR 42 ran from State Route 1 west of Inglewood (near Los Angeles International Airport) east to what was then a direct interchange with Interstate 5 in Norwalk. Though signed as SR 42, it was officially Route 105 until it was replaced by the parallel Interstate 105 on October 14, 1993. The entire route was deleted from the California Freeway and Expressway System in 2000, with the remaining portion of SR 42 being relinquished to local jurisdictions in that year. The direct interchange with I-5 was later demolished in 2013 in favor widening that portion of the Interstate. However, some SR 42 signs may still remain along the route.\n\nRoute description\nState Route 42 began at Lincoln Boulevard (State Route 1) as Manchester Avenue. East of Sepulveda Boulevard, Manchester Avenue crossed into Inglewood where it is known as Manchester Boulevard. It jogged about two blocks to the north just west of Interstate 405, and back to the south after passing downtown Inglewood. Upon crossing back into Los Angeles, it again became Manchester Avenue.\nAt Central Avenue, the SR 42 entered into the unincorporated community Florence-Graham. It then became Firestone Boulevard and passed through South Gate, Downey, and ended in Norwalk at a merge with Interstate 5 (the Santa Ana Freeway).\n\nHistory\nLegislative Route 174 was defined in 1933 to run from pre-1964 Legislative Route 60 west of Inglewood east to pre-1964 Legislative Route 2 near Santa Ana. It was signed as State Route 10 in the initial signage of routes in 1934, running from State Route 3 (now State Route 1) to U.S. Route 101 near the present junction of Interstate 5 and Anaheim Boulevard. (US 101 and LR 2 left the current I-5 alignment north onto Anaheim Boulevard, eventually entering downtown Los Angeles via present State Route 72.)\nNote: the present alignment of I-5 between Chapman Avenue in Anaheim and Main Street in Santa Ana was also part of LR 174, after a short concurrency of LR 2 and LR 174 in Anaheim. LR 2 used those two streets through Orange, but US 101 was moved to LR 174 once it was built, and so that part of LR 174 was never signed as SR 10. The bypassed section of LR 2 became State Route 51 in the 1964 renumbering, but was removed from the state highway system in 1965.\nBy 1942, the piece of SR 10 east of State Route 19 (Lakewood Boulevard) had been designated U.S. Route 101 Bypass. U.S. Route 101 moved to the present Interstate 5 alignment, formerly US 101 Bypass, by 1959, and SR 10 was truncated to the present I-5\/Firestone Boulevard junction.\n\nAround 1960, SR 10 was renumbered to State Route 42 due to the nearby Interstate 10 (numbered in 1957). This change, which would have normally happened in the 1964 renumbering, was done early due to the closeness of I-10. Route 42 was legislatively defined in that renumbering, running not only from SR 1 to I-5, but beyond to State Route 91 in Anaheim Hills. This route split from the existing SR 42 in Norwalk and ran east along unbuilt pre-1964 Legislative Route 176 to the intersection of State Route 39 (Beach Boulevard) and Imperial Highway. East of SR 39, Imperial Highway was state-maintained, and carried pre-1964 LR 176 and post-1964 SR 42 to its end at SR 91. The whole route, from SR 1 to SR 91, had been added to the California Freeway and Expressway System in 1959.\n\nIn 1965, the unbuilt part from Interstate 605 east to SR 39 was transferred to State Route 90, which had been defined in 1964 to end at I-605; this left a gap in SR 42. The part of SR 42 west of I-605 was added to the Interstate Highway System as Interstate 105 in March 1968, and the legislative changes were made that year - that piece became Route 105, and the piece east of SR 39 became a further extension of SR 90.\nDespite being officially Route 105 since 1968, the route continued to be signed as SR 42, not only along its defined alignment from SR 1 to I-605, but past I-605 to Interstate 5 (which had loosely become part of SR 90 in 1965).\nInterstate 105 was constructed from 1982 to 1994. Even after the new route was finished, the old route continued to be signed as SR 42, even after the last section was relinquished in mid-2000. Some signs still remained in 2004. Since the widening of Interstate 5 between Interstate 605 and the Los Angeles-Orange County line, Firestone Boulevard does not connect with it anymore, instead ending at Bloomfield Avenue. Access to Firestone Boulevard from I-5 is now via Rosecrans Avenue.\n\nMajor intersections\nExcept where prefixed with a letter, postmiles were measured on the road as it was in 1964, based on the alignment that existed at the time, and do not necessarily reflect current mileage.

Located just to the west of the Alameda Corridor, it runs south from the eastern end of the Los Angeles Civic Center down to the east side of California State University, Dominguez Hills and terminating at East Del Amo Boulevard in Carson.\nFrom north to south, Central Avenue passes through Downtown Los Angeles, the areas of South Los Angeles (including Watts, Florence-Graham, Willowbrook), the city of Compton, and the city of Carson, which is part of the 17-city South Bay area of Los Angeles County.\n\nHistory\nCentral Avenue had two all-black segregated fire stations. Fire Station No. 30 and Fire Station No. 14 were segregated in 1924.  They remained segregated until 1956 when the Los Angeles Fire Department was integrated.  The listing on the National Register says, \"All-black fire stations were simultaneous representations of racial segregation and sources of community pride.\"\n\nSignificance in music history\nFrom approximately 1920 to 1955, Central Avenue was the heart of the African-American community in Los Angeles, with active rhythm and blues and jazz music scenes. Local luminaries included Eric Dolphy, Art Pepper, Chico Hamilton, Clora Bryant, and Charles Mingus. Other jazz and R&B musicians associated with Central Avenue in LA include Benny Carter, Buddy Collette, Dexter Gordon, Lionel Hampton, Hampton Hawes, Big Jay McNeely, Johnny Otis, Shifty Henry, Charlie Parker (briefly), Gerald Wilson, Anthony Ortega, Onzy Matthews and Teddy Wilson. Commenting on its historical prominence, Wynton Marsalis once remarked that \"Central Avenue was the 52nd Street of Los Angeles.\" Although Central Avenue is no longer the thriving jazz center it was, its legacy is preserved by the Central Avenue Jazz Festival and a small number of jazz clubs, including Bluewhale in Little Tokyo.\nLeon Hefflin, Sr. produced the first largest outdoor jazz entertainment event of its kind, the \u201cCavalcade of Jazz,\u201d held at Wrigley Field which was located on 42nd place in Los Angeles, part of the Central Ave Jazz Scene and showcased over 125 artists from 1945 to 1958. The Cavalcade of Jazz concerts were the stepping stone to success for such stars as Toni Harper, Dinah Washington, Roy Milton, Frankie Lane and others.  He also hosted a beauty contest at the events.  His first COJ show starred Count Basie, The Honey Drippers, Valaida Snow, Joe Turner, The Peters Sisters, Slim and Bam and more artists on September 23, 1945 with a crowd of 15,000.\n\nJefferson High School, located south east of Downtown Los Angeles, served as a school to a community that not only was located at the heart of South Central\u2019s jazz scene at the time (in the 1930s), but also one that nurtured Jazz affluent students. These students, who would later go on to establish themselves as either jazz\/blues artists\/singers, would follow robust music curriculum, which included courses in music theory, music appreciation, harmony, counterpoint, orchestra, band and choir. Many of Central Avenue\u2019s most accomplished jazz, blues, and bebop players were graduates of this public high school just off the Avenue.  The origin of jazz in Los Angeles has been attributed to a number of musicians who moved there from New Orleans. Nightclubs became the physical manifestation of jazz music, and these were mainly located along Central Avenue from Little Tokyo to Watts. The school produced many prominent musicians, including Etta James, Curtis Williams, Big Jay McNeely, and Richard Berry.\nJefferson High School served as a pivotal structure to a newly established African-American enclave after the turn of the 20th century. The same way many know Harlem as a historically African-American enclave, the area in and around Central Ave was ironically referred to as \u201cLittle Harlem\u201d due to its striking similarities. Harlem\u2019s Apollo theatre and its importance to the neighborhood can be taken by the same token in referring to the many Jazz clubs on Central Ave. However, in this case, looking at the ethnographic nature of Central Ave and its establishing of a Jazz scene and culture, Jefferson High School\u2019s contribution cannot be overstated. Such an institution served in nurturing students, musicians, and athletes\u2014all the while sparking an inevitable culture of Jazz within the already affluent Jazz population.\nCentral Ave paved way for many historic happenings in Los Angeles, most importantly being the many significant structures that contributed to both the creation of an African-American enclave and Jazz scene on the West Coast. It was in 1920, when the Jazz scene on Central began to swing, and from 1920 to 1955 it was the heart of the African-American community in Los Angeles.\nLionel Hampton composed and performed a tune called \"Central Avenue Breakdown\". Dave Alvin's tribute to Big Joe Turner, \"The Boss of the Blues\", describes a drive down Central Avenue and Turner's reminiscences about the scene. Lionel Hampton performed for the 2nd, 5th, 6th, 7th and the 11th Cavalcade of Jazz concerts.  The crowning of the first Cavalcade of Jazz Queen was postponed due to a showdown between Big Joe Turner and Lionel Hampton's band at the 5th concert.  The crowd started throwing pillows, programs, and bottles into the field as the band parading back to the stage.\nUnderground rapper Bones names a song \"CentralAve\" on album \"Rotten\" (2014).\n\nLandmarks and major attractions\nNear its northern end, Central Avenue passes through Little Tokyo, Los Angeles' oldest Japanese neighborhood and now a historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places. On Central Avenue just north of First Street is the former Hompa Hongwangi Buddhist Temple. It was declared Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument No.313 in 1986. Across Central Avenue from the Temple is the Japanese American National Museum, and north of that is the original (and largest) branch of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, now known as the Geffen Contemporary at MOCA. \n\nIn the 1200 block of Central Avenue is the 1930s era Streamline Modern Los Angeles bottling plant of the Coca-Cola company, designed to resemble an ocean liner, complete with porthole windows and metal-railed catwalks. It was declared Los Angeles Historic-cultural Monument #138 in 1975.\nAt 2300 Central is the now closed Lincoln Theatre, opened in 1926 and was long the leading venue in the city for African-American entertainment. It was declared Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument # 744 in 2003.\nAt 4233 Central Avenue is the Dunbar Hotel, Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument #131 since 1974. Built in 1928 by Drs. John and Vada Sommerville, The Dunbar was a place where Black travelers could stay in style and comfort during the era of racial segregation in the United States, when African-Americans were banned from Los Angeles's major hotels. The Dunbar was also the place where Black celebrities were most likely to stay, attracting the likes of Louis Armstrong (\"Satchmo\"), Ella Fitzgerald, Lena Horne, and Billie Holiday.  It was the epicenter of the Los Angeles jazz scene in the 1940s and 1950s. The Dunbar is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nAt 4261 Central Avenue is Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument #580, the 1928 Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Building, original headquarters of one of the leading African-American owned insurance business companies the state of California.\n\nLocated just off of Central Ave on 1319 E 41st St, Thomas Jefferson High School  is central to understanding the Jazz music and the \"Jazz scene\" for which the area was prominent. Jefferson High School\u2019s importance to Central Ave and its Jazz scene can be attributed to its jazz-nurturing curriculum along with many prominent Jazz figures that it has both produced and has been associated with. Jefferson High served as a pivotal touchstone to the newly established African-American enclave and contributed greatly to the development of West Coast Jazz. It was at Jefferson where Samuel Brown (first African-American music teacher in the Los Angeles public school system) taught music and served as a major influence in teaching and mentoring promising jazz musicians from Los Angeles. Due to Mr. Brown's dedication, Jefferson High School has produced more jazz musicians and composers than any other high school west of the Mississippi. \n\nLocated on the corner of 27th Street and Central Ave at 2700 Central Ave is 27th Street Bakery, now famous for its sweet potato pie. The bakery was initially a restaurant that was established in the 1930s by Harry Patterson and his wife. The couple catered to the African-American migrants from the Southern states who settled on and near Central Avenue.  In 1956, the owners decided to turn it into a bakery. The 27th Street Bakery is one of the few remaining African-American owned businesses on Central Ave. The bakery has been in the same family for three generations and is currently owned by Jeanette Pickens, the granddaughter of Harry Patterson, the founder of the bakery. 27th Street Bakery is the largest manufacturer of sweet potato pies on the West Coast of the United States. You can now find their pies in retail stores such Ralphs, Albertsons, 7-Eleven, KFC and Louisiana Famous Fried Chicken. The bakery suffered greatly after the 1992 LA Riots due to the extreme damage done to the neighborhood. Because clientele could not access the bakery for about two weeks, business temporarily decreased.\nFrom the 1950s to the 1990s, the bakery catered towards the needs of the predominant African-American community. Due to the growing population of Latinos\/Hispanics in the area in the early 2000s, the bakery expanded their menu to include concha (bread)\/pan dulce and empanadas to cater to this new community and also have their menu available in Spanish. The 27th Street Bakery is a core part of Central Ave and its surrounding areas and continues to evolve.\nThe Central Avenue Jazz Festival is a yearly free music festival held during the last weekend of July along a stretch of Central Avenue which includes the Dunbar Hotel.  The festival features jazz, blues, and Latin Jazz performed by both well-known and upcoming artists from the area.\nThe opening scene of Raymond Chandler's Farewell, My Lovely, published in 1940, takes place on \"one of the mixed blocks over on Central Avenue, the blocks that are not yet all Negro.\"\n\nTransportation\nCentral Avenue provides bus service along Metro Local: Line 53.\n\nBooks\nCentral Avenue Sounds: Jazz in Los Angeles (Roth Family Foundation Book in American Music), Clora Bryant et al., ISBN 978-0-520-22098-0\nCentral Avenue: Its Rise and Fall, 1890-C1955, Including the Musical Renaissance of Black LA, Bette Yarbrough Cox, ISBN 978-0-9650783-1-3\nThe Great Black Way: L.A.\u2019s Central Avenue in the 1940s And the Rise of African-American Pop Culture, R.J.

Century Boulevard acts as a continuation of Tweedy Boulevard at Alameda Street in South Gate in its east end (Tweedy Boulevard in its east end starts slightly east of Atlantic Avenue), and ends in the west at the passenger terminals at Los Angeles International Airport. Due to its correspondence with the airport, the road has been dubbed \"The Gateway to Los Angeles\".\n\nRoute Description\nCentury Boulevard passes through Watts, Harbor Gateway, South Los Angeles, Inglewood, and Westchester. Upon its connection to the LAX terminal loop, Century Boulevard becomes World Way North, and upon leaving LAX it originates from World Way South.\nThe grid plan of Los Angeles and its numbering of east\u2013west thoroughfares would call for a 100th Street in the position of Century Boulevard, thus spawning the more colloquial title.\nCentury Boulevard marks the southern border for Jesse Owens Park, the Hollywood Park Casino, SoFi Stadium and the Hollywood Park development, and The Village at Century strip mall in Inglewood.\n\nPublic transit\nMetro Local Line 117 operates on Century Boulevard.\n\nFuture Developments\nPotential Redevelopment\nLos Angeles officials have expressed a desire to renovate Century Boulevard.

The hotel was designed by architects Arnold A. Weitzman and William Douglas Lee and completed in 1929. It was modeled loosely after the Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise, a royal retreat in France's Loire Valley.\nThe hotel is known as both a long- and short-term residence for celebrities \u2013 historically \"populated by people either on their way up or on their way down\" \u2013 as well as a home for New Yorkers in Hollywood. The hotel has 63 rooms, suites, cottages, and bungalows.\nIn 2020, the hotel announced plans to become a members-only hotel. These plans were withdrawn in 2022.\n\nHistory\nDesign and construction\nIn 1926, Fred Horowitz, a prominent Los Angeles attorney, chose the site at Marmont Lane and Sunset Boulevard to construct an apartment building. Horowitz had recently traveled to Europe for inspiration and returned to California with photos of a Gothic Chateau (Chateau d'Amboise where Leonardo da Vinci is buried) located along the Loire River. In 1927, Horowitz commissioned his brother-in-law, European-trained architect Arnold A. Weitzman, to design the seven-story, L-shaped building based on his photos from France. When deciding upon a name for the building, Chateau Sunset and Chateau Hollywood were rejected in favor of Chateau Marmont, after the small street running across the front of the property.\nOn February 1, 1929, Chateau Marmont opened its doors to the public as the newest residence of Hollywood. Local newspapers described the Chateau as \"Los Angeles's newest, finest and most exclusive apartment house [\u2026] superbly situated, close enough to active businesses to be accessible and far enough away to ensure quiet and privacy.\" For the inaugural reception, over 300 people passed through the site, including local press.\n\nConversion to hotel\nDue to the high rents and inability to keep tenants for long-term commitments during the Great Depression, Horowitz sold the apartment building in 1931 to Albert E. Smith, co-founder of Vitagraph Studios, for $750,000 in cash (equivalent to $15,030,000 in 2023). Smith converted the building into a hotel, an investment which benefitted from the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. The apartments became suites with kitchens and living rooms. The property was also refurbished with antiques from Depression-era estate sales. During the 1930s, the hotel was managed by former silent film actress Ann Little.\nDuring World War II, the hotel served as an air-raid shelter for residents in the surrounding area. From about 1942 to 1963 the Chateau was owned by Erwin Brettauer, a German banker who had funded films in Weimar Germany, and was noted for allowing Black guests, breaking the long-standing color line in Hollywood and Beverly Hills hotels.\nDesigned and constructed to be earthquake-proof, Chateau Marmont survived major earthquakes in 1933, 1952, 1971, 1987, and 1994 without sustaining any major structural damage. Nine Spanish cottages, as well as a swimming pool, were built next to the hotel in the 1930s and were acquired by the hotel in the 1940s. Craig Ellwood designed two of the four bungalows in 1956, after he completed Case Study Houses.\n\nAcquisition by Sarlot-Kantarjian\nBusiness was good for the hotel, although by the 1960s, the building was in disrepair, and the owners attempted to sell it multiple times. News articles about the hotel from the 1960s and 1970s described it as an \"elderly castle\", a \"dowdy hotel\", \"rundown\", and \"shabby-genteel\".\n\nAfter sitting on the market for two years, the hotel was sold in 1975 to Raymond R. Sarlot and Karl Kantarjian of Sarlot-Kantarjian, a real estate development firm, for $1.1 million. Sarlot-Kantarjian planned to expand the hotel with a new wing. They repaired and upgraded many elements of the hotel, but tried to stay true to the hotel's character and history. In 1976, after their acquisition and improvements began, the Chateau was named a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument. In The New York Times, writer Quentin Crisp praised the Chateau's \"avoiding undue modernization and stayed deliberately in the romantic past.\"\n\nRestoration and operation under Balazs\nThe hotel was acquired in 1990 by Andr\u00e9 Balazs. Balazs needed to modernize the hotel while also preserving Chateau Marmont's character. For the restoration, Balazs strove to create the illusion that the hotel had been untouched, notwithstanding renovations. The entire facility was re-carpeted, repainted, and the public spaces were upgraded.\nIn order to preserve the privacy of the hotel and bungalows, higher fences plus coverings were used to discourage the public from looking into the grounds.\nOn July 28, 2020, the Chateau Marmont announced plans to convert to a members-only hotel, although at least one restaurant would remain open to the public.\nOn September 16, 2020, The Hollywood Reporter published a report involving accounts from more than thirty former hotel employees that accused the hotel's management and Balazs of fomenting racial discrimination and sexual harassment practices at the hotel; they also accused Balazs of neglecting to provide them with adequate health insurance during the COVID-19 pandemic and suspected the hotel's members-only conversion as an attempt to prevent unionization among the hotel's employees. Despite the denial of the allegations by the hotel management and Balazs, multiple employment discrimination lawsuits were filed against the hotel, with the hotel facing picketing from labor union UNITE HERE and boycotts from numerous celebrities; in support of the boycott, a night shoot at the hotel for Aaron Sorkin's Being the Ricardos was canceled just hours before the intended start of production.\nOn May 1, 2024, paramedics were called to the hotel when Britney Spears and her boyfriend allegedly got into a domestic dispute. Spears was seen leaving the hotel wearing just her underwear and covering herself with a blanket as she walked out barefoot. Spears did not seek medical assistance despite the alleged incident.\n\nDining\nThe hotel restaurant terrace features market-fresh California cuisine from chef Dean Yasharian. The restaurant Bar Marmont closed in 2017.\nIn July 2018, Chateau Hanare, a new restaurant, opened in a former residential building on the eastern edge of the property. Balazs had spent five years courting the restaurateur, Reika Alexander of New York City's EN Japanese Brasserie.\n\nIn popular culture\nThroughout the years, Chateau Marmont has gained recognition. Anthony Bourdain, Johnny Depp, Tim Burton, Death Grips, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Anthony Kiedis, Annie Leibovitz, Courtney Love, Lana Del Rey, Jay McInerney, Helmut Newton, Dorothy Parker, Nicholas Ray, Terry Richardson, Hunter S. Thompson, and Bruce Weber, among others, have produced work at the hotel. Duran Duran guitarist Andy Taylor married the band's hairdresser Tracey Wilson at the hotel in 1982.\n\nOn film\nDirector Sofia Coppola shot her film Somewhere at the hotel in 2010. The hotel also appears in the Academy Award-winning films La La Land (2016) and A Star Is Born (2018), as well as The Night Walker (1964), The Strip (1951), Myra Breckinridge (1970), Blume in Love (1973), The Doors (1991), Dangerous Game (1993), Laurel Canyon (2003), and Maps to the Stars (2014). The opening scene from The Canyons (2013) was shot at the now-closed Bar Marmont.\n\nIn literature\nThe Chateau is featured\u2014often as a setting\u2014in many books, including Martin Amis's Money (1984) (as the Vraimont), Eve Babitz's Eve's Hollywood (1974) and Slow Days, Fast Company (1977), James Ellroy's The Big Nowhere (1988), Dominick Dunne's An Inconvenient Woman (1990) and Another City, Not My Own (1997), Charles Bukowski's Hollywood (1989), Lee Child's Bad Luck and Trouble (2007), Lauren Weisberger's Last Night at Chateau Marmont (2010), and Michael Connelly's The Drop (2011). It is also the office of fictional paparazzo Patrick Immleman in the Panel Syndicate web comic The Private Eye.\n\nIn music\nThe hotel has also been referred to in many songs, including the title track \"Plastic Hearts\" by Miley Cyrus from her 2020 album, \"chateau\" by blackbear from his 2017 album digital druglord, Panic! At The Disco's \"Dying in LA\", the Grateful Dead's \"West L.A.

Designed to exhibit widescreen Cinerama films, it opened November 7, 1963. The original developer was William R. Forman, founder of Pacific Theatres. The Cinerama Dome continued as a leading first-run theater, most recently as part of the ArcLight Hollywood complex, until it closed temporarily in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in California. The ArcLight chain closed permanently in April 2021, with the theater never having reopened. In June 2022, it was announced that there were plans to reopen it and the former ArcLight Hollywood under a new name, Cinerama Hollywood.\n\nHistory\nIn February 1963, Cinerama Inc. unveiled a radically new design for theaters that would show its movies. They would be based on the geodesic dome developed by R. Buckminster Fuller, would cost half as much as conventional theaters of comparable size, and could be built in half the time. Cinerama's goal was to see at least 600 built worldwide within two years. The following April, Pacific Theatres Inc. announced plans to build the first theater based upon the design, and had begun razing existing buildings at the construction site. Located on Sunset near Vine Street, it would be the first new major motion-picture theater in Hollywood in 33 years and would be completed in time for the scheduled November 2 press premiere of It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. The design was proposed by French architect Pierre Cabrol, lead designer in the noted architectural firm of Welton Becket and Associates. Pierre Cabrol worked with R. Buckminster Fuller during his studies at MIT.\nPacific Theatres founder, William R. Forman, announced the construction of the Cinerama Dome in July 1963 at a star-studded, ground-breaking ceremony where Spencer Tracy, Buddy Hackett, Mickey Rooney, Dick Shawn, Edie Adams, and Dorothy Provine donned hard hats, and, with picks and shovels, began construction. Forman had committed to United Artists that the theatre would be ready for the November 7, 1963, world premiere of the first movie filmed in the new 70mm, single-strip Cinerama process, Stanley Kramer's It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, World. Working around the clock, the entire construction spanned only 16 weeks. The Cinerama Dome is the only concrete geodesic dome in the world. The theatre is made up of 316 individual hexagonal and pentagonal shapes in 16 different sizes. Each of these pieces is approximately 12 feet (3.7 metres) across and weighs around 7,500 pounds (3,400 kilograms). The theatre also has design elements such as a loge section with stadium seating, architecturally significant floating stairways, and, at the time of its opening, the largest contoured motion-picture screen in the world, measuring 32 ft (9.8 m) high and 86 ft (26 m) wide, with a maximum aspect ratio of 2.69:1.\nThe It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World premiere (filmed in Ultra Panavision 70) marked the dawn of \"single lens\" Cinerama. Previously, Cinerama was known for its groundbreaking three-projector process. From 1963 until 2002, the Cinerama Dome never showed movies with the three-projector process. (The nearby Warner Cinerama at 6433 Hollywood Boulevard used the three-projector process until December 1964.) A unique \"rectified\" print was made with increased anamorphic compression towards the sides, which compensated for distortions that would otherwise be induced by Cinerama's deeply curved screen.\n\n21st century\nIn 2002, after a two-year closure, the Cinerama Dome was reopened as a part of Pacific Theatres' ArcLight Hollywood complex. The dome remains essentially unchanged, though there have been improvements, notably, in the acoustics. But for the first time ever, the Cinerama Dome began showing movies in the three-projector format. It is one of four known Cinerama theaters left in the world, the others include: Pictureville Cinema, Seattle Cinerama, The New Neon Cinema, and Cinerama restorationist and former Canadian broadcast engineer, Tom H. March's Calgary basement.\n\n\"Cinerama was installed at the National Media Museum (formerly the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television) in Bradford, UK\" (Pictureville Cinema)\n\"The Cinerama Preservation Society, Inc. presented true three-projector showings of Cinerama films at the Neon Movies (Dayton, Ohio) between 1996 and 2000.\"\nThe Cinerama Dome made its digital projection debut in May 2005 with Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith. In 2009, James Cameron's Avatar was the first 3D film to be shown in the Cinerama Dome, using technology from XpanD 3D.\nIn December 2015, the Cinerama Dome upgraded to a laser-projection system, using two Christie 6P projectors and Dolby 3D. The venue is still capable of both 35mm and 70mm-film projection.\n\nIn April 2021, the parent company of Pacific Theatres announced that it would not be reopening any of its locations, including the Cinerama Dome, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Later in the year, it was reported that a permit had been filed with provisions for a bar and restaurant.\nIn June 2022, it was reported that Decurion Corp. had plans to reopen the theater under the name Cinerama Hollywood along with the adjoining fourteen-screen multiplex. There were also plans to include two bars and a restaurant at the location. Three months later, it was reported that the theater would not be reopening until at least the latter part of 2023; however, in May 2023, it was reported that it was delayed once again to the latter part of 2024. In November 2023, the cinema's reopening was again delayed this time until the second quarter of 2025 due mostly in part to the redesign happening in the space including the addition of restaurants and event space.\n\nPreservation\nWith its 86 feet (26 m) wide screen, advanced acoustics and 70mm film capability, the Cinerama Dome remained a favorite for film premieres and \"event\" showings. But by the late 1990s, the motion picture exhibition business began to favor multiplex cinemas, and Pacific Theatres proposed a plan to remodel the Dome as a part of a shopping mall\/cinema complex. Historical preservationists were outraged, not wishing to see another great theater turned into a multiplex or destroyed. At the same time, a small contingent of Cinerama enthusiasts had begun resurrecting the three-projector process. They and the preservationists prevailed upon Pacific to rethink its plans for the property.\nThe preservation of the Cinerama Dome came at a time when most other surviving Cinerama theaters were being demolished. An example of this was the case of the Indian Hills Theater in Omaha, Nebraska, a round Cinerama theater boasting a 110-foot screen that was razed in 2001 to make room for a parking lot.\nThe Cinerama Dome was declared a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument in 1998.\n\nSee also\nList of Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monuments in Hollywood\nSeattle Cinerama\nPictureville Cinema\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nCinerama\nArcLight Cinemas\nPacific Theatres\nCinerama Dome and ArcLight Hollywood at Cinema Treasures","55":"Coldwater Canyon Avenue (designated as Coldwater Canyon Drive south of Mulholland Drive) is a street, primarily within the City of Los Angeles, in Los Angeles County, California.

It runs from Griffith Park in Los Angeles east through Glendale, the Eagle Rock section of Los Angeles, Pasadena, and Arcadia, ending in Monrovia. The full route was once various state highways but is now locally maintained in favor of the parallel Ventura Freeway (SR 134) and Foothill Freeway (I-210).\n\nRoute description\nWest end\nThe west end of Colorado Boulevard is composed of two segments: a disconnected surface street segment of Colorado Boulevard, and the Colorado Street Freeway Extension. Colorado Boulevard begins at a cul-de-sac near the Los Angeles River in Los Angeles and continues east. The road passes on\/off-ramps to the eastbound Colorado Street Freeway Extension, and Edenhurst Avenue, which provides access to the westbound freeway. The segment terminates at West San Fernando Road near the Los Angeles-Glendale city limits, and picks up across the railroad corridor at San Fernando Road in the city of Glendale as Colorado Street.\nThe Colorado Street Freeway Extension begins at Interstate 5 (Golden State Freeway) as a short freeway spur, originally carrying State Route 134 until it was moved north onto the Ventura Freeway, but is still maintained by Caltrans. After crossing the Los Angeles River, there is an eastbound interchange with Colorado Boulevard (signed as Edenhurst Avenue), a westbound interchange with Edenhurst Avenue, and an eastbound interchange with Elk Avenue (signed as San Fernando Road). The freeway then terminates at Colorado Street in Glendale. Traffic exiting the Colorado Street Freeway Extension cannot turn west onto Colorado Street, but eastbound traffic from Colorado Street can enter the freeway. The freeway's entrances are signed as entrances to Interstate 5.\nAt the east border of Glendale, Colorado Street becomes Colorado Boulevard as it crosses State Route 2 (Glendale Freeway) into Los Angeles (specifically, the neighborhood of Eagle Rock). Another short freeway spur splits west of the intersection with Figueroa Street, heading northeast to the Ventura Freeway. This spur also carried SR 134 after the Ventura Freeway was built to the east but before it was built west of the split with the spur. After crossing Figueroa Street, Colorado Boulevard splits from Linda Vista Avenue and then passes over the Arroyo Seco on the Colorado Street Bridge into Pasadena.\n\nThrough Pasadena\nIn Pasadena, Colorado Boulevard crosses the short State Route 710 spur and forms the north end of State Route 110 (Arroyo Parkway). Colorado Street, renamed \"Boulevard\" in 1958, runs through Old Town Pasadena from Arroyo Parkway to Orange Grove Boulevard. It is the north\u2013south zero axis of the street grid in Pasadena (the east\u2013west axis is Fair Oaks Avenue). The Tournament of Roses parade route travels north on Orange Grove Avenue then east along Colorado Boulevard as far as Sierra Madre Boulevard, where it heads north to Victory Park. Most major Pasadena attractions are found along or within one block of Colorado Boulevard. Pasadena City College is located at 1570 East Colorado Boulevard. The street was mentioned in Jan and Dean's 1964 hit song The Little Old Lady from Pasadena. The road leaves the city into unincorporated East Pasadena, where it intersects Rosemead Boulevard (Former State Route 19), all while formerly signed as California State Route 248.\n\nThrough Arcadia and Monrovia\nColorado Boulevard becomes Colorado Street as it crosses Michillinda Avenue from East Pasadena into Arcadia. Through Arcadia, the street parallels the Foothill Freeway, providing access to many of the neighborhoods in west Arcadia; freeway access is provided via a separated interchange with Baldwin Avenue.  Colorado Street then turns southeast and splits into two streets\u2014Colorado Boulevard, which continues east, and Colorado Place, a short segment of old US 66 that goes southeast to merge with Huntington Drive near the Santa Anita Racetrack.\nFrom the split, Colorado Boulevard (originally named Orange Street) becomes a primarily residential street, with some commercial zones near Santa Anita Avenue in Arcadia.  The street passes under the Foothill Freeway between First and Second Streets in Arcadia with no access, in front of Monrovia High School, and through Old Town Monrovia before ending at Shamrock Avenue at Recreation Park in Monrovia. (This segment of Shamrock Avenue was once part of an early alignment of US 66 and had been named Foothill Boulevard.)\nThe Santa Anita Depot, built in 1890 to serve Lucky Baldwin, and the people of Rancho Santa Anita, was located at Colorado Boulevard and Old Ranch Road. It was moved to the Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden during the construction of the 210 Foothill Freeway in 1970.\n\nHistory\nThe most original portion of Colorado Boulevard ran from Orange Grove Boulevard to Broadway, now Arroyo Parkway. This portion of the street always contained many shops, banks, hotels, and major commercial industries. By the late 19th century, this part of Colorado had become so popular, it was becoming a traffic bottleneck, and as early as May 1900 there were public outcries to the City Council to widen the road. It wasn't until 1929 that the City undertook the major and unprecedented task of cutting back the buildings along Colorado 14 feet (4.3 m) on each side. This undertaking created a monumental amount of legal red tape as well as many engineering dilemmas which were handled with amazing results. At the same time many of the Victorian facings on the buildings were replaced with Spanish and Art Deco designs.\nThe Colorado Street Railway began operations in Pasadena on November 9, 1886, bringing mass transit to the street via the new horsecar service. The line was electrified in 1894 and was eventually absorbed into the Pacific Electric system. The Lamanda Park Line and other local services operated in the center of the roadway until January 19, 1941.\nColorado Street and Colorado Boulevard carried pre-1964 Legislative Route 161 from its west end to the merge with Huntington Drive (via Colorado Place). This was signed as State Route 134 west of Figueroa Street, U.S. Route 66 Alternate (US 66 before the end of 1940) from Figueroa Street to Arroyo Parkway, and U.S. Route 66 from Arroyo Parkway to Huntington Drive.\nIn 1954, the Colorado Freeway was opened between Holly Street in Pasadena and Eagle Vista Drive and Colorado Boulevard in Eagle Rock to help alleviate traffic congestion due to the narrow Colorado Street Bridge over the Arroyo Seco.  The new freeway connected the two communities until 1971, when the entire freeway was closed and upgraded, as well as partially rerouted as the new Ventura Freeway.  A short segment of the original Colorado Freeway remains as an on-ramp\/off-ramp between Colorado Boulevard in Eagle Rock and the Figueroa Street off-ramp of the present Ventura Freeway.\nIn the 1964 renumbering, LR 161 remained State Route 134 west of Pasadena, though this was being moved to the new alignment (now the Ventura Freeway); until the freeway was completed through Pasadena in the mid-1970s, Colorado Boulevard was still signed as State Route 134 between Orange Grove Avenue and Arroyo Parkway. Through and east of Pasadena, LR 161 became State Route 248, but was signed as US 66 and continued east on Huntington Drive to the interchange with Interstate 210 (Foothill Freeway) in Monrovia. In 1965, this was to be deleted when I-210 was completed.\nThe US 66 shields began to come down along the length of Route 248 in 1975, soon after Interstate 210 was completed through Pasadena.  SR 248 was never signed as such, though it did appear on some maps in the 1970s and 1980s.  The segment within the city of Pasadena was deleted from the state highway system in 1986. The rest was removed in 1992. Along with the moving of SR 134 to the Ventura Freeway, this resulted in Colorado Street and Colorado Boulevard becoming a local road.\n\nTransit\nColorado Boulevard is served by several bus routes, operated by Metro and suburban systems. Metro Local line 180 serves most of Colorado Boulevard, running between Hollywood and Pasadena. Also, Foothill Transit line 187 serves parts of Colorado Boulevard, beginning in Old Pasadena. LADOT DASH Eagle Rock\/Highland Park serves most of Colorado Boulevard in Eagle Rock. Glendale Transit line 6 serves Colorado Street in Glendale.\nMetro has identified Colorado Boulevard as a potential bus rapid transit corridor, part of a line between North Hollywood station and Pasadena approved in 2016's Measure M. The bus rapid transit project would need to include removable components to allow for the annual staging of the Rose Parade.  Some local residents fear increased traffic congestion due to the proposed bus rapid transit route, while others support increasing access to high-quality transit.\n\nIn popular culture\nThe street is mentioned in the 1964 Jan & Dean single The Little Old Lady (from Pasadena), with the protagonist described as the \"terror of Colorado Boulevard.\"\nIn S05E13 of The Big Bang Theory, Sheldon says to Leonard: \"It\u2019s not about you. It\u2019s about a poor immigrant from Pakistan trying to make his way in America by working the graveyard shift at the Colorado Boulevard Chevron\", When talking about the gas station across their road.\n\nSee also\nList of streets in the San Gabriel Valley\n\nReferences\n\n\n== External links ==","58":"The Comedy Store is an American comedy club opened in April 1972. It is located in West Hollywood, California, at 8433 Sunset Boulevard on the Sunset Strip. An associated club is located in La Jolla, San Diego, California.\n\nHistory\nThe Comedy Store was opened in April 1972 by comedians Sammy Shore (1927\u20132019), and Rudy De Luca. The building was formerly the home of Club Seville (1935), later, Ciro's (1940\u20131957), a popular Hollywood nightclub owned by William Wilkerson, and later Ciro's Le Disc, a rock and roll venue, where The Byrds were discovered in 1964.\nWhen the venue reopened as The Comedy Store in 1972, it included a 99-seat theatre. As a result of a divorce settlement, Sammy Shore's ex-wife Mitzi Shore began operating the club in 1973, and she was able to buy the building in 1976. She immediately renovated and expanded the club to include a 450-seat main room.\nIn 1974, The Comedy Store hosted the wedding reception of newlyweds Liza Minnelli and Jack Haley, Jr. The Comedy Club signage was covered, for the evening, by signs reading \"Ciro's\", denoting the venue's prior identity.  The event was attended by many dozens of Hollywood glitterati, including Elizabeth Taylor, Sammy Davis Jr., Cher, Bob Fosse, Johnny Carson, Goldie Hawn, Cesar Romero, Priscilla Presley and other stars, past and present.\n\nLocations\nThe original Comedy Store on Sunset at Ciro's had been joined by the Comedy Store Westwood, at 1621 Westwood Blvd., the Comedy Store La Jolla, at 916 Pearl St., Comedy Store Playhouse, on Las Palmas, Comedy Store at the Sheraton Universal Hotel, in Universal City, and the Comedy Store Las Vegas at the Dunes Hotel.\n\nJob action\nBeginning in 1979, The Comedy Store served for many years as the host location for the annual HBO Young Comedians specials.\n\nTension between the club owners stems from a 1979 strike of Los Angeles comedians against the Comedy Store's \"no-pay policy\". Until that time, neither Shore nor Friedman paid comedians a salary. The theory was that comedians should almost be paying the owners for the exposure the clubs provided. When the comedians' strike began, The Improv (opened in 1974 at 8162 Melrose Avenue) was closed for fire-damage repairs. Therefore, the strike focused on Shore, not Friedman.\nAlso in 1979, stand-up comedians formed a short-lived labor union and demanded to be paid for their appearances at The Comedy Store. For six weeks (beginning in March), several comedians staged a protest in front of the club, while others crossed the picket line. The comedians involved formed a union called Comedians for Compensation and fought for pay where they had received none before. They eventually picketed in front of the club when their demands were not met. Jay Leno and David Letterman were among those on the picket line while Garry Shandling and Yakov Smirnoff crossed the line.\nThe job action was not legally a strike as the comedians were classified as \"independent contractors\" and were not under contract with the club.\nMitzi Shore argued that the club was and had always been a showcase and training ground for young comedians and was not about profits. She alleged that comedians came to the club and could work on their material in front of casting agents and other talent scouts who would possibly hire them as professionals if they were good enough.\nThe comedians at the club became unhappy when the club was expanded several times and it was perceived that Shore's profits were quite substantial. Shore also paid the rest of her staff, including waitresses and bartenders.\nAfter the strike, some comedians were no longer allowed to perform at the club, including Steve Lubetkin, who committed suicide by jumping off the roof of the Continental Hyatt House next door. His suicide note included the line: \"My name is Steve Lubetkin. I used to work at The Comedy Store.\" Lubetkin hoped that his suicide would resolve the labor dispute. He also cited Shore as the reason he no longer had a job.\nThe union ceased to exist in 1980, although from the time of the job action onward, comedians in Los Angeles were paid for their shows. This included The Comedy Store and The Improv.\n\nCresthill house\nMitzi Shore also owned a 5,000-square-foot house a few doors away from the club, on 8420 Cresthill Road. The house was bought with the club in 1976. In 1979, she started to let the comedians from the clubs sleep there. During the 1980s, numerous comedians resided or just partied there, including Andrew Dice Clay, Marc Maron, Robin Williams, and Richard Pryor. Argus Hamilton and Mike Binder were the first to officially move into the house. Dave Coulier was also an early resident, and Yakov Smirnoff moved in in 1980. The place was known for its all-night parties and heavy consumption of cocaine and alcohol. Bill Hicks moved there in 1980 when he was 18 and running away from his parents to pursue his career as a comedian. Many of those comedians developed their style while residing there. Sam Kinison was a pillar there, and Jim Carrey turned his act around in this house. Mitzi Shore had a plan to cash in on the house's unique atmosphere, and even shot a 12-minute pilot around 1987 starring Daphne Davis, Nancy Redman, and Tamayo Otsuki. In 1988, because of the debauchery that had been going on for years, Mitzi Shore kicked everybody out of the house and turned it into a recovery house. By the early 1990s, Her son Pauly moved into the house, and by the end of the 1990s, the house was sold.\n\nNotable alumni\nKnoedelseder, William (2009).

The mall features a central building designed to resemble an ocean liner surrounded by a small village of cottage-style bungalows. It was designed by Robert V. Derrah, built in 1936, and has been called America's first outdoor shopping mall.\nOnce a busy shopping center, the Crossroads later became private offices, primarily for the entertainment industry with a variety of music publishers and producers, television and film script writers, film and recording companies, novelists, costume designers, publicists, and casting agencies. The owner is planning a new development surrounding the site.\n\nHistory\nIn 1931, after Charles H. Crawford's death, his wife Ella decided to build a multi-national outdoor market that would feel like \"a permanent world's fair with a cosmopolitan atmosphere\" on the land where her husband was shot. She hired the Streamline Moderne architect Robert V. Derrah (who was finishing his work on the Coca-Cola Building) to design the complex.\nDerrah designed a ship-shaped structure in the center of the complex. The surrounding buildings represented different countries of the world. The complex originally held 57 shops and cafes, and 36 offices on the upper floors. The Crossroads of the World was inaugurated on October 29, 1936. The new shopping center was not a full-blown success, but it became an excellent model for outdoors malls across the world.\nIn the 1950s, the Crossroads of the World was converted into an office complex. The Screen Actors Guild, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, Jackson Browne and Alfred Hitchcock used to rent offices there. The property was purchased in 1977 by the real estate investor Mort La Kretz and restored. On June 1, 1985, Michael Perricone founded Interlock Studios, an audio post production facility, which was located in Bungalow 1522 of the complex, until 1998, when it relocated to 6520 Sunset Boulevard, and was sold to Rick Larson a few years later, who renamed it Larson Studios.\nIn January 2019, the Los Angeles City Council approved the project to revamp the Crossroads of the World in a move to revitalize the district. Three high-rise buildings are planned to bring 950 apartments and condos, a 308-room hotel, and 190,000 square feet (18,000 m2) of commercial space. Preservationists called the redevelopment project a \"Manhattanization of Hollywood\". Eighty-two Hollywood Regency garden apartments are to be demolished in the project. These rent stabilized apartments are occupied by a decades-old, tight-knit community of largely low-income, predominantly Latino residents. Over 100 apartments in the project will be set aside for very low-income families.\n\nIn popular culture\nFilms:\n\nThe Muppets\nL.A.

The road had various names in its early years, including Speedway, the Ballona Road, the Playa Del Rey Road, the Redondo Road, the Hollywood-Redondo Boulevard, and Putnam Avenue. The name Culver Boulevard seems to have to been settled upon around 1925, following the annexation of Venice by the city of Los Angeles.\n\nHistory\nThe development of what is now Culver Boulevard was a project of the Automobile Club of Southern California, which was lobbying for roadways for private vehicles at a time when railways or even horses-and-carriages were the primary means of transportation around Los Angeles. In fall 1903, rights-of-way were granted by landowner R.C. Gillis and the Los Angeles Pacific Railway for the planned road, which was to be 30 ft (9.1 m) wide. By December, the Los Angeles Times was reporting \"Greased Rushaway from Los Angeles to Playa Del Rey Fully Assured.\" The plan was for a \"seven-mile straightaway\" from Ivy Station (described as just beyond the junction of Adams and Washington streets) to the beach resort village of Playa Del Rey. \nIndustrialist Homer Laughlin weighed in, advocating firmly in favor of automobiles generally in February 1904.\n\nAt present the public does little else but slur the automobile as a 'red devil of destruction.' If people want good roads let them cease their outcry against the automobile, for through that agency [the Automobile Club of Southern California] good roads will be obtained. The road to Playa Del Rey is rapidly nearing completion and a heavy layer of macadam is being placed on the approach to the seashore that passes over the sand.\nElsewhere in the paper that day, the plan for what would become Culver Boulevard was succinctly summarized: \"The plan is to leave Ivy Station, just this side of Palms, and parallel the Los Angeles-Pacific's electric road's line to Playa Del Rey.\" Apparently this route's advantages included that the \"friendly\" railway was offering their rights-of-way and that its \"gravel pits, cars and tracks\" would help the Auto Club with the \"big fill across the marsh from Alla station to the beach.\"\nBy May 1904, the road was being called Speedway, the first of its names. The road-building was started from the west, Beach to City; the rights-of-way closer to the city were proving more of a challenge. \nAs of August 1904, boosters were pitching the \"nearly straight\" railroad route from Ivy Station to the Playa Del Rey resort \"paralleling\" the \"nearly complete\"  Auto Club speedway. Sometime in late August or early September, \"graders at work on the automobile road found the remains of two persons.\"\nBy 1907, the Los Angeles Times reported that men who wanted to go duck hunting at the Ballona, \"have such good roads to go over that the automobile is as generally used for transportation as the electric cars\u2026The road taken by the Ballona clubmen runs out either Washington or Adams streets to the junction near Ivy Station, and continues out on the Ballona road, branching off to go to clubs at various points near the beach.\"\n\nCirca 1911, \"Down to Ivy Station, the road is bad, then it is ordinary as far as Palms, fairly good as far as Clarkdale, and beyond that it is pretty good in the middle, but along the edges are ruts\u2026to the intersection with the Motordrome road the going is ordinarily good, but beyond that for half a mile it is bad.\"\n\nIn 1912 real estate developer Harry Culver worked to refine the segment of the Playa Del Rey route that passed through his forthcoming \"Culver City\" real estate project. He called it \"Putnam Boulevard\" and the Los Angeles Evening Herald reported, \"According to present plans, Putnam boulevard will follow the line of the Pacific Electric Playa del Rey line through Washington Park to a point west of Inglewood [Avenue]...It will form an automobile outlet for thousands of acres of land lying between the Washington boulevard and Redondo boulevard that heretofore has been inaccessible by automobile\u2026It will be fully 100 feet in width the entire distance and lined by artistic electroliers, forming a great white way from Los Angeles to Redondo.\"\nThe Culver Boulevard nomenclature was decided in 1925-26, and for a period of months in 1926 the designation referred to the entirety of what is now Robertson Boulevard, beginning in West Hollywood all the way down Vista Del Mar to Manhattan Beach and beyond.\nHowever, Harry Culver apparently objected and the old so-called Hollywood-Redondo Road was not unified, but separated, into Culver and Robertson, with the division lying at Venice Boulevard.\nPutman Avenue is still labeled on the 1928 Pacific Electric route map, but in small print, whereas Culver Boulevard is marked in bright green capital letters.\n\nIt was in 1928 that the developers of the planned Palisades Del Rey residential subdivision announced the \"widening and permanent paving of the two-mile stretch of Culver Boulevard between Centinela Avenue and Jefferson Boulevard\u2026this will complete the paving on Culver Boulevard, which stretches from Culver City to the ocean.\"\nPhotos taken of Culver in 1929 show elaborate street lights installed along the route at that time. \nOn the occasion of the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, the L.A. Times published a guide to Los Angeles' farms for visitors. The guide mentioned that \"Venice-Playa Del Rey-Cienega\" was a key district for market gardening, especially of summer celery, and mentioned intensive cultivation practices that were getting three or four crops out of the same field in one year. Tourists interested in such a thing were advised to navigate to Culver City, then \"turn south and west on Culver Boulevard\u2026a few miles beyond Culver City on this boulevard will bring one to the center of the vegetable district.\"\nCulver Boulevard made occasional brief appearances in Laurel & Hardy and Our Gang shorts produced by the nearby studios.\nThe streetcar line shut down during the Great Depression and the track was thereafter used for freight until the 1980s. The cities of Los Angeles and Culver City redeveloped the abandoned railroad right-of-way into the Culver Boulevard Median Bike Path in the 1990s.\n\nLandmarks\nCulver Hotel\nSony Pictures Studios\nCitizen Public Market in the Citizens Publishing Company Building\nDickinson & Gillespie building in Playa Del Rey\nNew Deal-era post office mural inside PWA Moderne Culver City post office\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nCulver City Historic Images Gallery","62":"\"Dead Man's Curve\" is a 1964 hit song by Jan and Dean whose lyrics detail a teen street race gone awry. It reached number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and number 39 in Canada. The song was written and composed by Brian Wilson, Artie Kornfeld, Roger Christian, and Jan Berry at Wilson's mother's house in Santa Monica. It was part of the teenage tragedy song phenomenon of that period, and one of the most popular such selections of all time. \"Dead Man's Curve\" was added to the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2008.\n\nPremise\nThe singer goes out for a leisurely drive one night in his Corvette Sting Ray, when a driver pulls up alongside in his Jaguar XKE and challenges him to a drag race. According to the song, the race starts at Sunset and Vine, traveling westbound on West Sunset Blvd., passing North La Brea Ave., North Crescent Heights Blvd., and North Doheny Dr. The original Schwab's Pharmacy was located just east of Crescent Heights on Sunset. The North Whittier Drive curve, a nearly 90\u00b0 right turn traveling west on Sunset Boulevard just past North Whittier Drive, may have been the \"dead man's curve\" in the song, but there is debate on the actual location of the curve. Coincidentally, Jan Berry, of Jan and Dean, would himself later be involved in a near-fatal incident in 1966, when he crashed his own Sting Ray into a parked truck on North Whittier Drive near (but not on) Dead Man's Curve.\nThe song ends with the singer relating his last memories of the ill-fated race to a doctor. Sound effects of screeching tires and crashing are also heard in the song. Deadman's Curve was used as the title for the 1978 biographical nationally televised movie about Jan and Dean, starring Richard Hatch and Bruce Davison respectively portraying Berry and Torrence.\n\nVersions\nThree versions of \"Dead Man's Curve\" were released:\n\nVersion #1: Original version from the 1963 Drag City album\nVersion #2: Single \"hit\" version with added horns, strings, additional backing vocals, and sounds of a car skidding and crashing; from the 1964 Dead Man's Curve\/The New Girl In School LP\nVersion #3: An earlier rejected studio mix from the 1966 Filet of Soul album.\nLive versions appear on the 1965 Command Performance and 1971 Anthology albums\nThere are a few minor lyrical differences between versions #1 and 3 and version #2 listed above:\n\nVersions #1 & 3 \u2013 \"my frenched tail lights\", \"the strip was deserted\", and \"pulled her out and there I was\"\nVersion #2 \u2013 \"my six tail lights\", \"the street was deserted\", and \"pulled her out and there we were\"\nThere are two basic versions:\nVersion one: Lead and backing vocals: Jan Berry\nBackground vocals: Jan Berry, Brian Wilson, Gary Usher.

Founded as the Screen Directors Guild in 1936, the group merged with the Radio and Television Directors Guild in 1960 to become the modern Directors Guild of America.\n\nOverview\nAs a union that seeks to organize an individual profession, rather than multiple professions across an industry, the DGA is a craft union. It represents directors and members of the directorial team (assistant directors, unit production managers, stage managers, associate directors, production associates, and location managers (in New York and Chicago)); that representation includes all sorts of media, such as film, television, documentaries, news, sports, commercials and new media.\nThe guild has various training programs whereby successful applicants are placed in various productions and can gain experience working in the film or television industry.\nAs of 2020, the guild had more than 18,000 members. The DGA headquarters are on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, with satellite offices in New York and Chicago and coordinating committees in San Francisco, Chicago, and London.\n\nComposition\nAccording to DGA's Department of Labor records, the guild's reported membership classifications currently account for 1,532 \"retirees\" (about 10% of total membership), 323 \"suspended\" members (2%), and 5 \"life\" members (<1%), compared to 13,577 \"active\" members. \"Suspended\" members pay dues but are ineligible to vote in the union. DGA contracts also cover some non-members, known as agency fee payers. These non-members currently number 172, or about 1% of the size of the union's membership.\n\nMembership\nThe DGA site lists the following for membership:\n\nUpon the DGA's receipt of a deal memo or commercial project listing form (\"CPLF\") from a DGA signatory Employer which confirms your bona fide employment in a DGA-covered category, you will be sent an application for membership which will include your required initiation fee and other information. The DGA does not provide applications for membership upon request.\nYour membership in the DGA is subject to approval by your category Council. Applications for membership are submitted to the appropriate Council upon submission of a completed application form and payment of the requisite initiation fee. The DGA membership application form requires endorsements from three members within your application category, your resume and brief biography, your home address and other contact information. Your application must be notarized.\nMembership categories are:\n\nDirector: Feature\/Television\nDirector: Commercial, Documentary, Low Budget Feature, Staff, Segment\nUnit Production Manager\n1st Assistant Director\n2nd Assistant Director\nAD\/UPM Low Budget\nAssociate Director\nStage Manager\nAD\/SM Low Budget\nProduction Associate (West)\nProgram Production Assistant (East)\nMembership initiation fees in 2022 ranged from $200 for a Production Associate to $13,416 for a feature director.\nThe DGA site listed the following for dues in 2022:\n\nDGA membership dues are basic dues of $50 per quarter and income dues based on gross earnings working in all DGA categories. Gross income includes but is not limited to base salary, overtime, residuals, deferments, percentage compensation, completion of assignment, vacation and holiday pay, profit participation and fees of all kinds in any Guild category. DGA members must report all gross earnings from Guild-covered employment and pay the corollary percentage dues quarterly. Dues on gross earnings are calculated at one and one-half percent (1+1\u20442 %) of a member's reported gross earnings from employment in all Guild categories, provided that such dues are payable only on gross annual income between $10,000 and $300,000. In addition to basic and percentage dues, members also pay an additional one percent (1%) of the total residuals they receive in connection with employment under a DGA collective bargaining agreement\n\nLabor agreements\nThe agreements signed between the guild and film and television production companies make various stipulations covering pay and working conditions for guild members and require that all those employed in the relevant fields on a film made by that company are guild members. Guild members are generally prevented from working for companies that have not signed an agreement with the DGA. This sometimes leads production companies that have no such agreement to form new companies, purely for the purpose of making a particular film, which do then sign an agreement with the DGA.\nThe Guild enters into negotiations with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), the organization that represents the studios, networks and production companies, approximately every three years to update and renew the Basic Agreement and the Freelance Live and Tape Television Agreement, the DGA's two major agreements. The DGA negotiates minimum compensation levels that must be paid by the companies. Many DGA members have agents who may negotiate rates above the minimums for their clients. The DGA agreements also secure residual payments for the reuse of members' work in film, television and new media.\nOther than wages and basic working conditions, the DGA has a particular role in protecting the creative rights of film and TV directors. Such protections that the guild provides include defining the director's role, ensuring, with examples, the principle of \"one director to a picture\" and the right to prepare a director's cut or edit. Generally, each of these protections is to help offset the power that producers can have over a director during the film-making process.\n\nDGA Awards\nThe DGA hosts the annual DGA Awards, an important precursor to the Academy Awards. In its 69-year history, the DGA Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Feature Film has been a near perfect barometer for both the Best Director, and in some cases, the Best Picture Academy Award. Only seven times has the DGA Award winner not won the corresponding Best Director Academy Award. Honorees are awarded with a statue manufactured by Society Awards.\n\nCredits\nThe rule that a film can only have one single director was adopted to preserve the continuity of a director's vision and to avoid producers and actors lobbying for a director's credit, or studios hiring multiple directors for a single film or television episode.\nThe rule is waived only for directorial teams recognized by the DGA who have a history of working together and sharing a common vision. Examples include The Wachowskis, Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, Hughes brothers, Russo Brothers, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller and the Coen brothers. The Coens for years divided credit, with Ethan taking producing credit, Joel taking directing credit, and both of them sharing the writing credit (even though the two of them shared all three duties between themselves) until The Ladykillers in 2004.\nAn example of the DGA refusing to recognize a directorial team was Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller for Sin City; they were rejected because they had never worked together before; Rodriguez quit the DGA so that Miller would share director's credit.\nFor the film Bohemian Rhapsody, director Bryan Singer was fired due to frequent absences and clashing on the set, with Dexter Fletcher replacing him with two weeks left of filming. Singer still received director credit and Fletcher received executive producer credit.\nIn the past, the DGA has also engaged in disputes with the Writers Guild of America (WGA) over possessory credits, first used in the 1915 film The Birth of a Nation. The WGA tried to limit possessory credits to writers, but has always been successfully opposed by the DGA, leaving directors free to try to negotiate such credits if they wish.\n\nNon-member directors\nNot all Hollywood directors are DGA members. Notable exceptions include George Lucas and Robert Rodriguez. Quentin Tarantino directed six feature films before becoming a DGA member, in 2012. Those who are not members of the guild are unable to direct for the larger movie studios, which are signatories to the guild's agreements that all directors must be guild members.\n\nLeadership\nThe following are the past Presidents of the Screen Directors Guild and the DGA:\n\nDGA Director's Finder Series\nThe Director's Finder Series (or Director's Finder Screening Series), inaugurated in December 1998, provides for the screening of independent films with no U.S. distributor, and no previous TV or other distribution. Selected by a lottery, the films are screened in DGA theatres in Los Angeles and New York City to an audience of DGA members and invited potential distributors. Many films have been picked up by distributors via the series that may not otherwise have been spotted. The series was initiated by the DGA's Independent Directors' Committee, chaired by Steven Soderbergh, initially for U.S. films only, but later expanded to include Australian, Irish, British and New Zealand directors, via the International Association of English-Speaking Directors Organisation (IAESDO). By 2007, the series had screened more than 75 films. The DGA has collaborated with organisations such as the Screen Directors Guild of Ireland (SDGI) and the Australian Directors' Guild (ADG), which nominate one film to participate.\nAustralian entries, selected for the Finders Series Award by the ADG from a shortlist of four, include Boxing Day (2007), directed by Kriv Stenders; and after a five-year lapse, Tony Krawitz's documentary The Tall Man (2012), and in 2014 Catriona McKenzie's Satellite Boy was selected for the series.\nIrish entries include Terry McMahon's Patrick's Day (2014) and Ross Whitaker's Katie (2018).\n\nDirectors Guild Foundation\nDirectors Guild Foundation, founded in 1945, as Directors Guild of America Educational and Benevolent Foundation publishes the Directors Guild of America Oral History series, and provides an interest-free loan program, a Cognitive Wellness Program, and flu shot clinics.\n\nSee also\nAlan Smithee\nRunaway production\nStage Directors and Choreographers Society\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website","64":"Doheny Drive is a north\u2013south thoroughfare mostly through Beverly Hills and West Hollywood, in Los Angeles County, California.\nIt is named for Edward L.

The song was intended as the third single from their Evil Empire album, although a domestic single was never released.\nThe song addresses social inequality between the rich and poor of America, and the simmering class warfare that existed in the band's home city of Los Angeles following the 1992 Los Angeles Riots. The lyrics of the opening verse, where the song gets its title, leave unclear why the narrator is driving with a shotgun through the upscale shopping district of Rodeo Drive. Although the shotgun motif suggests violence, band lyricist Zach De La Rocha stated in 2011 that the band \"never advocated violence\". Shotguns are often seen as self defense weapons, and \"Down Rodeo\" was written just three years after six days of riots were sparked by police violence against minorities in the city. The full lyric must be put into context of the time period and the beating of Rodney King to be understood: \"So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun, These people ain't seen a brown skin man, Since their grandparents bought one\".\n\nSee also\nPolitical views and activism of Rage Against the Machine\n\nTrack listing\n\"Down Rodeo\"\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial Website\nDown Rodeo at AllMusic","66":"Cesario Estrada Chavez (; Spanish: [\u02c8t\u0283a\u03b2es]; March 31, 1927 \u2013 April 23, 1993) was an American labor leader and civil rights activist. Along with Dolores Huerta, he co-founded the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA), which later merged with the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC) to become the United Farm Workers (UFW) labor union. Ideologically, his worldview combined left-wing politics with Catholic social teachings.\nBorn in Yuma, Arizona, to a Mexican-American family, Chavez began his working life as a manual laborer before spending two years in the U.S. Navy. Relocating to California, where he married, he got involved in the Community Service Organization (CSO), through which he helped laborers register to vote. In 1959, he became the CSO's national director, a position based in Los Angeles. In 1962, he left the CSO to co-found the NFWA, based in Delano, California, through which he launched an insurance scheme, a credit union, and the El Malcriado newspaper for farmworkers. Later that decade, he began organizing strikes among farmworkers, most notably the successful Delano grape strike of 1965\u20131970. Amid the grape strike, his NFWA merged with Larry Itliong's AWOC to form the UFW in 1967. Influenced by the Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi, Chavez emphasized direct nonviolent tactics, including pickets and boycotts, to pressure farm owners into granting strikers' demands. He imbued his campaigns with Roman Catholic symbolism, including public processions, Masses, and fasts. He received much support from labor and leftist groups but was monitored by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\nIn the early 1970s, Chavez sought to expand the UFW's influence outside California by opening branches in other U.S. states. Viewing illegal immigrants as a major source of strike-breakers, he also pushed a campaign against illegal immigration into the U.S., which generated violence along the U.S.-Mexico border and caused schisms with many of the UFW's allies. Interested in co-operatives as a form of organization, he established a remote commune at Keene. His increased isolation and emphasis on unrelenting campaigning alienated many California farmworkers who had previously supported him, and by 1973 the UFW had lost most of the contracts and membership it won during the late 1960s. His alliance with California Governor Jerry Brown helped ensure the passing of the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act of 1975, although the UFW's campaign to get its measures enshrined in California's constitution failed. Influenced by the Synanon religious organization, Chavez re-emphasized communal living and purged perceived opponents. Membership of the UFW dwindled in the 1980s, with Chavez refocusing on anti-pesticide campaigns and moving into real-estate development, generating controversy for his use of non-unionized laborers.\nChavez became a controversial figure. UFW critics raised concerns about his autocratic control of the union, the purges of those he deemed disloyal, and the personality cult built around him, while farm owners considered him a communist subversive. He became an icon for organized labor and leftist groups in the U.S. His reception by Maria Elena Lucas on his October, 1981 visit to dedicate the first Farm Worker Service Center in the Midwest evidences his continuing appeal to migrant farm worker activists.  Posthumously, he became a \"folk saint\" among Mexican Americans. His birthday is a federal commemorative holiday in several U.S. states, while many places are named after him, and in 1994 he posthumously received the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nEarly life\nChildhood: 1927\u20131945\nCesario Estrada Chavez was born in Yuma, Arizona on March 31, 1927. He was named for his paternal grandfather, Cesario Chavez, a Mexican who had crossed into Texas in 1898. Cesario had established a successful wood haulage business near Yuma and, in 1906 bought a farm in the Sonora Desert's North Gila Valley. Cesario had brought his wife Dorotea and eight children with him from Mexico; the youngest, Librado, was Cesar's father. Librado married Juana Estrada Chavez in the early 1920s. Born in Ascensi\u00f3n, Chihuahua, she had crossed into the U.S. with her mother as a baby. They lived in Picacho, California before moving to Yuma, where Juana worked as a farm laborer and then an assistant to the chancellor of the University of Arizona. Librado and Juana's first child, Rita, was born in August 1925, with their first son, Cesar, following nearly two years later. In November 1925, Librado and Juana bought a series of buildings near to the family home which included a pool hall, store, and living quarters. They soon fell into debt and were forced to sell these assets, in April 1929 moving into the galera storeroom of Librado's parental home, then owned by the widowed Dorotea.\nChavez was raised in what his biographer Miriam Pawel called \"a typical extended Mexican family\"; she noted that they were \"not well-off, but they were comfortable, well clothed, and never hungry\". The family spoke in Spanish, and he was raised as a Roman Catholic, with his paternal grandmother Dorotea largely overseeing his religious instruction; his mother Juana engaged in forms of folk Catholicism, being a devotee of Santa Eduviges. As a child, Chavez was nicknamed \"Manzi\" in reference to his fondness for manzanilla tea. To entertain himself, he played handball and listened to boxing matches on the radio. One of six children, he had two sisters, Rita and Vicki, and two brothers, Richard and Librado.\nCesario began attending Laguna Dam School in 1933; there, the speaking of Spanish was forbidden and Cesario was expected to change his name to Cesar. After Dorotea died in July 1937, the Yuma County local government auctioned off her farmstead to cover back taxes, and despite Librado's delaying tactics, the house and land were sold in 1939. This was a seminal experience for Cesar, who regarded it as an injustice against his family, with the banks, lawyers, and Anglo-American power structure as the villains of the incident. Influenced by his Roman Catholic beliefs, he increasingly came to see the poor as a source of moral goodness in society.\nThe Chavez family joined the growing number of American migrants who were moving to California amid the Great Depression. First working as avocado pickers in Oxnard and then as pea pickers in Pescadero, the family made it to San Jose, where they first lived in a garage in the city's impoverished Mexican district. They moved regularly, and on weekends and holidays, Cesar joined his family in working as an agricultural laborer. In California, he moved schools many times, spending the longest time at Miguel Hidalgo Junior School; here, his grades were generally average, although he excelled at mathematics. At school, he faced ridicule for his poverty, while more broadly, he experienced anti-Latino prejudice from many European-Americans, with many establishments refusing to serve non-white customers. He graduated from junior high in June 1942, after which he left formal education and became a full-time farm laborer.\n\nEarly adulthood: 1946\u20131953\nIn 1944, Chavez enlisted in the U.S. Navy, and was sent to the Naval Training Center San Diego. In July, he was stationed at the U.S. base in Saipan, and six months later moved to Guam, where he was promoted to the rank of seaman first class. He was then stationed to San Francisco, where he decided to leave the Navy, receiving an honorable discharge in 1946. Relocating to Delano, California, where his family had settled, he returned to working as an agricultural laborer.\nIn 1947, Chavez joined the National Farm Labor Union (NFLU), which, until its 1947 affiliation with the American Federation of Labor, was the Southern Tenant Farmers Union (STFU). (Later, the NFLU became the National Agricultural Workers Union.) That year, he was picketing cotton fields in Corcoran, near Delano, for the NFLU. The union had called a strike against the DiGiorgio grape fields in 1947.  As in the STFU's strikes against cotton plantations in Arkansas, strikers formed \"caravans\" and marched around the perimeter of the DiGiorgio property, asking its workers to join them.  Chavez led one of those caravans.\nChavez entered a relationship with Helen Fabela, who soon became pregnant. They married in Reno, Nevada in October 1948; it was a double wedding, with Chavez's sister Rita marrying her fianc\u00e9 at the same ceremony. By early 1949, Chavez and his new wife had settled in the Sal Si Puedes neighborhood of San Jose, where many of his other family members were now living. Their first child, Fernando, was born there in February 1949; a second, Sylvia, followed in February 1950; and then a third, Linda, in January 1951. The latter had been born shortly after they had relocated to Crescent City, where Chavez was employed in the lumber industry. They then returned to San Jose, where Chavez worked as an apricot picker and then as a lumber handler for the General Box Company.\nHere, he befriended two social justice activists, Fred Ross and Father Donald McDonnell, both European-Americans whose activism was primarily within the Mexican-American community. Chavez helped Ross establish a chapter of his Community Service Organization (CSO) in San Jose, and joined him in voter registration drives. He was soon voted vice president of the CSO chapter. He also helped McDonnell construct the first purpose-built church in Sal Si Puedes, the Our Lady of Guadalupe church, which was opened in December 1953. In turn, McDonnell lent Chavez books, encouraging the latter to develop a love of reading. Among the books were biographies of the saint Francis of Assisi, the U.S. labor organizers John L. Lewis and Eugene V. Debs, and the Indian independence activist Mahatma Gandhi, introducing Chavez to the ideas of nonviolent protest.\n\nEarly activism\nWorking for the Community Service Organization: 1953\u20131962\nIn late 1953, Chavez was laid off by the General Box Company. Ross then secured funds so that the CSO could employ Chavez as an organizer, traveling around California setting up other chapters. In this job, he traveled across Decoto, Salinas, Fresno, Brawley, San Bernardino, Madera, and Bakersfield. Many of the CSO chapters fell apart after Ross or Chavez ceased running them, and to prevent this Saul Alinsky advised them to unite the chapters, of which there were over twenty, into a self-sustaining national organization. In late 1955, Chavez returned to San Jose to rebuild the CSO chapter there so that it could sustain an employed full-time organizer. To raise funds, he opened a rummage store, organized a three-day carnival and sold Christmas trees, although often made a loss.\nIn early 1957, he moved to Brawley to rebuild the chapter there. His repeated moving meant that his family were regularly uprooted; he saw little of his wife and children, and was absent for the birth of his sixth child.\nChavez grew increasingly disillusioned with the CSO, believing that middle-class members were becoming increasingly dominant and were pushing its priorities and allocation of funds in directions he disapproved of; he for instance opposed the decision to hold the organization's 1957 convention in Fresco's Hacienda Hotel, arguing that its prices were prohibitive for poorer members. Amid the wider context of the Cold War and McCarthyite suspicions that leftist activism was a front for Marxist-Leninist groups, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began monitoring Chavez and opened a file on him.\nAt Alinsky's instigation, the United Packinghouse Workers of America (UPWA) paid $20,000 to the CSO for the latter to open a branch in Oxnard; Chavez became its organizer, working with the largely Mexican farm laborers. In Oxnard, Chavez worked to encourage voter registration. He repeatedly heard concerns from local Mexican-American laborers that they were being routinely passed over or fired so that employers could hire cheaper Mexican guest workers, or braceros, in violation of federal law. To combat this practice, he established the CSO Employment Committee that launched a \"registration campaign\" through which unemployed farm-workers could sign their name to highlight their desire for work.\n\nThe Committee targeted its criticism at Hector Zamora, the director of the Ventura County Farm Labor Association, who controlled the most jobs in the area. It also used sit ins of workers to raise the profile of their cause, a tactic also being used by proponents of the civil rights movement in the southern United States at that time. It had some success in getting companies to replace braceros with unemployed Americans. Its campaign also ensured that federal officials began properly investigating complaints about the use of braceros and received assurances from the state farm placement service that they would seek out unemployed Americans rather than automatically hiring bracero labor. In May, the Employment Committee was formerly transferred from the CSO to the UPWA.\nIn 1959, Chavez moved to Los Angeles to become the CSO's national director. He, his wife, and (now) eight children settled into the largely Mexican neighborhood of Boyle Heights. He found the CSO's financial situation was bad, with even his own salary in jeopardy. He laid off several organizers to keep the organization afloat. He tried to organize a life insurance scheme among CSO members to raise funds, but this project failed to materialize. Under Chavez, the CSO secured financing from wealthier donors and organizations, usually to finance specific projects for a set period of time. The California American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) for instance paid it $12,000 to conduct voter registration schemes in six counties with high Mexican populations. The wealthy benefactor Katy Peake then offered it $50,000 over three years to organize California's farm workers. Under Chavez's leadership, the CSO assisted the successful campaign to get the government to extend the state pension to non-citizens who were permanent residents. At the ninth annual CSO convention in March 1962, Chavez resigned.\n\nFounding the National Farm Workers Association: 1962\u20131965\nIn April 1962, Chavez and his family moved to Delano, California, an agricultural community in the southern San Joaquin Valley, where they rented a house on Kensington Street. He was intent on forming a labor union for farm workers but, to conceal this aim, told people that he was simply conducting a census of farm workers to determine their needs. He began devising the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA), referring to it as a \"movement\" rather than a trade union. He was aided in this project both by his wife and by Dolores Huerta; according to Pawel, Huerta became his \"indispensable, lifelong ally\". Other key supporters of his project were the Reverend Jim Drake and other members of the California Migrant Ministry; although as a Roman Catholic Chavez was initially suspicious of these Protestant preachers, he came to view them as key allies.\nChavez spent his days traveling around the San Joaquin Valley, meeting with workers and encouraging them to join his association. At the time, he lived off a combination of unemployment benefit, his wife's wage as a farmworker, and donations from friends and sympathizers. On September 30, 1962, he formalized the Association at a convention in Fresno. There, delegates elected Chavez as the group's general-director. They also agreed that, once the association had a life insurance policy up and running, members would start paying monthly dues of $3.50. The group adopted the motto \"viva la causa\" (\"long live the cause\") and a flag featuring a black eagle on a red and white background. At the organization's constitutional convention held in Fresno in January 1963, Chavez was elected president, with Huerta, Julio Hernandez, and Gilbert Padilla its vice presidents.\n\nChavez wanted to control the NFWA's direction and to that end ensured that the role of the group's officers was largely ceremonial, with control of the group being primarily in the hands of the staff, headed by himself. At the NFWA's second convention, held in Delano in 1963, Chavez was retained as its general director while the role of the presidency was scrapped. That year, he began collecting membership dues, before establishing an insurance policy for FWA members. Later in the year he launched a credit union for NFWA members, having gained a state charter after the federal government refused him one. The NFWA attracted volunteers from other parts of the country. One of these, Bill Esher, became editor of the group's newspaper, El Malcriado, which soon after launching increased its print run from 1,000 to 3,000 to meet demand.\nThe NFWA was initially based out of Chavez's house although in September 1964 it moved its headquarters to an abandoned Pentecostal church in Albany Street, West Delano. During its second full year in operation the association more than doubled both its income and its expenditures. As it became more secure, it began to plan for its first strike. In April 1965, rose grafters approached the organization and requested help in organizing their strike for better working conditions. The strike targeted two companies, Mount Arbor and Conklin. Aided by the NFWA, the workers struck on May 3, and after four days the growers agreed to raise wages, after which the strikers returned to work. Following this success, Chavez's reputation began to filter through leftist activist circles across California.\n\nDelano Grape Strike\nStart of the Delano Grape Strike: 1965\u20131966\nIn September 1965, Filipino American farm workers, organized by the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC), initiated the Delano grape strike to protest for higher wages. Chavez and his largely Mexican American supporters voted to support them. The strike covered an area of over 400 square miles (1,000 km2); Chavez divided the picketers among four quadrants, each with a mobile crew led by a captain. As the picketers urged those who continued to work to join them on strike, the growers sought to provoke and threaten the strikers. Chavez insisted that the strikers must never respond with violence. The picketers also protested outside strike-breakers' homes, with the strike dividing many families and breaking friendships. Police monitored the protests, photographing many of those involved; they also arrested various strikers. To raise support for those arrested, Chavez called for donations at a speech in Berkeley's Sproul Plaza in October; he received over $1,000. Many growers considered Chavez a communist, and the FBI launched an investigation into both him and the NFWA.\n\nIn December, the United Automobile Workers (UAW) president Walter Reuther joined Chavez in a pro-strike protest march through Delano. This was the first time that the strike attracted national media attention. Reuther then pledged that the UAW would donate $5,000 a month to be shared between the AWOC and NFWA. Chavez also met with representatives of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), which became an important ally of the strikers. Influenced by the civil rights movement's successful use of boycott campaigns, Chavez decided to launch his own, targeting companies which owned Delano vineyards or sold grapes grown there. The first target selected, in December 1965, was the Schenley liquor company, which owned one of the area's smaller vineyards. Chavez organized pickets to take place in other cities where Schenley's grapes were being delivered for sale.\nBy 1965, Chavez was aware that the numbers joining the picket lines had declined; although hundreds of pickers had initially struck, some had returned to their jobs, found employment elsewhere, or moved away from Delano. To keep the pickets going, Chavez invited left-wing activists from elsewhere to join them; many, particularly university students, came from the San Francisco Bay Area. Recruitment was fueled by coverage of the strike in the SNCC's newspaper, The Movement, and the Marxist People's World newspaper. By late fall 1966, a protest camp had formed in Delano, opening its own medical clinic and children's nursery. Protesters were entertained by Luis Valdez's El Teatro Campesino, which put on skits with a political message. Within the protest movement there were some tensions between the striking farm-workers and the influx of student radicals.\n\nGrowing success: 1966\u20131967\nIn March 1966, the U.S. Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare's Subcommittee on Migratory Labor held three hearings in California. The third, which took place in Delano, was attended by Senator Robert F. Kennedy, who toured a labor camp with Chavez and addressed a mass meeting. As the strike began to flag in winter, Chavez decided on a march of 300 miles (480 km) to the state capitol at Sacramento. This would pass through dozens of farmworker communities and attract attention for their cause. In March, the procession started out with about fifty marchers who left Delano.\nChavez imbued the march with Roman Catholic significance. Marchers carried crucifixes and a banner of the Virgin of Guadalupe and used the slogan \"Peregrinaci\u00f3n, Penitencia, Revoluci\u00f3n\" (\"Pilgrimage, Penitence, Revolution\"). Portraying the march as an act of penance, he argued that the image of his personal suffering\u2014his feet became painful and for part of the journey he had to walk with a cane\u2014would be useful for the movement. At each stop, they read aloud a \"Plan de Delano\" written by Valdez, deliberately echoing the \"Plan de Ayala\" of Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata. At Easter, the marchers arrived in Sacramento, where over 8,000 people amassed in front of the state capitol. Chavez briefly addressed the crowd.\nDuring the march, Chavez had been approached by Schenley's lawyer, Sidney Korshak. They agreed to contract negotiations within 60 days. Chavez then declared an end to the Schenley boycott; instead, the movement would switch the boycott to the DiGiorgio Corporation, a major Delano land owner. DiGiorgio then called an election among their vineyard workers, hoping to challenge the NFWA's influence. A more conservative union, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, was competing against the NFWA in the DiGiorgio workers' election. After DiGiorgio altered the terms of the election to benefit a Teamster victory, Chavez removed the NFWA from the ballot and urged his supporters to abstain. When the vote took place in June 1966, nearly half of eligible workers abstained, allowing a Teamster victory. Chavez then appealed to Pat Brown, the Governor of California, to intervene. Brown agreed, wanting the endorsement of the Mexican American Political Association. He declared the DiGiorgio election invalid and called for an August rerun to be supervised by the American Arbitration Association. On September 1, Chavez's union was declared the victor in the second election. DiGiorgio subsequently largely halted grape production in Delano. The focus then shifted to Giumarra, the largest grape grower in the San Joaquin Valley. In August 1967, Chavez announced a strike against them followed by a boycott of their grapes.\nAn agreement was reached that Chavez's NFWA would merge with the AWOC, resulting in a new United Farm Workers Organizing Committee (UFWOC). AWOC's Larry Itliong became the new group's assistant director, although soon felt marginalized by Chavez. UFWOC was also made an organizing committee of the AFL-CIO; this ensured that it would become a formal part of the U.S. labor movement and would receive a monthly subsidy. Not all of Chavez's staff agreed with the merger; many of its more left-wing members mistrusted the growing links with organized labor, particularly due to the AFL-CIO's anti-communist views. The UFWOC was plagued by ethnic divisions between its Filipino and Mexican members, although it continued to attract new volunteers. The majority of the volunteers were whites brought into the movement via left-wing and religious groups, or as part of social service internships. Chavez brought new people, such as LeRoy Chatfield, Marshall Ganz, and the lawyer Jerry Cohen, into his inner circle. His old friend Fred Ross had also joined. Soon, the secretary\u2013treasurer Antonio Orendain was left as the only Mexican migrant in the union's senior ranks.\nIn June 1967, Chavez launched his first purge of the union to remove those he deemed disruptive or disloyal to his leadership. His cover story was that he wanted to eject members of the Communist Party USA and related far-left groups, although the FBI's report at the time found no evidence of communist infiltration of the union. Some longstanding members, such as Esher, left because they disapproved of these purges. Tensions between Chavez and the Teatro had been building for some time; the Teatro's members were among those highly critical of the union's new links with the AFL-CIO. Chavez was concerned that the Teatro had become a rival to his prominent standing in the movement and was questioning his actions. Chavez asked the Teatro to disband, at which it split from the union and went on a tour of the U.S.\n\nForty Acres and public fasts: 1967\u20131968\nThe union purchased land known as The Forty Acres for their new headquarters. Chavez hoped for it to be a \"spiritual\" center where union members would relax; he designed it to have a swimming pool, a chapel, a market, and a gas station, as well as gardens with outdoor sculptures. He wanted the main building to be decorated inside with Gandhi quotations in English and Spanish. Meanwhile, Chavez was increasingly concerned that his supporters might turn to violence. Members had engaged in the destruction of property, something they regarded as not breaching the movement's ethos on non-violence. Chavez's cousin Manuel had tampered with refrigerator units on trains, so that grapes being shipped out of Delano spoiled before reaching their destination; Chavez noted that \"He's done all the dirty work for the union. There's a lot of fucking dirty work, and he did it all.\" In February 1968, the Giumarra company obtained a contempt citation against the union, claiming that its members had used threatening and intimidating behavior against its employees and had placed roofing nails at the entrances to its ranches.\nIn February 1968, Chavez began a fast; he publicly stated that in doing so he was reaffirming his commitment to peaceful protest and presented it as a form of penance. He stated that he would remain at Forty Acres for the duration of his fast, which at this point had only a gas station there. Many members of the union were critical of what they saw as a stunt; Itliong was annoyed that Chavez had not consulted the union's board before making his declaration. The union introduced a motion urging Chavez to cancel his plan, although this failed. Father Mark Day announced that a Mass would be held every night at Forty Acres. These attracted many of Chavez's supporters, with the gas station decorated as an impromptu shrine. Sympathetic Protestant clergy and Jewish rabbis also spoke at these Masses. After three weeks, Chavez's doctors urged him to end the fast. He agreed to do so at a public event on March 10. He invited Robert Kennedy to be the guest of honor at this event. Kennedy arrived at the event, which was attended by thousands of observers as well as the national press, and there they shared bread.\n\nNot long after, Kennedy announced his candidacy to be the Democratic Party's next presidential candidate. He asked Chavez to run as a delegate in the California primary. Throughout May, Chavez traveled across California, urging farmworkers and registered Democrats to back Kennedy. His activism was a contributing factor to Kennedy's victory in that state. It was at the victory celebration in Los Angeles, an event attended by Chavez, that Kennedy was assassinated on June 5. Chavez then attended Kennedy's New York funeral as a pallbearer. Kennedy's assassination came two months after that of Martin Luther King, generating growing concerns among the union that Chavez would also be targeted by those who opposed him.\nIn May, Chavez appeared on the Today television show and announced a boycott of all grapes produced in California. The boycotters' message was that consumers should avoid buying California grapes so that farmworkers would get better wages and working conditions. Supporters across the country picketed stores selling California grapes and disrupted annual meetings of several supermarket chains. Chavez hoped that by putting pressure on the supermarkets, they in turn would pressure the grape growers to give in to strikers' demands. The growers hired a public relations firm to counteract the boycott, warning stores that if they gave in to the boycott they would soon be faced with similar boycotts for many other products. The growers also turned to the newly elected Governor of California, Ronald Reagan, who in turn sought the support of the Teamsters.\nChavez's back pain worsened and in September 1968 he was hospitalized at O'Connor Hospital in San Jose. He followed this with a recuperation stay at St Anthony's Seminary in Santa Barbara. He returned home, but finding it too crowded moved in to Forty Acres. Due to a donation from the United Auto Workers, the union had erected an office and meeting hall here, with a trailer being used as a medical clinic; it was still far from Chavez's original vision. He used his image of physical suffering as a tactic in his cause, although some of his inner circle thought his pain to be at least partially psychosomatic. By 1968, Chavez was a national celebrity. Journalists increasingly approached him for interviews; he granted particularly close access to Peter Matthiessen and Jacques E. Levy, both of whom wrote favorable books about him. In July 1969, Chavez's portrait appeared on the front of Time magazine. Within the union, personal loyalty to Chavez became increasingly important; tensions between him and Itliong grew.\n\nEnd of the Grape Strike: 1969\u20131970\nIn March 1969, the doctor Janet Travell visited Chavez and determined that fused vertebrae were the source of his back pain. She prescribed various exercises and other treatments which he found eased his pain. Between September and December, Chavez traveled the country in a Winnebago speaking at dozens of fundraisers and rallies for the grape boycott. At a speech in Washington D.C., he came out publicly against U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, a topic he had previously avoided speaking on, because his son Fernando had been arrested as a conscientious objector.\nIn the late 1970s, Chavez also sought to advance his control over the California Rural Legal Assistance (CRLA), a group which advocated for farmworkers. Chavez demanded that the CRLA make its staff available for union work and that it would allow the union's attorneys to decide which cases the CRLA would pursue. Under the leadership of Cruz Reynoso, a former Chavez ally, the CRLA refused. Pawel believed that these attempts reflected Chavez's desire to be seen as the only voice for farmworkers.\nChavez negotiated with Lionel Steinberg, a grape grower in the Coachella area. They signed contracts allowing Steinberg's products to be sold with a union logo on them, indicating that they would be exempt from the boycott. Other Coachella growers regarded Steinberg as a traitor for negotiating with Chavez but ultimately followed suit, resulting in contracts being signed with the union. In July 1969, the Delano growers agreed to negotiate. Chavez insisted that their negotiations also cover issues at the Delano High School, where several pupils, including his own daughter Eloise, had been suspended or otherwise disciplined for protesting in support of the boycott. On July 29, 1970, the Delano growers signed contracts with the union at the Forty Acres Hall, in front of press. These contracts agreed to wage rises for pickers, the introduction of a health plan, and new safety measures regarding the use of pesticides on the crop.\n\nLater activism\nSalinas Lettuce Strike: 1970\u20131971\nIn July 1970, the Grower-Shipper Association representing lettuce growing companies in California's Salinas Valley renegotiated its contracts with the Teamsters, allowing the latter union to represent their employees. Chavez was angry at this, traveling to Salinas to talk with the lettuce cutters, many of whom were dissatisfied with the way that the Teamsters represented them. In August, thousands of cutters marched into Salinas, converging at Hartnell College where Chavez addressed them. Rallying against the Teamsters, he emphasized that their union was run by white people, in contrast to the largely non-white makeup of the lettuce cutters. There, the cutters voted to go on strike. Over the coming days, many of them joined the UFW. Chavez decided that the strike should initially target the valley's largest lettuce grower, Interharvest, which was owned by the United Fruit Company. Seeking to avoid industrial action, the Teamsters set up a meeting with Chavez, where they eventually reached an agreement. The Teamsters agreed to relinquish their contracts with the Grower-Shipper Association, opening the way for the Salinas lettuce cutters to choose the UFW as their representative.\nThe Salinas lettuce growers secured a temporary restraining order preventing a strike, at which Chavez initiated another protest fast. Amid a ten-day truce, he reached an agreement with Interharvest but not the other Salinas growers. Thus, the strike against them began on August 24, when cutters started picketing the lettuce fields. Lettuce production slumped by three quarters and prices of lettuces doubled. Various restraining orders were issued against the picketers, and when they broke them they were fined; the UFW paid many of these, as well as financially supporting the strikers in other ways. This proved expensive for the union, and Chavez decided that the pickets could not be maintained. Instead he decided to switch towards a boycott of Salinas lettuce. Chavez selected the Bud Antle company as the first target of the boycott campaign.\nBud Antle secured an injunction legally preventing a boycott against them, but Chavez continued regardless. Due to this, Chavez was charged, found guilty of contempt of court, and sentenced to ten days imprisonment in the Monterey County jail. During Chavez's imprisonment, supporters held a round-the-clock vigil outside the jail. Among those who visited him were Martin Luther King's widow Coretta Scott King, and Robert Kennedy's widow, Ethel Kennedy. She took part in a rally which included a Roman Catholic Mass; it was opposed by a group of local counter-protesters who opposed the concentration of leftist activism in their community. These events attracted national media attention. Soon after, the California Supreme Court voted to dissolve key aspects of Bud Antle's injunction and ordered Chavez's release.\nChavez wanted a more remote base for his movement than Forty Acres, especially one where he could experiment with his ideas about communal living. To this end, the Hollywood movie producer Edward Lewis, a wealthy supporter of Chavez's, fronted the purchase of an old tuberculosis sanatorium in Keene, along the foothills of the Tehachapi Mountains, for the union. Chavez named this new base Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Reina de la Paz (\"Our Lady Queen of Peace\"), although it became commonly known just as \"La Paz\". Renovating the existing buildings, he invited various families to come and live there. In creating this commune, he drew on Gandhi's experiments with ashrams in India; he envisioned it as a retreat center where workers could come for three day retreats modeled on the Roman Catholic cursillo. La Paz became the union's new headquarters, something that various backers and funders were critical of due to its remote location; Chavez said that this was necessary for his security, particularly following allegations of a plot against his life. At night, the perimeter of the commune was patrolled by armed guards. The organization at La Paz was often chaotic, with frustrated detractors in the movement referring to it as \"Magic Mountain\". Amid his growing frustrations with Chavez's leadership, Itliong resigned in October 1971.\n\nExpanding beyond California: 1972\nArizona became the first state to pass a bill that was designed to keep the UFW out of their state; this would criminalize boycotts and make union elections among farm-workers almost impossible. In response, Chavez drove to Arizona and demanded a meeting with Governor Jack Williams, who refused. They subsequently launched a campaign to gain a recall election to remove Williams from office. This started the UFW's first major farm-worker campaign outside California. Farmworkers rallied outside Williams' office while Chavez embarked on a fast in the Santa Rita Center, a hall used by a local Chicano group. On the nineteenth day of his fast, Chavez was hospitalized. He then broke the fast at a memorial Mass on the anniversary of Robert Kennedy's death, where he was joined by the folk singer Joan Baez. It was during the Arizona campaign that the UFW started using the slogan \"Si Se Puede\" (\"It Can be Done\"), which subsequently became closely associated with it.\nChavez increasingly pushed for the UFW to become a national organization, with a token presence being established in Washington State, Oregon, Idaho, Texas, and Florida. Parts of the union expressed concern that it was now overstretching its resources. Chavez also pushed for the California Migrant Ministry, which supported the UFW, to transform into a National Farm Worker Ministry (NFWM), insisting that the UFW should have the power to veto decisions made by the NFWM.\nAt the AFL-CIO's request, Chavez had suspended the Salinas lettuce boycott, but prepared to relaunch it eight months later as the growers had only conceded to one of their demands. Tensions grew between the UFW and AFL-CIO, with the latter's president George Meany concerned that if the UFW broke the law by extending its boycott to cover supermarket chains then the AFL-CIO could be held liable. As a result, Chavez formally requested a charter so that the UFW could become an independently chartered union separate from the AFL-CIO; he was loath to do so as it meant losing the AFL-CIO's subsidy.\nWhile Chavez had been focusing on Salinas, his brother Richard had been tasked with overseeing the UFW's activities in Delano. In early 1972, Richard visited Chavez and confronted him about the problems in Delano, telling him that the union was losing support among farmworkers and that they were in danger of losing the contracts when they came up for renewal. In Richard's opinion, Chavez was losing touch with the union's membership. There was anger that members were expected to pay monthly dues to the union when their work was usually seasonal; there was also frustration at the union's $1-a-week voluntary fund to support the Salinas strikers. Part of the membership thought that Chavez's new isolation at La Paz was leading him to take decisions unpopular with the farmworkers. There were concerns about the inept and inexperienced volunteers, mostly English-speaking European-Americans, who were running the UFW's hiring halls; growers were complaining that these volunteers were often hostile and uncooperative. Union branches had been ordering members to miss work to engage in political rallies and Salinas picket lines, further angering growers. Chavez responded to these criticisms by reassigning his brother away from Delano. In late 1972, Richard and Huerta, his partner at the time, briefly left the UFW in frustration with Chavez's leadership. Other senior members continued to warn Chavez about the same issues that Richard did, but Chavez dismissed their concerns as grower propaganda.\n\nCalifornia growers then organized a ballot on Proposition 22 for November 1972 which would ban boycott campaigns in the state. Chavez tasked LeRoy Chatfield with running the campaign against it; at the ballot, Proposition 22 lost by 58 percent to 42 percent.\nIn April 1973, the UFW's contact with grape growers in the Delano area expired. At this, Chavez called a strike in the Coachella Valley. The Teamsters union saw this as an opportunity to replace the UFW in representing the region's farmworkers. The Teamsters organized counter-protests; their picketers were often armed and violent clashes between members of the two unions broke out. The UFW used these instances of Teamster violence to rally public support for their cause. The AFL-CIO was concerned by this clash between unions, and Meany struck a deal with Chavez that they would provide the UFW with renewed financial support if it pushed for state legislation to govern the rights of farmworkers to organize. Chavez agreed; although he did not want such a law and he thought that Governor Reagan would never agree to it anyway. The AFL-CIO gave the UFW $1.6 million, allowing the latter to pay Salinas picketers $75 and later $90 a week.\nAmid the Delano strike, one of the UFW strikers, the Yemeni migrant Nagi Moshin Daifullah, died after an altercation with a police officer breaking up a bar-room fight. The UFW portrayed Daifullah as a martyr for the cause and over 5000 people marched at his funeral, with Chavez fasting for three days. Chavez then called off the Denalo strike, stating that he would do so until the federal government guaranteed the safety of UFW protesters; the government believed that this was a cover to conceal the financial problems that the strike was causing the UFW. By this point, the UFW had lost much of its membership, and most of its California contracts, to the Teamsters. Many farmworkers found that while the Teamsters appeared less interested in workers' rights, they did not expect their employees to spend their weekends on political campaigns and boycotts as the UFW did.\n\nImmigration and legislative campaigns: 1973\u20131975\nIn September 1973, the UFW's first constitutional convention was held in Fresno, representing the final step in the organization becoming a full union. A new constitution was announced that gave the group's president, a post occupied by Chavez, significant powers; he feared that greater democracy would paralyze the group. At the convention, the UFW agreed to scrap monthly membership fees in favor of charging members 2 percent of their annual income. It also announced that volunteers who had worked for the UFW for more than six months could become members with voting rights. Previously, membership had been restricted primarily to farmworkers. The new executive committee, which included Huerta and Richard Chavez, was racially mixed, although some members expressed dissatisfaction that it did not contain more Mexican Americans.  By 1974, the UFW was again broke and its boycott was floundering. That year, The New York Times Magazine opened with a headline: \"Is Chavez Beaten?\". Chavez flew to Europe to urge the unions there to block the imported goods that the UFW were sending there. He traveled through London, Oslo, Stockholm, Geneva, Hamburg, Copenhagen, Brussels, and Paris, although he found that the unions were cautious about joining his campaign. In Rome, he met with Pope Paul VI, who commended his activism.\nChavez increasingly blamed the failure of the UFW strike on illegal immigrants who were brought in as strikebreakers. He made the unsubstantiated claim that the CIA was involved in part of a conspiracy to bring illegal migrants into the country so that they could undermine his union. He launched the \"Illegals Campaign\" to identify illegal migrants so that they could be deported, appointing Liza Hirsch to oversee the campaign. In Chavez's view, \"if we can get the illegals out of California, we will win the strike overnight.\" This was a reiteration of an early view he expressed concerning the problems the UFW boycott faced in 1972. Chavez believed that any strike undertaken by agricultural workers could be undermined by \"wetbacks\" and \"illegal immigrants\". Huerta urged him not to refer to migrants who had come to the U.S. illegally as \"illegals\" but Chavez refused, stating: \"a spade's a spade.\" Some UFW field offices refused to collaborate with the campaign, and the National Lawyers Guild (NLG) refused to allow its interns to work on it, at which Chavez cut the UFW's links with the NLG.\n\nWhile Chavez had been in Europe, his cousin Manuel Chavez had established a UFW patrol, or \"wet line\", along Arizona's border with Mexico to stop illegal migrants crossing into the United States. There were rumors that this patrol was employing violence against these migrants, beating and robbing them and in one case castrating a man. These allegations soon appeared in the local press. A Mexican investigation determined that the UFW had bribed San Luis city officials to prevent them from interfering in these activities along the border. A Mexican union, the Confederation of Mexican Workers, broke its links with the UFW over the issue. Chavez dismissed the reports of violence as the smears of paid provocateurs, a claim which many of his supporters accepted. Chavez protected Manuel, while the executive board kept silent on his activities, regarding him as useful. The Chicano activist Bert Corona staged a protest against the UFW wet line, at which Chavez directed Jerry Cohen to launch an investigation into the funding of Corona's group.\nIn 1974, Chavez proposed the idea of a Poor People's Union with which he could reach out to poor white communities in the San Joaquin Valley who were largely hostile to the UFW. Meanwhile, the UFW announced that it would launch a boycott of the Gallo Wine company. In February 1975, the UFW organized a four-day march from San Francisco to the Gallo headquarters in Modesto, where a crowd of around 10,000 protesters amassed. The Modesto march had been a means of trying to rekindle the successes of the late 1960s and a public display of strength despite the setbacks that the UFW had experienced.\nIn November 1974, the Democratic Party's candidate, the modern liberal Jerry Brown, was elected governor of California. At this point, farm-worker's rights took center stage in the state's political agenda. Chavez met with Brown and together they developed a strategy: Brown would introduce a bill to improve farmworkers' rights, at which the UFW would support a more radical alternative. Brown would then negotiate a law with other stakeholders that included all the UFW's bottom lines. The purpose of this law would be to guarantee farmworkers the right to a secret ballot in which they could decide which union, if any, should represent them in their negotiations with their employer. Brown signed the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act (ALRA) into law in June 1975. This was widely seen as a UFW victory, as California now had the most favorable labor bill in the country. Chavez nevertheless worried that it would kill the movement's spirit, stating that the cause would now lose \"the essential fight of recognition, which is the one that appeals to the human mind and the heart\", instead focusing on more prosaic issues such as wages and benefits.\n\nProposition 14: 1976\u20131977\nThe ALRA law created a state agency, the California Agricultural Labor Relations Board (ALRB), to oversee union elections among farmworkers. Brown appointed a five-person board to lead the ALRB which was sympathetic to Chavez; it included the former UFW official LeRoy Chatfield. As the UFW prepared for the elections in the fields, Chavez organized a \"1000 mile march\" from the San Diego border up the coast in July 1975. During the march, he stopped to attend the second UFW convention. For the campaign, the UFW hired 500 organizers, many of them farmworkers. The UFW won more elections than it lost, although in instances where it went head-to-head with the Teamsters, the latter beat the UFW. This indicated that the UFW's greatest strengths were among vegetable and citrus growers, rather than in their original heartlands of the Delano vineyards. The Teamster victories in the Delano vineyards angered Chavez, who insisted that there had not been free elections there. Chavez criticised the ALRB and launched a targeted campaign against Walter Kintz, the ALRB's general counsel, demanding his resignation. He also put pressure on Governor Brown to remove Kintz.\nUFW organizers moved to follow their electoral victories by signing contracts with the growers; the UFW needed these contracts to stabilize its finances. Meanwhile, to develop the UFW's administration, Chavez hired the management consultant Crosby Milne, whose ideas led to a restructuring of the union. These reforms further centralized the union's powers among the executive committee. The changes involved decision-making powers being delegated from Chavez to the department heads, although Chavez\u2014who liked to oversee everything personally\u2014found this difficult to adhere to in practice. As part of these reforms, Chavez continued to call on the union's leaders to all relocate to La Paz, which many were reluctant to do. In July 1976, Chavez traveled to New York to attend the Democratic Party's National Congress, at which he gave a speech nominating Brown as the party's presidential candidate. Brown would come third in the contest, which would be won by Jimmy Carter. Carter went on to win the 1976 election, initiating an administration that was keen to fund UFW projects.\nIn 1976, the ALRB ran out of its budgeted money for the year. The California legislature refused to allocate more money, so the ALRB closed shop for the year. Seeking to get the farmworkers' rights introduced by ALRA enshrined in California's constitution, in early 1976 UFW activists put forward the idea of Proposition 14, which would go forward to the electorate later that year. Chavez thought that Proposition 14 had little chance of being passed by the electorate and was concerned that devoting its resources to the campaign would be financially costly for the UFW.  Brown also warned them not to, arguing that it would backfire on farmworkers by polarizing communities. Despite these concerns, Fred Ross urged the union to take on the issue, and after much debate, the UFW's executive board voted to involve itself in the 'vote yes' campaign on Proposition 14. Growers responded with a well-funded multi-media campaign that emphasized the claim that the measure would give unions the right to trespass on private property. When it went to the electorate in November 1976, Proposition 14 was defeated by a measure of two-to-one. Although this defeat had little serious impact on the UFW, Chavez took it as a very public rejection of him personally.\nChavez blamed the defeat on the UFW's national boycott director, Nick Jones, who had been the only staff member to publicly voice disquiet over the Proposition 14 campaign. He claimed that Jones and the New York boycott director, Charlie March, had been part of a far-left conspiracy to undermine the UFW. Under pressure, in November 1976, Jones resigned; in a letter to the executive board he stated that he was \"deeply concerned\" about the direction in which Chavez was taking the union. Chavez also fired Joe Smith, the editor of El Macriado, after accusing him of deliberately undermining the newspaper. He then ordered Ross and Ganz to interrogate everyone who worked on the campaign, ostensibly to decide on new assignments but also to route out alleged malcontents, agitators, and spies. Many of those involved in running the UFW's boycott expressed concerns about a McCarthyite-style atmosphere developing within the union, and Chavez's purge attracted press attention. As the criticisms of his leadership intensified, Chavez responded with further purges, inspired by those in China's Cultural Revolution. He became convinced that there was a far-left conspiracy, whose members he called the \"assholes\" or \"them\", who were trying to undermine the UFW. At a La Paz meeting in April 1977, later called \"the Monday Night Massacre,\" Chavez called together a range of individuals whom he denounced as malcontents or spies. They were verbally abused by members of the executive board and ejected from the community. He later accused Philip Vera Cruz, the oldest member of the executive board, of also being part of the conspiracy, and forced him out.\nChavez reversed many of the changes he had implemented under Milne's guidance, with executive board members being reassigned to cover geographic areas rather than having union-wide responsibilities. Milne, who had been living at La Paz, soon left, with Chavez later alleging he had been part of a conspiracy against the union. UFW had also entered into a negotiation with the Teamsters union, a process led by Cohen. The two unions reached an agreement by which the UFW would cease bringing litigation against the Teamsters if the latter ceased operating among farm-workers altogether. This left the UFW as the only dominant union among the farmworkers. The Teamsters agreed because farmworkers were a marginal group for them; their typically low incomes also meant that farmworkers did not generate sufficient funds for the union to warrant its ongoing and costly clashes with the UFW.\n\nLinks with Synanon and Ferdinand Marcos: 1977\nChavez told the executive committee that radical change was necessary in the UFW; he stated that they could be either a union or a movement, but not both. If the former, they would have to start paying wages to their staff rather than relying on volunteers, which at that time they were not in a financial position to do. He instead urged them to become a movement, which he argued meant establishing communal settlements for members, drawing on a Californian religious organization, Synanon, as an exemplar. Chavez had become increasingly interested in Synanon, a drug-treatment organization that had declared itself a religion in 1975 and which operated out of a compound east of Fresno. He admired Synanon's leader Charles Dederich, and the way that the latter controlled his planned community. In Chavez's opinion, Dederich was \"a genius in terms of people\".\nIn February 1977, Chavez took the UFW's executive board on a visit to the Synanon compound. There, they took part in a therapy system based on Dederich's own process, \"the Game,\" as part of which each \"player\" was singled out in turn to receive harsh, profanity-laced criticism from the rest of the community. Dederich had told Chavez that \"the Game\" was key to reshaping the UFW, and the latter decided that he wanted everyone at La Paz to play it. He received tacit agreement from the executive board, although some of its members privately opposed the measure. The Game took place at La Paz on Sunday mornings and Wednesday evenings, and at its height, about 100 people were taking part in it each week. There it was used to shape behavior and punish nonconformity. Many individuals dreaded the humiliation it involved, disliked the obscenities that were part of it, and found going through it to be a traumatic experience. Chavez remained enthusiastic about the Game, calling it \"a good tool to fine-tune the union\". Many of those close to Chavez, including his wife and Richard Chavez, refused to take part. The farmworkers were not informed about the Game. Various long-term supporters of the UFW, including various clerical figures, visited La Paz at this time and left alarmed by how it had changed.\nSynanon provided the UFW with $100,000 worth of cars and materials; building links with Chavez's movement burnished Dederich's reputation with rich liberals who were among Synanon's core constituency. Dederich suggested that Synanon and the UFW establish a joint communal farm, and although the option was explored, it did not materialize. Following Dederich's advice, Chavez began grooming young people who had grown up in the movement to remain committed to him and his ideals. He created a curriculum for them to follow, which included the Game. Whereas Chavez had previously refused to accept government money, he now applied for over $500,000 in grants for a school and other projects. Formal celebrations and group rituals became an important part of life at La Paz, while Chavez also declared that on Saturday mornings all residents of La Paz should work in the vegetable and flower gardens to improve sociability. A rule was passed that everyone at La Paz had to wear a UFW button at all times on penalty of a fine. After attending a course in Los Angeles, Chavez began claiming that he could heal people by laying on his hands.\n\nIn the field elections, the UFW was largely rebuffed by Filipino-American workers. Seeking to remedy this, in 1977 Chavez traveled to the Philippines as the guest of its president, Ferdinand Marcos. There, he was treated as a high-ranking dignitary, and received both an award from Marcos and an honorary doctorate from the Far Eastern University in Manila. He then spoke to a reporter from The Washington Post where he spoke positively about Marcos' introduction of martial law. This generated outcry in the U.S., especially among religious groups, who argued that Chavez was overlooking the human rights abuses taking place under Marcos' administration. Chavez then organized an event on Delano for five senior Filipino government officially to speak to an assembled audience. The incident eroded support among religious organizations, a key constituency for Chavez and the UFW.\nTime magazine published a story reporting on violence and child abuse at Synanon, which it termed a \"kooky cult\". Synanon launched a boycott of Time in response, with Chavez urging the UFW to support it, stating that they should assist their friends and help protect religious freedom. Los Angeles police then raided Synanon's compound and revealed evidence that Dederich had sanctioned the use of violence against the group's critics and ex-members; several senior members were also found guilty of murdering a lawyer representing ex-Synanon members. Shortly after, the Peoples Temple run by the civil rights activist Jim Jones, a group which had been closely linked with California's leftist movement, committed mass suicide at their Jonestown community. A Democratic assemblyman soon issued a press release comparing the cult surrounding Chavez to the Peoples Temple. The UFW stopped using the Game in response to these developments; Chavez's calls for it to resume were rejected by other senior members.\nThe UFW continued to rely on voluntary labor, only paying a small number of employees, such as lawyers. When the union's lawyers, who were paid, asked for a raise, it generated a major debate among the executive committee. Chavez framed the issue along the lines of whether the UFW should start paying wages to everyone or instead continue to rely on volunteers. The executive committee split largely on generational lines, with older members backing Chavez's desire to remain a voluntary organization, and this attitude narrowly prevailed. Medina, one of only two former farmworkers on the board, resigned over the issue. Drake also resigned.\nHalf of the lawyers left straight away, and the others in the coming weeks as the UFW switched to a voluntary legal department; the new volunteers were largely inexperienced. It was also in 1977 that the UFW declared that contributions to the union's political fund would become mandatory for members; this was then used to support political groups and candidates considered sympathetic to the UFW's interests.\n\nLater life\nGrowing schisms: 1978\u20131982\nIn June 1978, Chavez joined a picket in Yuma as part of his cousin Manuel's Arizona melon strike. This broke an injunction and Chavez was thrown into the county jail for a night. By 1978, there was growing anger at the UFW among vegetable workers; they were frustrated by its incompetency, especially in the running of its medical plan. In the 22 farmworker elections that took place between June and September 1978, the UFW lost two-thirds. To stop the loss of its contracts and members, Chavez launched his Plan de Flote, an initiative to regain the trust of the vegetable pickers. Chavez organized a new strike over wages, hoping that salary increases would stem the UFW's losses; the union made its wage demands in January 1979, days after its contracts had expired. Eleven lettuce growers in the Salinas and Imperial Valleys were included in the strike, which caused lettuce prices to soar.\nDuring the strike, the picketers trespassed on the Mario Saikhon company fields and attempted to drive away those still working. The foreman and other employees opened fire and one picketer, Rufino Contreras, was killed. Chavez urged the strikers not to resort to violence and with Contreras' father led a three-mile candlelit funerary procession, attended by 7000 people. In June, Ganz and other strike organizers planned a show of strength whereby strikers rushed onto the Salinas field to cause disruption. This generated violent clashes; several people sustained stab wounds and 75 were arrested. Vegetable growers accused Chavez of terrorism over the incident; Chavez criticized Ganz for organizing this without his approval. He then led a 12-day march from San Francisco to San Jose, beginning a fast on the sixth day. Arriving in Salinas, he met with strike leaders at a UFW convention. He argued that the strike was proving too costly for the UFW\u2014it cost the union between $300,000 and $400,000 a month\u2014and that they should end the strike and switch to a boycott campaign. The strike leaders rejected these suggestions. To end the strike, in August and September, several growers signed contracts with the UFW but many held out and the union was broke. Chavez continued arguing for a boycott, suggesting that the union could use alcoholics from the cities to run the boycott campaign, an idea most of the executive board rejected.\nUnder the new contracts, the growers agreed to pay for paid workers' representatives whose job it would be to ensure a smooth relationship between the growers and the UFW. Chavez brought these paid representatives to La Paz for a five-day training session in May 1980. Ganz, who was becoming increasingly distant from Chavez, helped tutor them. Chavez called all staff to a meeting at La Paz in May 1981, where he again insisted that the UFW was being infiltrated by spies seeking to undermine it and overthrow him. He arranged for more of his loyalists to be put on the executive board, which now had no farmworkers sitting on it. At the UFW's Fresno convention in September 1981, the paid representatives nominated some of their own choices, rather than Chavez's, to go on the board. Chavez's supporters responded with leaflets claiming that the paid representatives were puppets of \"the two Jews\", Ganz and Cohen, who were trying to undermine the union. This brought allegations of antisemitism against Chavez. Seeking to undermine the paid representatives, Chavez proposed a measure that if 8% of workers at a ranch signed a petition, the representatives of that ranch would be obliged to vote for Chavez's chosen candidates. The measure passed.\n\nBy October, all of those who had opposed Chavez's choices at the convention had been fired. They responded by launching a fast in protest outside the UFW's Salinas office. Nine of them then sued Chavez in a federal court, claiming that he had no right to fire them from positions that they had been elected to represent by their peers in the fields. Chavez responded with a counter-suit, suing them for libel and slander. He acknowledged to a reporter that in doing so, he was trying to intimidate the protester's lawyer, something which brought negative publicity for the UFW. One of the protesters, Chava Bustamante, got work with the California Rural Legal Assistance group, at which the UFW began picketing their offices, trying to get Bustamante fired. In court, Chavez denied that the paid representatives were ever elected, alleging that they were appointed by him personally, but produced no evidence to support this claim. The US District Court Judge William Ingram rejected Chavez's argument, ruling that the sacking of the paid representatives had been unlawful. The UFW appealed the ruling, which dragged out for years, until the paid representatives ran out of funds to continue.\nOpposition to Chavez's hostility to illegal migrants led senior UFW members in Texas and Arizona to break from the union and form their own groups, such as the Texas Farm Workers Union and the Maricopa County Organizing Project. Chavez and his cousin Manuel went to Texas to try and rally opposition to the schism. Manuel also went to Arizona, where he introduced a range of measures to undermine the new group. This led to the investigative journalist Tom Barry looking into Manuel's activities. It was revealed that under a pseudonym he had become a melon grower in Mexico, and that he was initiating strikes among U.S. melon pickers as a means of improving the market for his own produce. The UFW's reputation was further damaged after the magazine Reason exposed that the union had improperly spent nearly $1 million in federal funds. Federal and national investigations followed, confirming these allegations. The government asked the UFW to return over $250,000 in funds while the Internal Revenue Service ruled that the union owed $390,000 in back social security and federal unemployment taxes.\nIn 1982, the UFW held a celebration of the twentieth anniversary of its first convention at San Jose. It was in October that year that Chavez's father died, with the funeral being held in San Jose. Chavez was also involving himself in a broader range of leftist events. He co-chaired Tom Hayden and Jane Fonda's fund-raising dinner for their Campaign for Economic Democracy. In the summer of 1982 he also appeared at Peace Sunday, an anti-nuclear event. The UFW had established itself as one of the largest political donors in California. Its political donations were often concealed from the public, funneled through intermediary committees. It donated thousands of dollars to Howard Berman's campaign to unseat Leo McCarthy as the Speaker of the California State Assembly because of McCarthy's role in defeating Proposition 14. Many Democrats feared that Berman would be beholden to Chavez and so backed Willie Brown, who won. The UFW subsequently also donated to Willie Brown.\n\nThe Chicano Lobby and commercial activities: 1983\u20131989\nThe UFW's membership, and the subsequent membership dues they paid, continued to decline. In January 1983, UFW contracts covered 30,000 jobs but by January 1986 this had fallen to 15,000. In 1982, the dues that membership brought in were $2.9 million although this had fallen to $1 million three years later. By the early 1980s, there was a burgeoning Latino middle-class in the U.S. Although Chavez hated the aspirational approach that had encouraged working-class Latinos to become middle-class, he recognized that this offered the UFW a wider support base. At the 1983 UFW convention, he announced the formation of a new non-profit organization, the Chicano Lobby. At the Lobby's launch, addresses were given by the San Antonio Mayor Henry Cisneros and the newly elected president of the Mexican American Political Association, Chavez's eldest son Fernando. To cope with its declining membership, the UFW sought to build its political influence. In November 1984, Chavez gave a speech to the Commonwealth Club of California. The UFW launched a print shop, with politicians who were eager to court the Latino vote increasingly used.\nChavez launched a boycott of grapes and Red Coach Lettuce because their parent company, Bruce Church, had refused to sign a contract with the UFW. Chavez launched a boycott of Lucky, a California supermarket chain. His strategy was to convince the supermarket that the UFW could damage its patronage among Latinos. Chavez had observed that the Christian Right was beginning to use new computer technologies to reach potential supporters and decided that the UFW should do the same. Through this, they were better able to target specific groups whom they regarded as sympathetic to their cause: Hispanics, middle-class African Americans, and liberal professionals living in the major cities. As part of its boycott, the UFW also bought television commercials, which it used to help raise money.\nFrom the mid-1980s, Chavez increasingly focused the UFW's campaigns on opposing the use of pesticides in the fields, which he argued posed a danger both to farmworkers and to consumers. The UFW raised over $100,000, as well as donated equipment, to launch its own pesticide research lab, but this never opened. In his anti-pesticide campaigns he gained support from Ralph Nader. Chavez linked this approach in with the ongoing boycott of Bruce Church, arguing that if consumers boycotted the company's products, the growers would stop using pesticides. The UFW claimed that the high rates of childhood cancer in McFarland represented evidence of how pesticides impacted humans; they used footage of some of these children in a 17-minute video, The Wrath of Grapes. Many of the parents were angered and several sued the UFW, claiming that the union was exploiting their children for its own agenda. UFW activists also turned up at the funeral procession of a 14-year old who had died from cancer, where they carried union flags; the child's furious mother demanded that they leave.\nIn 1982, Jerry Brown ceased to be governor of California. He was replaced by the Republican George Deukmejian, who had the backing of the state's growers; under Deukmejian, the ALRB's influence eroded. In 1987, the UFW was found liable for $1.7 million in damages to the Maggio company for the illegal actions that the union carried out against it during their 1979 strike. As the UFW's boycott of Bruce Church products failed to gain traction, in July 1988 Chavez launched another public fast at Forty Acres. Three of Robert Kennedy's children visited, generating media attention for the fast. After 19 days, Chavez broke the fast at a ceremony attended by the Democratic politician Jesse Jackson. The fast was followed by further purges at La Paz as Chavez accused more people of being saboteurs. Hartmire was among those pushed out, resigning in January 1989. Some of those at La Paz left before Chavez could target them, and the commune became increasingly depopulated. Chavez meanwhile continued to receive awards and honors. In November 1989, the Mexican government awarded him the Order of the Aztec Eagle, during which he had a private audience with Mexican President Carlos Salinas. In October 1990, Coachella became the first district to name a school after Chavez; he attended the dedication ceremony.\nWith membership dues declining, the UFW increasingly turned to commercial activities as a means of raising funds. It began marketing UFW branded merchandise through El Taller Grafico Speciality Advertising (ETG), which had Chavez as its chair. Chavez also set himself up as a housing developer, working in partnership with the Fresno businessman Celestino Aguilar. Together they bought properties undergoing foreclosure, renovated them, before selling them on. They ultimately moved from foreclosures to high-end custom built houses and subsidized apartment blocks. To conceal the UFW's involvement in these projects, Chavez and Aguilar formed the company American Liberty Investments. They also established the Ideal Minimart Corporation, which built two strip malls and operated a check-cashing store. Richard's company, Bonita Construction, was hired for some of the work. The Fresno Bee subsequently reported that most of the UFW's housing projects had been built by non-union contractors. The trade unions representing the building unions expressed outrage at the news, highlighting that they had previously given financial support to the UFW. The New Yorker later termed the incident an \"embarrassment\".\n\nFinal years: 1990\u20131993\nIn the early 1990s, the UFW continued to market Chavez as a heroic figure, especially on university and college campuses. In 1990, he appeared at 64 events, earning an average of $3,800 for each appearance. In 1991, he launched a \"Public Action Speaking Tour\" of U.S. colleges and universities. His standard speech at these events covered the problems facing farmworkers, the dangers of pesticides, the alliance of agribusiness and the Republican Party, and his view that boycotts and marches were a better means of achieving change than electoral politics.\nChavez's mother died in December 1991, aged 99. The following year, in September 1992, Chavez's mentor Ross died. Chavez gave the eulogy at his funeral. Chavez's final years saw the UFW's involvement in a legal battle with Bruce Church. The company had sued the union, claiming it libeled them and had illegally threatened supermarkets to stop them selling Red Coach lettuce. In 1988, a jury returned a $5.4 million verdict against the UFW, but this verdict was thrown out in the appeals court. The case was then remanded for trial on narrower grounds. Chavez was called to testify in front of a Yuma court in 1993. The stakes were high; a verdict against the UFW would have been financially devastating.\nDuring the case, Chavez stayed at the home of a San Luis supporter. It was there that he died in bed on April 23. He was aged 66. Chavez's body was flown to Bakersfield aboard a chartered plane. The autopsy proved inconclusive, with the family stating that he had died of natural causes. Chavez had already stipulated that he wanted his brother Richard to build his coffin, and that his funeral should take place at Forty Acres. There, his body lay in state, where tens of thousands of people visited it. A funeral procession took place in Delano, with 120 pallbearers taking turns to carry the coffin. Chavez was then buried in a private ceremony at La Paz.\n\nPersonal life\nWhen Chavez returned home from his service in the military in 1948, he married his high school sweetheart, Helen Fabela. The couple moved to San Jose, California. With his wife, he had eight children: Fernando (b.1949), Sylvia (b.1950), Linda (b.1951), Eloise (b.1952), Anna (b.1953), Paul (b.1957), Elizabeth (b.1958), and Anthony (b.1958). Helen avoided the limelight, a trait which Chavez admired. While he led the union, she focused on raising the children, cooking, and housekeeping. During the latter part of the 1970s, his infidelity with a range of women became common knowledge among senior UFW figures, who kept this knowledge quiet so as not to damage his reputation as a devoted Catholic family man. After Helen read a love letter written to Chavez by another woman, she temporarily left La Paz and lived with one of her daughters in Delano. Chavez's children resented the union and displayed little interest in it, although most ended up working for it. Of these children, Chavez's eldest son, Fernando, was the only one to graduate college; Chavez's relationship with Fernando was strained, as he was frustrated with what he saw as his son's interest in becoming middle-class.\nChavez expressed traditional views on gender roles and was little influenced by the second wave feminism that was contemporary with his activism. In his movement, men took almost all the senior roles, with women largely being confined to background roles as secretaries, nurses, or in child-care; the main exception was Huerta. Chavez had a close working relationship with Huerta. They became mutually dependent, and although she did not hesitate to raise complaints with him, she also usually deferred to him. During their working relationship, they often argued, something which intensified in the latter part of the 1970s. Huerta stated that she was Chavez's \"whipping girl\" when he was under pressure. He never had close friendships outside of his family, believing that friendships distracted from his political activism.\nPhysically, Chavez was short, and had jet black hair. He was quiet, and Bruns described him as being \"outwardly shy and unimposing\". Like many farm laborers, he experienced severe back pain throughout his life. He could be self-conscious about his lack of formal education and was uncomfortable interacting with affluent people. When speaking with reporters, he sometimes mythologized his own life story.\nChavez was not a great orator; according to Pawel, \"his power lay not in words, but in actions\". She noted that he was \"not an articulate speaker\", and similarly, Bruns observed that he \"had no special talent as a public speaker\". He was soft-spoken, and according to Pawel had an \"informal, conversational style\", and was \"good at reading people\". He was unwilling to delegate or trust others. He preferred to tackle every task personally. He was also capable of responding quickly and decisively to events.\n\nBruns described Chavez as combining a \"remarkable tenacity with a sense of serenity\". A tireless worker, he was known for often working 18 hours a day; he used to start his working day at 3.30am and would often continue working until 10pm. He stated that \"I just sleep and eat and work. I do nothing else.\" Pawel stated that as a leader, Chavez was both \"charming, attentive, and humble\" as well as being \"single-minded, demanding, and ruthless\". When he wanted to criticize one of his volunteers or staff members he usually did so in private but on occasion could berate them in a public confrontation.\nHe described his own life's work as a crusade against injustice, and displayed a commitment to self-sacrifice. Pawel thought that \"Chavez thrived on the power to help people and the way that made him feel\". Ross, who was a friend and colleague of Chavez's for many years, noted that \"He would do in thirty minutes what it would take me or somebody else thirty days\". Pawel noted that Chavez was \"openly ruthless\" in his \"drive to be the one and only farm labor leader\". He was stubborn and would rarely back down once he had taken a stance. He would not accept criticism of himself, but would deflect it.\nChavez was a Catholic whose faith strongly influenced both his social activism and his personal outlook. He rarely missed Mass and liked to open all of his meetings with either a Mass or a prayer. Privately, he also liked to meditate. In 1970, he became a vegetarian, stating that \"I wouldn't eat my dog, you know. Cows and dogs are about the same.\" As part of this diet he also shunned most dairy products except cottage cheese. He credited this diet with easing his chronic back pain. He also avoided eating processed foods. Among his favorite foods were traditional Mexican and Chinese cuisines.\nChavez had a love of the music of Duke Ellington and big band music; he enjoyed dancing. He was also an amateur photographer, and a keen gardener, making his own compost and growing vegetables. For much of his adult life he kept German shepherd dogs for personal protection; two of those he kept at La Paz were named Boycott and Huelga. Chavez preserved many of his notes, letters, the minutes of meetings, as well as tape recordings of many interviewers, and at the encouragement of Philip P. Mason donated these to the Walter P. Reuther Library, where they are kept. He disliked telephone conversations, suspecting that his phone line was bugged. He tended to see problems faced by his movement not as evidence of innocent mistakes but as deliberate sabotage.\nChavez was self-educated, with Pawel noting that he was \"disinclined to analyze information\". Once Chavez accepted an idea, he could dedicate himself to it wholeheartedly.\n\nPolitical views\nChavez described his movement as promoting \"a Christian radical philosophy\".\nAccording to Chavez biographer Roger Bruns, he \"focused the movement on the ethnic identity of Mexican Americans\" and on a \"quest for justice rooted in Catholic social teaching\". Chavez saw his fight for farmworkers' rights as a symbol for the broader cultural and ethnic struggle for Mexican Americans in the United States.\nChavez utilized a range of tactics drawing on Roman Catholic religion, including vigils, public prayers, a shrine on the back of his station wagon, and references to dead farmworkers as \"martyrs\". His point in doing so was not necessarily to proselytize, but to use the socio-political potential of Christianity for his own campaigns. Most of the farmworkers his union represented shared his Roman Catholicism and were happy to incorporate its religious practices into their marches, strikes, and other UFW activities.  Chavez called on his fellow Roman Catholics to be more consistent in standing up for the religion's values. He stated that \"in a nutshell, what do we want the Church to do? We don't ask for more cathedrals. We don't ask for bigger churches or fine gifts. We ask for its presence with us, beside us, as Christ among us. We ask the Church to sacrifice with the people for social change, for justice, and for love of brother.\" Ospino stated that \"The combination of labor organizing strategies with explicit expressions of Catholic religiosity made Chavez's approach unique\" within the U.S. labor movement, although some of his associates, non-Catholics, and other parts of the labor movement were critical of his use of Catholic elements.\nChavez abhorred poverty, regarding it as dehumanizing, and wanted to ensure a better standard of living for the poor. He was frustrated that most farmworkers appeared more interested in money and did not appreciate the values that he espoused. He was concerned that, as he had seen with the CSO, individuals moving out of poverty often adopted middle-class values; he viewed the middle classes with contempt. He recognized that union activity was not a long-term solution to poverty across society and suggested that forming co-operatives therefore might be the best solution. In Chavez's view, workers' cooperatives offered a middle ground economic choice between the failed system of capitalism and the state socialism of Marxist-Leninist countries. His son Paul recalls \"My father's basic premise was that capitalism was not going to work because it was too harsh and always took advantage of those least able to defend themselves\". He also embraced ideals about communal living, and saw the La Paz commune he established in California as a model for others to follow.\nChavez kept a large portrait of Gandhi in his office, alongside another of Martin Luther King and busts of both John F. Kennedy and Abraham Lincoln. Influenced by the ideas of Gandhi and King, Chavez emphasized non-violent confrontation as a tactic. He repeatedly referred to himself as the leader of the \"non-violent Viet Cong\", a reference to the Vietnamese Marxist-Leninist militia that the U.S. was combating in the Vietnam War. He was interested not only in Gandhi's ideas on non-violence but also in the Indian's voluntary embrace of poverty, his use of fasting, and his ideas about community. Fasting was important for Chavez. He saw it not as a tactic to pressure his opponents, but rather to motivate his supporters, keeping them focused on the cause and on avoiding violence. He also saw it as a sign of solidarity with the suffering of the people. Chavez was also interested in Gandhi's ideas about sacrifice, noting that \"I like the idea of sacrifice to do things. If they are done that way they are more lasting. If they cost more, then you will value them more.\"\nApart from Catholic social teaching, the movement of Chavez was also based on liberation theology, emphasizing liberation of the poor and self-sacrifice in the pursuit of justice. Liberation theology sought to centralize Catholic faith on the perspective and plight of the excluded, marginalized, poor and oppressed; basic points of liberation theology was the belief that God speaks directly for and to the poor, and that socioeconomic systems that oppress the poor are morally unacceptable. Gustavo Gutierrez, who provided much of the theoretical basis for liberation theology, stated that the \"theology of liberation represents the right of the poor to think\". Frederick John Dalton argues that Chavez was the reflection of liberation theology, writing: \"The moral vision of Cesar Chavez is the moral vision of a Mexican-American migrant farm worker and labor organizer with no formal education beyond the eighth grade. It is the moral vision of a man who knew the indignities of being impoverished and excluded. A field laborer of Mexican descent, he experienced life as a nonperson, as little more than an agricultural implement, a cost to be minimized.\" Similarly, Mark R. Day, a member of UFW, remarked that \u201cin many ways we were practicing liberation theology in Delano in the late 1960s.\u201d\nMany of the UFW's protests have been interpreted as representing not only farmworkers but the Mexican-American community more broadly, making a statement that Anglo-Americans must recognize Mexican-Americans as \"legitimate players in American life\". Chavez saw parallels in the way that African Americans were treated in the United States to the way that he and his fellow Mexican Americans were treated. He absorbed many of the tactics that African American civil rights activists had employed throughout the 1960s, applying them to his own movement. He was willing to take risks. Chavez recognized the impact that his farm-worker campaigns had had on the Chicano Movement during the early 1970s, although he kept his distance from the latter movement and many of its leaders. He condemned the violence that some figures in the Chicano Movement espoused.\n\nOn organization and leadership\nChavez placed the success of the movement above all else; Pawel described him as \"the ultimate pragmatist\". He felt that he had to be both the leader and the organizer-in-chief of his movement because only he had the necessary commitment to the cause. He was interested in power and how to use it; although his role model in this was Gandhi, he also studied the ideas about power by Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, Adolf Hitler, and Mao Zedong, drawing ideas from each. His use of purges to expel people from his movement was influenced by Mao's Cultural Revolution, and he opened a June 1978 board meeting by reciting a poem by Mao. Chavez repeatedly referred to himself as a community organizer rather than as a labor leader and underscored that distinction. He wanted his organization to represent not just a union but a larger social movement. He was ambivalent about the national labor movement. He personally disliked many of the prominent figures within the American labor movement but, as a pragmatist, recognized the value of working with organized labor groups. He opposed the idea of paying wages to those who worked for the union, believing that it would destroy the spirit of the movement. He rarely fired people from their positions, but instead made their working situation uncomfortable so that they would resign.\nChavez's leadership style was authoritarian; he stated that when he launched his movement, he initially had \"total, absolute power\" over it. Bruns characterized the UFW under Chavez as an \"autocratic regime\". Ex-members of the group, such as Bustamante and Padilla described Chavez as a dictator within the union. Chavez felt unable to share the responsibilities of running his movement with others. In 1968, Fred Hirsch noted that \"one thing which characterizes Cesar's leadership is that he takes full responsibility for as much of the operation as he is physically capable of. All decisions are made by him.\" Itliong noted that \"Cesar is afraid that if he shares the authority with the people[...] they might run away from him.\" Pawel noted that Chavez wanted \"yes-men\" around him.\nHe divided members of movements such as his into three groups: those that achieved what they set out to do, those that worked hard but failed what they set out to do, and those that were lazy. He thought that the latter needed to be expelled from the movement. He highly valued individuals who were loyal, efficient, and took the initiative. Explaining his attitudes toward activism, he told his volunteers that \"nice guys throughout the ages have done very little for humanity. It isn't the nice guy who gets things done. It's the hardheaded guy.\" He admitted that he could be \"a real bastard\" when dealing with movement members; Chavez told UFW volunteers that \"I'm a son of a bitch to work with\". He would play different people against each other to get what he wanted, particularly to break apart allies who might form an independent power bloc that would threaten his domination of the movement.\n\nReception and legacy\nIn the popular imagination, Chavez and the movement he led became largely synonymous, although throughout his career, Chavez prompted strong reactions from others. Since his death, there has been a struggle to define his legacy.\nDuring his lifetime, many of Chavez's supporters idolized him, engaging in a form of hero worship.  Bruns noted that many of his supporters \"nearly worshipped him as a folk hero\". In 1982, the American country music singer Kris Kristofferson called Chavez \"the only true hero we have walking on this Earth today\".\nThese supporters were known as \"Chavistas\"; many of them, especially those living at the La Paz commune, emulated his vegetarian diet. By the 1970s, he was increasingly referred to as a \"saint\" among those who supported him. In response to these claims, Chavez insisted that \"There is a big difference between being a saint and being an angel[...] Saints are known for being tough and stubborn.\" In 1972, John Zerzan described Chavez as presenting himself as \"a Christ-figure sacrificing all for his flock\" through his fasts, adding that Chavez took the form of a \"messianic leader\". The scholar of Latino studies Lilia Soto called him and Huerta \"freedom fighters\". He received a range of awards and accolades, which he claimed to hate. For these supporters, his visions for the future were regarded as inspirational. Bruns noted that he had \"a mesmerizing effect on the lives of thousands. They saw in him nobility, sacrifice, and the grit of the underdog who refuses to give up.\" Throughout his career as an activist, he received strong ecumenical support. The UFW gained the support of mainline Protestant groups in a way that previous farmworker movements never had.\nChavez was despised by many growers. John Giumarra Jr, of the Giumarra company, called Chavez a \"New Left guerrilla\", someone who wanted to topple \"the established structure of American democracy\". The FBI monitored him and many other senior figures in his movement, concerned that they were subversive. Having monitored him for over a decade, the FBI's dossier on Chavez grew to over 1,500 pages in length. They ultimately found no evidence suggesting he had communist leanings. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, he received a series of death threats, and\u2014according to Bruns\u2014he often faced \"spiteful mobs and scurrilous race-baiting\".\nWithin Chavez's movement itself, there was concern and criticism of his methods. It the early 1970s, for instance, Chavez-supporter George Higgins wrote a private memo arguing that Chavez \"appealed very crassly\" to feelings of guilt among many \"Protestant social actionists\" and threatened them \"with the enmity of the poor\" if they failed to meet with Chavez's demands. Many ex-members of the UFW took the view that Chavez had been a poor administrator. Other labor unions had long been wary of Chavez's movement, with the UFW gaining a reputation for always wanting money but doing little to assist others. In the U.S. union movement, many skeptics believed that Chavez's idealism detracted from his effectiveness as a union leader. Paul Hall of the Seafarers International Union of North America met him in Washington, D.C., during the 1970s, at which he criticized Chavez for acting like a saint rather than a union leader, stating that he had become \"a fad \u2013 the poor man others can support to expiate their sins\". Some Mexican-Americans were critical of Chavez, believing him an agitator and trouble-maker who was insufficiently patriotic in his views of the United States. Some critics believed that Chavez's activism was mobilized largely by the desire for personal gain and ambition.\n\nBruns noted that Chavez's movement was \"part of the fervor of change [in the United States] of the late 1960s\", alongside the civil rights movement and the campaign against the Vietnam War. The historian Ronald A. Wells described Chavez as \"one of the most important Christian activists in our time,\" while the theologian Hosffman Ospino called him \"one of the most influential social leaders in the history of the United States\". Pawel referred to Chavez as \"an improbable idol in an era of telegenic leaders and charismatic speakers\". The historian Nelson Lichtenstein commented that Chavez's UFW oversaw \"the largest and most effective boycott [in the United States] since the colonists threw tea into Boston Harbor\".\nLichtenstein also stated that Chavez had become \"an iconic, foundational figure in the political, cultural, and moral history\" of the Latino American community. Many Latinos drew inspiration from his movement, including student activists \u2013 for instance, UCSC's Cesar Chavez Convocation. He has been described as a \"folk saint\" of the Mexican-American community. A poll conducted by the Los Angeles Times in 1983 found that Chavez was the Latino whom the Latinos of California most admired.\nThe scholar Steven Lloyd-Moffett argued that after Chavez's death, the \"liberal intelligentsia and Chicano activists\" came to dominate attempts to define his legacy and that they downplayed his firm commitment to Christianity so as to portray him as being motivated by \"a secular ideology of justice and non-violence\".\nWhen the Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama was campaigning for the presidency in 2008, he used S\u00ed se puede\u2014translated into English as \"Yes we can\"\u2014as one of his main campaign slogans. When Obama was seeking re-election in 2012, he visited Chavez's grave and placed a rose upon it, also declaring his Union Headquarters to be a national monument.\nChavez's work has continued to exert influence on later activists. For instance, in his 2012 article in the Journal of the Society of Christian Ethics, Kevin J. O'Brien argued that Chavez could be \"a vital resource for contemporary Christian ecological ethics\". O'Brien argued that it was both Chavez's focus on \"the moral centrality of human dignity\" as well as his emphasis on sacrifice that could be of use by Christians wanting to engage in environmentalist activism. The theologian Carlos R. Piar similarly stated that Hispanic people should look to Chavez as an exemplar for \"a way of being Christian in the United States\".\n\nOrders, decorations, monuments, and honors\nChavez received a range of awards, both during his lifetime and posthumously. In 1973, he received the Jefferson Award for Greatest Public Service Benefiting the Disadvantaged, and in 1992 the Pacem in Terris Award, a Catholic award meant to honor \"achievements in peace and justice\". In August 1994, Chavez was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the country's highest honor for non-military personnel, by Democratic President Bill Clinton. Chavez's widow collected it from the White House. Clinton stated that Chavez had been a \"remarkable man\" and that \"he was for his own people a Moses figure\". In 2006, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger inducted Chavez into the California Hall of Fame. Asteroid 6982 Cesarchavez, discovered by Eleanor Helin at Palomar Observatory in 1993, was named in his memory; the official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on August 27, 2019 (M.P.C. 115893). In March 2013, Google celebrated his 86th birthday with a Google Doodle.\nThe Reuther-Chavez Award was created in 2002 by Americans for Democratic Action \"to recognize important activist, scholarly and journalistic contributions on behalf of workers' rights, especially the right to unionize and bargain collectively\". Colegio Cesar Chavez, named after Chavez while he was still alive, was a four-year \"college without walls\" in Mount Angel, Oregon, intended for the education of Mexican-Americans, that ran from 1973 to 1983. On May 18, 2011, Navy Secretary Ray Mabus announced that the Navy would be naming the last of 14 Lewis and Clark-class cargo ships after Cesar Chavez. The USNS Cesar Chavez was launched on May 5, 2012.\n\nIn 2004, the National Chavez Center was opened on the UFW national headquarters campus in Keene by the C\u00e9sar E. Ch\u00e1vez Foundation. It currently consists of a visitor center, memorial garden and his grave site. When it is fully completed, the 187-acre (0.76 km2) site will include a museum and conference center to explore and share Chavez's work. On September 14, 2011, the U.S. Department of the Interior added the 187 acres (76 ha) Nuestra Senora Reina de La Paz ranch to the National Register of Historic Places. On October 8, 2012, President Barack Obama designated the Cesar E. Chavez National Monument within the National Park system. California State University San Marcos' Chavez Plaza includes a statue to Chavez. In 2007, The University of Texas at Austin unveiled its own Cesar Chavez statue on campus. The Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 authorized the National Park Service to conduct a special resource study of sites that are significant to the life of Cesar Chavez and the farm labor movement in the western United States. The study evaluated the significance and suitability of sites significant to Cesar Chavez and the farm labor movement, and the feasibility and appropriateness of a National Park Service role in the management of any of these sites.\nCesar Chavez's birthday, March 31, is a holiday in California, Denver (Colorado), and Texas. It is intended to promote community service in honor of Chavez's life and work. Many, but not all, state government offices, community colleges, and libraries are closed. Many public schools in the three states are also closed. Chavez Day is an optional holiday in Arizona. Although it is not a federal holiday, President Barack Obama proclaimed March 31 \"Cesar Chavez Day\" in the United States, with Americans being urged to \"observe this day with appropriate service, community, and educational programs to honor C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez's enduring legacy\". The heavily Hispanic city of Laredo, Texas, observes \"Cesar Chavez Month\" during March. Organized by the local League of United Latin American Citizens, a citizens' march is held in downtown Laredo on the last Saturday morning of March to commemorate Chavez. In the Mission District, San Francisco a \"Cesar Chavez Holiday Parade\" is held on the second weekend of April, in honor of Cesar Chavez.\nChavez was referenced by Stevie Wonder in the song \"Black Man\" from the 1976 album Songs in the Key of Life. The 2014 American film C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez, starring Michael Pe\u00f1a as Chavez, covered Chavez's life in the 1960s and early 1970s. That same year, a documentary film, titled Cesar's Last Fast, was released. He received belated full military honors from the U.S. Navy at his graveside on April 23, 2015, the 22nd anniversary of his death. In 2015, statues of Chavez and Huerta were erected above a pizzeria in Downtown Napa, financed by a wealthy private citizen, Michael Holcomb, rather than city authorities.\nThere is a portrait of Chavez in the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. In 2003, the United States Postal Service honored Chavez with a postage stamp. A three-dimensional mural by artist Johanna Poethig, Tiene la lumbre por dentro (He Has the Fire Within Him) (2000) at Sonoma State University, honors Chavez and the Farm Workers Movement. The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) nominated him three times for the Nobel Peace Prize.\nAt the start of the presidency of Joe Biden, a bust of Chavez was placed on a table directly behind the Resolute desk in the Oval Office.\n\nSee also\nList of civil rights leaders\nList of peace activists\nList of vegans\nS\u00ed se puede\nUnion organizer\n\nReferences\nFootnotes\nBibliography\nFurther reading\nBardacke, Frank.

The stadium, built in 1969, is named for UCLA track legend Elvin C. \"Ducky\" Drake, who was a student-athlete, track coach and athletic trainer for over 60 years. It was the home of the UCLA Bruins men's and women's soccer teams until 2017. They are now playing at the soccer-specific Wallis Annenberg Stadium also located on the campus of University of California, Los Angeles.\nThere was a proposal in 1965 to build a 44,000 seat \"Multi-Purpose Stadium\" on campus, for UCLA Bruins track meets and varsity football games, rather than the Bruins using the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for home field.  In both spring and fall 1965, UCLA students \"voted by a two-to-one majority against the proposal to use fee funds to build a football stadium.\"  Additionally, the proposal was opposed by influential area residents and politicians.  By February 1966 UCLA had scaled back the project to the Drake Stadium configuration.  Although the football stadium never became a reality, there have been UCLA Bruins football scrimmage games played in the stadium.\nDrake Stadium has hosted the Pacific-10 (now Pac-12) Track and Field Championships, the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships in 1976-77-78, the Pacific-8 Championships in 1970 and 1977 and the CIF California State Meet for high schools in 1969-71-77. The facility hosted the first-ever California-Nevada Championships on April 30-May 1, 1994. It also has hosted other student events such as concerts and graduation ceremonies.\nThe track at Drake Stadium is named for gold medalist Rafer Johnson and his wife Betty. The field is named for UCLA alumnus Frank Marshall, a film producer.\nOn May 20, 1990, Randy Barnes set the world record of 23.12 m (75 ft 10 in) in the Shot Put in Drake Stadium.  The record lasted over 31 years until it was beaten by Ryan Crouser in Eugene, Oregon.  On May 27, 2023, Crouser improved upon his world record with a 23.56 m (77 ft 3+1\u20442 in) at the Los Angeles Grand Prix, returning the record to Drake Stadium.\n\nNotable athletes\nCarlos Bocanegra\nAto Boldon\nJonathan Bornstein\nTom Bradley\nLauren Cheney\nDanny Everett\nBenny Feilhaber\nDawn Harper\nJoanna Hayes\nMonique Henderson\nFlorence Griffith-Joyner\nJackie Joyner-Kersee\nMeb Keflezighi\nRafer Johnson\nCobi Jones\nSteve Lewis\nMike Powell\nJackie Robinson\nMike Tully\nC.K.

It is part of the Central Los Angeles region and covers a 5.84 sq mi (15.1 km2) area. As of 2020, it contains over 500,000 jobs and has a population of roughly 85,000 residents, with an estimated daytime population of over 200,000 people prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDowntown Los Angeles is divided into neighborhoods and districts, some overlapping. Most districts are named for the activities concentrated there now or historically, such as the Arts, Fashion, Banking, Theater, Toy, and Jewelry Districts. It is the hub for the city's urban rail transit system, as well as the Pacific Surfliner and Metrolink commuter rail system covering greater Southern California. Also located in downtown is the Civic Center, the administrative core of the city government.\nHistorically, downtown held a dense concentration of banks, department stores, and movie palaces that drew residents and visitors of all socioeconomic classes, but after the 1950s the area began to experience an economic decline. Still, it remained an important center for various activities\u2014government business in the Civic Center, banking on Bunker Hill, and retail and entertainment, especially for Hispanic Angelenos and immigrants, on Broadway. Since the early 2000s, downtown has experienced a renaissance of economic revitalization, including the Crypto.com Arena in downtown's south end, and the restoration and repurposing of historic buildings in the area.\n\nHistory\nThe Tongva village of Yaanga was located in what is now downtown Los Angeles, possibly near or underneath where the Bella Union Hotel was located (now Fletcher Bowron Square).\n\nSpanish and Mexican era\nFather Juan Cresp\u00ed, a Spanish Franciscan missionary charged with exploring sites for Catholic missions in California, noted in 1769 that the region had \"all the requisites for a large settlement\".  On September 4, 1781, Los Angeles was founded by a group of settlers who trekked north from present-day Mexico. Like most urban centers in the Spanish Empire, the town grew in a grid-like street pattern around a central plaza which faced the first church. The area passed to American control in 1847, and the small town grew to 11,000 by 1880, The business district was centered along Main Street between the Plaza and First Street.\n\nVictorian-era Downtown\nLand speculation increased in the 1880s, which saw the population of the city explode from 11,000 in 1880 to nearly 100,000 by 1896. Infrastructure enhancements and the laying of a street grid eventually brought development south of the Plaza: Victorian Downtown Los Angeles in the 1800s and 1890s along Main, Spring and Broadway south to Third Street \u2013 all of which were razed to make way for today's Civic Center. After 1900, larger buildings were constructed along Broadway and Spring from Third to Ninth streets in what is now called the Historic Core.\n\nDowntown's golden age\nBy 1920, the city's private and municipal rail lines were the most far-flung and most comprehensive in the world in mileage, even besting that of New York City. By this time, a steady influx of residents and aggressive land developers had transformed the city into a large metropolitan area, with DTLA at its center. Rail lines connected four counties with over 1,100 miles (1,800 km) of track.\nDuring the early part of the 20th century, banking institutions clustered around South Spring Street, forming the Spring Street Financial District. Sometimes referred to as the \"Wall Street of the West,\" the district held corporate headquarters for financial institutions including Bank of America, Farmers and Merchants Bank, the Crocker National Bank, California Bank & Trust, and International Savings & Exchange Bank. The Los Angeles Stock Exchange was also located on the corridor from 1929 until 1986 before moving into a new building across the Harbor (110) Freeway.\nCommercial growth brought with it hotel construction\u2014during this time period several grand hotels, the Alexandria (1906), the Rosslyn (1911), and the Biltmore (1923), were erected\u2014and also the need for venues to entertain the growing population of Los Angeles. Broadway became the nightlife, shopping and entertainment district of the city, with over a dozen theater and movie palaces built before 1932.\nDepartment stores, most that had grown from local dry goods businesses, moved from Spring and Main streets around Temple and 1st, to much larger stores along Broadway, including The Broadway, Hamburger's, which became May Co., Robinson's, Bullock's, Coulter's, Desmond's, Silverwoods, Harris & Frank, and the Fifth Street Store\/Walker's, serving a variety of socioeconomic groups from across the city and suburbs. All but Coulter's would, in the 1920s\u20131950s, launch branches dotting shopping centers across a growing Southern California. Numerous specialty stores also flourished including those in the jewelry business which gave rise to the Downtown Jewelry District. Among these early jewelers included the Laykin Diamond Company (later becoming Laykin et Cie) and Harry Winston & Co., both of which found their beginnings in the Hotel Alexandria at Fifth and Spring streets.\n\nDecline and redevelopment\nFollowing World War II, suburbanization, the development of the Los Angeles freeway network, and increased automobile ownership led to decreased investment downtown. Many corporate headquarters slowly dispersed to new suburbs or fell to mergers and acquisitions. As early as the 1920s once-stately Victorian mansions on Bunker Hill were dilapidated, serving as rooming houses for 20,000 working-class Angelenos.\nThe Broadway theaters saw much use as Spanish-language movie houses during this time, beginning with the conversion of the Million Dollar Theater in the 1950s to a Spanish-language theater.\n\nRecent years\nIn the early 2000s, the neighborhood became popular with Artists and Creatives due to low rent, open loft space, and many vacancies. In mid-2013, downtown was noted as \"a neighborhood with an increasingly hip and well-heeled residential population\".\nBecause of the downtown area's office market's migration west to Bunker Hill and the Financial District, many historic office buildings have been left intact, which is simply used for storage or remaining empty during recent decades. In 1999, the Los Angeles City Council passed an adaptive reuse ordinance, making it easier for developers to convert outmoded, vacant office and commercial buildings into renovated lofts and luxury apartment and condo complexes.\nAs of early 2009, 14,561 residential units have been created under the adaptive reuse ordinance, leading to an increase in the residential population.  With 28,878 residents in 2006, 39,537 in 2008, and over 60,000 in 2017, Downtown Los Angeles is seeing new life and investment.\n\nCrypto.com Arena, which opened in 1999, has contributed immensely to the revitalization plans, adding 250 events and nearly 4 million visitors per year to the neighborhood. Since the opening of the Staples Center, the adjacent L.A. Live complex was completed, which includes the Microsoft Theatre and the Grammy Museum.\nLos Angeles Metro Rail, a rail transit network centered on the downtown area, facilitates access to the city center, especially from the congested West Side.\nReal estate developers and investors planned a $1.8 billion revitalization project along Grand Avenue, which included the development of Grand Park, a large city park, and the construction of major city landmarks, including the Frank Gehry-designed Walt Disney Concert Hall and contemporary art museum The Broad, which opened in 2015.\nOn August 7, 2007, the Los Angeles City Council approved sweeping changes in zoning and development rules for the downtown area. Strongly advocated by Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, the changes allow larger and denser developments downtown; developers who reserve 15% of their units for low-income residents are now exempt from some open-space requirements and can make their buildings 35% larger than current zoning codes allow.\nIn 2009 Bottega Louie opened on the first floor of the historic Brockman Building on Grand Avenue and Seventh Street. It contributed to the revitalization of DTLA by creating Restaurant Row, which has since brought numerous new restaurants and retail shops to the area. In 2012, the upper 11 floors of the Brockman Building were bought with the intention of being sold as luxury lofts.\nSeveral labels of Warner Music Group moved into the Los Angeles Arts District in 2019 where the company had purchased a former Ford Motor Company assembly plant.\nBroadway retail is transitioning from a broad mix of stores catering mostly to Hispanic immigrants and a burgeoning sneaker and streetwear retail cluster has emerged from 4th to 9th streets: Sneaker Row.\nOceanwide Plaza has planned to open in 2020, but was later changed to unknown date due to financial problems and costs.\nMultiple Olympic and Paralympic events will be held in DTLA during the 2028 Summer Olympics and Paralympics.\nAfter six years of construction, the new Sixth Street Viaduct opened on July 9, 2022 at a cost of $588-million. This new bridge replaced a 1932 viaduct of the same name which was demolished in 2016 due to a fact that it would collapse if there were a major earthquake, and alkali-silica reaction \u2013 colloquially known as \u201cconcrete cancer.\u201d Pedestrian and bicycle access points link to other projects such as 12 acres of new park space below the viaduct.\n\nShopping malls\nShopping centers include FIGat7th, and The Bloc Los Angeles, an open-air shopping area. Others include Japanese Village Plaza in Little Tokyo, City National Plaza, the Homer Laughlin Building, and the Los Angeles Mall.\n\nGeography\nDowntown Los Angeles is flanked by Echo Park to the north and northwest, Chinatown to the northeast, Boyle Heights to the east, Vernon to the south, Historic South Central and University Park to the southwest, and Pico-Union and Westlake to the west.\nDowntown is bounded on the northeast by Cesar Chavez Avenue, on the east by the Los Angeles River, on the south by the Los Angeles city line with Vernon, on the southwest by East Washington Boulevard and on the west by the 110 Freeway or Beaudry Avenue, including the entire Four Level Interchange with the 101 Freeway.\n\nDistricts\nThe neighborhood includes these districts:\n\nClimate\nPopulation\nThe 2000 U.S. census found that just 27,849 residents lived in the 5.84 square miles of downtown\u2014or 4,770 people per square mile, among the lowest densities for the city of Los Angeles but about average for the county. The Southern California Association of Governments estimates that downtown's daytime population is 207,440. The population increased to 34,811 by 2008, according to city estimates. By the end of 2019, the population of the district had grown to 85,000 residents, and 7,956 residential units were under construction. The median age for residents was 39, considered old for the city and the county.\nDowntown Los Angeles is almost evenly balanced among the four major racial and ethnic groups\u2014Asian Americans (23%), African Americans (22%), Latinos (25%) and non-Hispanic whites (26%)\u2014according to an analysis of 2010 census data made by Loyola Marymount University researchers.\nA study of the 2000 census showed that downtown was the second\u2013most diverse neighborhood in Los Angeles, its diversity index being 0.743, outrated only by Mid-Wilshire. The ethnic breakdown in 2000 was Latinos, 36.7%; blacks, 22.3%; Asians, 21.3%; whites, 16.2%, and others, 3.5%. Mexico (44.7%) and Korea (17%) were the most common places of birth for the 41.9% of the residents who were born abroad, about the same ratio as in the city as a whole.\nThe median household income in 2008 dollars was $15,003, considered low for both the city and the county. The percentage of households earning $20,000 or less (57.4%) was the highest in Los Angeles County, followed by University Park (56.6%) and Chinatown (53.6%). The average household size of 1.6 people was relatively low. Renters occupied 93.4% of the housing units, and home or apartment owners the rest.\nIn 2000, there were 2,400 military veterans living downtown, or 9.7% of the population, considered a high rate for the city but average for the county overall.\nIn 2010, census data concluded that 40,227 people lived in Downtown Los Angeles.\nIn 2013, a study by Downtown Center Business Improvement District showed that of the 52,400 people resided in Downtown Los Angeles, the demographic breakdown was 52.7% Caucasian, 20.1% Asian, 17.0% Latino, and 6.2% African-American; 52.9% female, 47.1% male; and 74.8% of residents were between the ages of 23\u201344. The median age for residents was 34. The median household income was $98,700. The median household size was 1.8. In terms of educational attainment, 80.1% of residents had completed at least 4 years of college. The study was a self-selecting sample of 8,841 respondents across the DTLA area. It was not a \"census\" but rather a comprehensive survey of Downtown LA consumers.\nAn additional study by the Downtown Center Business Improvement District showed that by 2017 the population reached 67,324. In early 2020 the population was estimated to have exceeded 80,000 at the end of 2019.\n\nPublic transportation\nLocal and regional service\nDowntown Los Angeles is the center of the region's growing rail transit system, with six commuter lines operated by Metrolink, as well as six urban rail transit lines and local and regional bus service operated by Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro).\nMajor Metro stations in the district include Union Station, Civic Center\/Grand Park station, Pershing Square station, 7th Street\/Metro Center station, Pico station, Little Tokyo\/Arts District station, Historic Broadway station, and Grand Avenue Arts\/Bunker Hill station.\n\nThe Los Angeles Metro Rail system has four rail lines that serve Downtown Los Angeles: the A Line, B Line, D Line, and E Line.\nIn late 2009, the Metro J Line bus rapid transit project opened, replacing two unconnected bus rapid transit lines with through service at street level through the downtown area.\nIn 2006, a portion of the Metro Red Line (now the B Line) was rebranded by Metro as the Metro Purple Line (now the D Line), a heavy-rail subway line which runs from Union Station to Wilshire\/Western station in Koreatown. A westward extension of the line to Westwood is currently under construction.\nMetro operates an extensive bus network, including Metro Local, Metro Express commuter lines, and Metro Rapid buses with signal priority and limited stops.\nLos Angeles Department of Transportation operates seven local DASH shuttle lines downtown on weekdays: Lines A, B, C, D, E and F.  Weekend service is operated on lines DD (Downtown Discovery), E and F.\nThe Regional Connector Transit Corridor connected the A, E, and L Lines between the Little Tokyo\/Arts District and 7th Street\/Metro Center stations which opened on June 16, 2023. This had the A and E Lines take over different parts of the L Line, which was promptly discontinued.\n\nAmtrak\nAmtrak operates intercity passenger train service on five routes through Los Angeles Union Station: the Coast Starlight, Pacific Surfliner, Southwest Chief, Sunset Limited, and Texas Eagle.\n\nGreyhound\nGreyhound Lines operates a major bus terminal in Downtown Los Angeles at the intersection of Seventh and Alameda streets.\n\nService to Los Angeles International Airport\nLos Angeles World Airports operates a direct shuttle, LAX FlyAway Bus, every 30\u201360 minutes between Union Station and Los Angeles International Airport.\n\nTransit expansion\nThe Metro E Line was built in two phases and completed in 2016. The first phase of the project connected 7th Street\/Metro Center Station downtown with Culver City via the former Pacific Electric Railway Santa Monica Air Line right-of-way. The second phase extended the line to Santa Monica.  The E Line shares tracks with the Metro A Line north of Washington Boulevard, and shares the Pico Station, 7th Street\/Metro Center Station, Grand Avenue Arts\/Bunker Hill station, Historic Broadway station, and Little Tokyo\/Arts District station with the A Line.\nUnion Station is set to be a major stop on the under-construction California High-Speed Rail system, though it will not be a part of the project's Initial Operating Segment. The project would connect Northern and Southern California via the San Joaquin Valley, with service averaging 220 miles per hour (350 km\/h).\nWork is planned to bring streetcar-style trolley service to Downtown Los Angeles via Broadway, connecting the L.A. Live development with the Grand Avenue cultural corridor and Bunker Hill.\n\nParks and open space\nDowntown Los Angeles is home to several public parks, plazas, gardens and other open space:\n\nLos Angeles Plaza\nOlvera Street\nEl Pueblo de Los \u00c1ngeles Historical Monument\nCathedral of Our Lady of the Angels meditation garden and olive garden (park)\nBiddy Mason Park\nGrand Park\nMaguire Gardens\nPershing Square\nLos Angeles City Hall South Lawn\nLos Angeles Police Department's Police Administration Building South Lawn\nLos Angeles State Historic Park\nUnion Station gardens\nWalt Disney Concert Hall Community Park\nThe Water Court at California Plaza, an outdoor performance and dining space with water features, fountains, shaded seating areas and an amphitheater.\nJapanese Garden and plaza at the Little Tokyo Cultural and Community Center Plaza\nJapanese Garden at the Kyoto Grand Hotel and Gardens\nGarden at Bank of America Plaza\nSeveral future park proposals for the district make use of public-private partnerships between developers and the city of Los Angeles, including a public park at the proposed Nikkei Center development in Little Tokyo; a 1-acre (4,000 m2) park at the Medallion development in the Historic Core; and a pocket park at the Wilshire Grand Hotel replacement project, currently under construction.\nAdditionally, the city recently completed a new park located on the 400 block of South Spring Street in the Historic Core neighborhood.\n\nSkyline\nDespite its relative decentralization and comparatively new high-rises (until 1958, the city did not permit any structures taller than the 27-story City Hall building), Los Angeles has one of the largest skylines in the United States, and its development has continued in recent years.\nThe skyline has seen rapid growth due to improvements in seismic design standards, which has made certain building types highly earthquake-resistant. Many of the new skyscrapers contain a housing or hotel component.\nSome current and upcoming examples of skyscraper construction include:\n\n705 Ninth Street, a 35-story residential tower, was completed in 2009.\n717 Olympic, a 26-story residential tower, was completed in mid-2008.\n888 Olive, a 32-story apartment tower by Vancouver-based Omni Group,  opened in 2015.\nConcerto, a 28-story residential tower, was completed in early 2009.  A second phase (Tower II) is currently under construction.\nThe Grand Avenue Project, designed by architect Frank Gehry, is a multi-phase project on four parcels. It includes a 39-story hotel tower at the corner of First Street and Grand Avenue and a civic park.\nL.A. Live, a multi-phased dining, entertainment and hotel development that includes a Ritz-Carlton and JW Marriott Hotel hybrid as well as Ritz-Carlton-branded condominiums, was completed in February 2010.\nMarriott International completed a 24-story Courtyard and Residence Inn tower near L.A. Live, which opened in July 2014, and plans to build a 20+ story Renaissance hotel to open in 2016.\nMetropolis, a mixed-use four-tower project (60, 50, 38, and 19 stories) at Francisco and Ninth streets, is currently under construction.\nSouth, a three-tower complex called Elleven, Luma, and Evo, spans the block from 11th Street and Grand Avenue to 12th Street and Grand Avenue, and was completed in phases ending in early 2009.\nThe Wilshire Grand Tower redevelopment, a 900-room hotel and office project built in 2017, is the tallest tower west of the Mississippi River, at 1,100 feet (340 m).\nFigueroa Centre, a 975-foot residential and hotel tower proposed across from The Original Pantry restaurant on the Figueroa Corridor. The tower proposed will become the third tallest building in Los Angeles when completed.\nAngels Landing, a proposed super tall tower at 1020 ft. Currently in the funding stage. Approved by the city council in 2017.\n\nBuilding height limits: 1904\u20131957\nThe first height limit ordinance in Los Angeles was enacted following the completion of the 13-story Continental Building, located at the southeast corner of Fourth and Spring streets. The purpose of the height limit was to limit the density of the city. There was great hostility to skyscrapers in many cities in these years, mainly due to the congestion they could bring to the streets, and height limit ordinances were a common way of dealing with the problem. In 1911, the city passed an updated height limit ordinance, establishing a specific limit of 150 feet (46 m). Exceptions were granted for decorative towers such as those later built on the Eastern Columbia Building and United Artists Theatre, as well as the now-demolished Richfield Tower.\n\nFlat Roof Ordinance\nThe pattern of buildings in Los Angeles to feature flat rooftops was the result of a 1974 fire ordinance which required all tall buildings in the city to include rooftop helipads in response to the devastating 1974 Joelma Fire in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in which helicopters were used to effect rescues from the flat rooftop of the building. The Wilshire Grand Center was the first building granted an exception by the Los Angeles City Fire Department in 2014. However, as the building was under construction, L.A. City Council removed the flat roof ordinance as of 2015.\n\nGovernment and infrastructure\nThe Los Angeles County Department of Health Services operates the Central Health Center in Downtown Los Angeles.\nThe Southern California Liaison of the California Department of Education has its office in the Ronald Reagan State Building in Downtown Los Angeles.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Los Angeles Branch is located in Downtown Los Angeles.\n\nEconomy\nDTLA is a node in the tech economy that extends beyond Silicon Beach. A venture capital firm counted 78 tech-oriented firms in DTLA in 2015. This included mobile apps, hardware, digital media and clean-tech companies plus co-working spaces, start-up incubators, and other related businesses.\nThe Arts District has become a popular spot for companies seeking out something different from typical modern offices. The central location is accessible from various parts of the Los Angeles Basin. The cultural life has also made the area attractive to young tech employees. Two Bit Circus is the only amusement park located in the area.\nAnschutz Entertainment Group has its corporate headquarters in Downtown Los Angeles. BYD Company, a Chinese technology firm, has its North American headquarters in Downtown Los Angeles.\nThe Last Bookstore is an independent bookstore founded in 2005 by Josh Spencer, that was called California\u2019s largest new and used bookstore by Conde Nast Traveler in 2019. Cathay Bank has its headquarters in the Los Angeles Chinatown.\n\nEducation\nDowntown residents aged 25 and older holding a four-year degree amounted to 17.9% of the population in 2000, about average in the city and the county, but there was a high percentage of residents with less than a high school diploma.\nThese are the elementary or secondary schools within the neighborhood's boundaries:\n\nRamon C.

The gift shop was located at 8200 Sunset Boulevard, a few yards from the former Jay Ward Productions (8218 Sunset Blvd.), the tiny studio building where the cartoons were produced, and across the street from the Chateau Marmont. The Dudley Do-Right Emporium opened in 1971 and closed its doors in April 2005.\nThe shop was filled with toys, stuffed animals, trinkets, hats, t-shirts, wristwatches, original animation cels, cartoon scripts, recordings of TV themes, and assorted souvenirs, all bearing the likenesses of Dudley Do-Right, Rocky & Bullwinkle, Peabody and Sherman, Hoppity Hooper, George of the Jungle, Tom Slick, Super Chicken, Boris & Natasha, Snidely Whiplash and the other famous, wacky creations of Jay Ward Studios.\nIn front of Jay Ward Productions was a 15-foot (4.6 m) statue of Bullwinkle J. Moose holding Rocky the Flying Squirrel. The statue was unveiled to the public at a kick-off party to commemorate \"The Bullwinkle Show\" joining NBC on September 20, 1961. Following Jay Ward's departure, the statue gradually fell into a state of disrepair and, in July 2013, was taken to DreamWorks Animation to be restored. When the restoration was completed, it was briefly displayed at the Paley Center in Beverly Hills. In January 2015, it was put on display at the West Hollywood City Hall. In August 2019 the West Hollywood city council decided to permanently place the statue on a traffic island at Sunset and Holloway.\nThe rotating statue of Bullwinkle holding Rocky was made to mimic the rotating statue of a Las Vegas showgirl on top of a giant billboard for the Sahara Hotel across Sunset Boulevard at the eastern end of the Sunset Strip.  A picture of this showgirl statue can also be found as the cover of Gore Vidal's Myra Breckinridge.\n\n\n== References ==","70":"The Earl Carroll Theatre was a historic stage facility located at 6230 Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, California. It was built by showman Earl Carroll and designed in the Streamline Moderne style by architect Gordon Kaufmann in 1938. The theatre has been known by a number of names since, including Moulin Rouge from 1953 to 1964 and the  Aquarius Theater in the 1960s and 1970s. From 1997 to 2017, it was officially known as Nickelodeon on Sunset (or Nick on Sunset), housing the West Coast production of live-action original series produced for the Nickelodeon cable channel.\nThe theater closed in 2017. In 2019, the building was leased for 10 years by a pair of theater operators who said they would restore and reopen the theater as part of a new entertainment complex.\n\nHistory\nEarly years\nThe Earl Carroll Theatre opened on December 26, 1938, with a lavish revue, \"Broadway to Hollywood,\" which featured sixty showgirls ascending 100 treads of stairs to a height of 135 feet. Many Hollywood celebrities were in attendance including Marlene Dietrich, Dolores del R\u00edo, the J. L. Warners, Richard Barthelmess, Sally Eilers, Edgar Bergen, Claudette Colbert, Constance Bennett, Errol Flynn, Lili Damita, William Gargan, Jackie Coogan, Betty Grable, Mary Livingstone, Phil Harris, Conrad Nagel, Mary Brian, Darryl Zanuck, David O. Selznick, and Norman Krasna. The $1,000 membership fee guaranteed a lifetime cover charge and a reserved seat.:\u200a40\u200a\nThe building was designed in the Moderne style by architect Gordon Kaufmann. The interior design is attributed to both Count Alexis de Sakhnoffsky and Frank Don Riha (1899\u20131957).:\u200a37\u200a As he had done at his New York theater, Carroll emblazoned over the entrance the words \"Through these portals pass the most beautiful girls in the world\". The theater-restaurant accommodated 1,200 diners :\u200a39\u200a and offered shows on a massive stage with a 60-foot (18 m) wide double revolving turntable and staircase and swings that could be lowered from the ceiling. The building's fa\u00e7ade was adorned by what at the time was one of Hollywood's most famous landmarks: a 20-foot-high (6.1 m) neon head portrait of entertainer Beryl Wallace, one of Earl Carroll's \"most beautiful girls in the world\", who became his devoted companion. The sign survived several changes of ownership and venue name but was completely removed during major decorative overhauling in 1968. A re-creation made from photos is today on display at Universal CityWalk, at Universal City, as part of the collection of historic neon signs from the Museum of Neon Art. Another prominent exterior feature was the \"Wall of Fame\", on which were mounted more than a hundred individual concrete blocks autographed by Hollywood celebrities, including some of the biggest stars of the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nThe Moderne-style interior was lavishly decorated with zeon (a variation of neon) tube lighting and artwork, some of which remains extant. In 1939, Life magazine described the new building: \"exhibits an ultramodern, super-streamlined interior with a patent-leather ceiling, 10,000 colored zeon lights, a 15-ft. statue, an acre of burgundy carpet.\" The centerpiece of the foyer was the Goddess of Light, a 15-foot-tall aluminum-covered plaster statue (extant) designed by Martin Deutsch. With hands lifted to the ceiling, the statue held a fifty-foot zeon tube that wound its way to the ceiling. The columns in the lobby bar (extant) were filled with zeon lamps and zeon stalactites hung from the ceiling in the cabaret. A large painting of Carroll painted by the artist Strandanees hung near the main entrance.:\u200a39\u200a\nLater achieving various degrees of fame in films and on television, Jean Spangler, Mara Corday, Yvonne De Carlo, Phyllis Coates, Maila Nurmi, Gloria Pall, Tyra Vaughn, and Mamie Van Doren were some of the showgirls who performed there. The facility was a popular night spot for many of Hollywood's most glamorous stars and powerful film industry moguls such as Darryl Zanuck and Walter Wanger, who sat on the Earl Carroll Theatre's board of governors.\nThe theater was sold following the 1948 deaths of Earl Carroll and Beryl Wallace in the crash of United Airlines Flight 624. It continued to operate but by the early 1950s, it was falling on hard times.\nIn 1953, Las Vegas showman Frank Sennes reopened the theater as a nightclub under the name Moulin Rouge. The popular TV contest show Queen for a Day was broadcast from the Moulin Rouge during part of the show's 1956\u20131964 run. The venue was also used for the 1965 concert film The Big TNT Show. In late 1965 it became the Hullabaloo, a rock and roll club for teenager to capitalize on the popularity of the musical variety show Hullabaloo. For several months in 1968 it was the Kaleidoscope and featured many top West Coast rock acts, with an emphasis on local bands such as The Doors.\nLater in 1968, the venue was renamed the Aquarius Theater and rededicated as the home of a long-running Los Angeles production of the Broadway musical Hair. It was accordingly redecorated in the psychedelic art style by the London-based Dutch design collective The Fool, which also created iconic late-1960s graphics for the Beatles, Cream with Eric Clapton, Procol Harum and other patrons. \nOn Mondays, when the Hair company had its day off, the theater was still sometimes used for rock concerts and the Aquarius consequently became famous for performances there by The Doors on July 21 & 22, 1969, the live recordings of which were later issued commercially.\nIn 1977, it was briefly known as the Longhorn Theatre and has also been called the Sunset Boulevard Theatre.\nIn 1983, the Pick-Vanoff Company purchased the property and converted it into a state-of-the-art television theater that for nine years was the taping site of Star Search. The Pick-Vanoff Company also owned Sunset-Gower Studios, formerly the home of Columbia Pictures. For many years, it was used for the annual Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon. In the fall of 1993, the theater was the venue for Fox Network's The Chevy Chase Show under the name The Chevy Chase Theater. The talk show was cancelled after five weeks; the theater reverted to its previous name soon after.\n\nNickelodeon on Sunset\nIn the mid-1990s, Nickelodeon decided to move production of some live-action series to the West Coast from Nickelodeon Studios in Orlando, Florida at Universal Studios. After scouting soundstages for a year, the network's headlining mover All That spent a year at Paramount Pictures before Nickelodeon obtained a lease for the 6238 Sunset Blvd facility, acquiring the soundstage and rebranding it Nickelodeon on Sunset by 1997. Due to limited studio space and the need to control plot spoilage for several programs, only a few series were taped at Nickelodeon on Sunset at a time.

In September 2016, the City Council also approved Palo Alto-based developer Essex Portfolio's proposal to construct a new mixed-use building on the western portion of the site of the theater building. The project will retain the historic building and incorporate new construction on the adjacent surface parking lot. The new development will be seven stories in height and linked to the theater building via a pedestrian paseo. The project calls for 4,700 square feet (440 m2) of ground floor commercial space, as well as 200 residential units. Ground was broken on October 17, 2017.\nOn September 25, 2019, Thaddeus Hunter Smith, a former owner of the nearby Fonda Theatre, and his business partner Brian Levian announced that they had signed a ten-year lease \"with the intention of not only restoring the building\u2019s original facilities, but also transforming the site into an entertainment complex, with spaces for concerts, stage shows, movie premieres, and other specialized events,\" The Architect's Newspaper reported.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nPhotographs: O'Connor, Pauline (October 23, 2017). \"Take a peek inside Hollywood's Earl Carroll Theatre\".

Located to the northwest of Downtown, it is bordered by Silver Lake to the west and Chinatown to the east. The culturally diverse neighborhood has become known for its trendy local businesses, as well as its popularity with artists, musicians and creatives. The neighborhood is centered on the eponymous Echo Park Lake.\n\nHistory\nEdendale\nEstablished in 1892, and long before Hollywood became synonymous with the commercial film industry of the United States, the area of Echo Park known as Edendale was the center of filmmaking on the West Coast.\nBy the 1910s, several film studios were operating on Allesandro Avenue (now Glendale Boulevard) along the Echo Park-Silverlake border, including the Selig Polyscope Company, Mack Sennett's Keystone Studios, the Pathe West Coast Film Studio, and others.\nSilent film stars who worked in the Edendale studios included \nFatty Arbuckle, Harold Lloyd,\nMabel Normand and Gloria Swanson. Charlie Chaplin's first film was made at Keystone Studios, as well as the very first feature-length comedy, which starred Chaplin and Normand.\nThe first pie-in-the-face scene was filmed at what later became the Mack Sennett Studios on Glendale Boulevard near Effie Street. The complex, which is now part of a storage facility, dates from 1909 and includes one of the area's first permanent sound stages, the factories where movies are made. The former studio, 1712 Glendale Boulevard, is City of Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument No. 256.\n\nEcho Park Lake\nEcho Park Lake was established in 1868, as a drinking water reservoir, filled with water from a ditch that connects to the Los Angeles River in Los Feliz to the reservoir. In 1891, the four owners of the surrounding area gave up 33 acres (13 ha) of land around the reservoir to the city so that it could be used as a park. The city began work landscaping the park in October 1892. City parks superintendent Joseph Henry Tomlinson chose the name because of echoes he heard during the construction of Echo Park Lake in 1892. By 1895, the park and accompanying boathouse were completed. By the late 1910s, motion picture companies on Allesandro Street, now Glendale Boulevard, had been using the park as a filming location.\nEcho Park Lake was identified as an impaired body of water in 2006, and the city allocated $64.7 million to fund its cleanup and revitalization. In the summer of 2011, the lake was closed off and drained when the rehabilitation project began. The lake reopened on June 5, 2013, after a $45 million renovation.\nStarting in November 2019, a growing population of homeless people began moving into the lake grounds. The encampment included nearly 200 homeless tents, and four homeless individuals died at the park in 2020. On March 25, 2021, the park was closed for renovations and cleared of the homeless encampments. While closure notices were posted throughout the park days before the sweep, over 200 protesters clashed with LAPD, who arrested 179 protesters. The encampment and ensuing incident became a major flashpoint in LA's homelessness crisis. \nOf the 183 homeless individuals living at Echo Park Lake, only 17 had successfully transitioned into permanent housing as of March 2022. In February 2023, councilmember Hugo Soto-Martinez announced plans to remove the fence that encircles the lake. The plans became divisive within the community, many of whom have advocated for the fence to remain, amid the ongoing homelessness crisis.\nThe fence surrounding the lake was removed May 30, 2023 by the city.\n\nTransportation\nGlendale Freeway termination\nThe Glendale Freeway (SR 2) was originally planned and constructed in 1959 to connect with the Hollywood Freeway (US-101) through the neighborhoods of Silver Lake and Echo Park, but terminates roughly 1.5 miles (2.4 km) northeast of its intended terminus at the Hollywood Freeway due to opposition from residents living and developers building on a hill that is now a private gated community called Hathaway Estates. \nIn 1962, as a result of this local community opposition, the full build-out plan was rescinded and construction was terminated at the present SR-2 terminus near Glendale Bl and Duane Street. Since then, commuter traffic exiting and entering on to SR-2 has passed through the community, primarily along Glendale Bl and Alvarado Street, which has contributed to congestion. Since that plan has been scrapped, the freeway is somewhat isolated from the remainder of the Los Angeles freeway system. There have been proposals to turn the freeway stub into a sort of public park.\n\nPacific Electric Railway\nThe Pacific Electric Railway, better known as the Red Cars, used to run through Echo Park along the center of Glendale Boulevard. The citywide system of electric trolleys began with the dawn of the 20th century, ultimately spinning a web of rail that linked cities in Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties. It was the largest and most advanced public transit system in the world at the time.\nThe Red Car system was sold to Metropolitan Coach Lines, whose executive, Jesse Haugh, had connections to a public transportation company funded by General Motors and other auto-related industries. The Red Cars faded out of service not long afterwards, with the Los Angeles-Glendale-Burbank Line that traveled through Echo Park officially ending service on June 19, 1955.\n\nGangs\nEcho Park was once infamous as a hot spot for gang activity. This was true in the 1980s and 1990s, but in the early 2010s as the neighborhood began gentrifying, rents started to skyrocket, and a controversial gang injunction forced gang members to move outside their turf, instances of gang violence waned.\nIn 2013, a Los Angeles judge signed off on a permanent gang injunction aimed at six rival gangs in the Echo Park area, creating what authorities call a \"safety zone\" for the area. The injunction targets the members of six gangs, namely Echo Park Locos, the Crazys, the Big Top Locos, the Diamond Street Locos, Frogtown Rifa, and Head Hunters. The perimeter for the safety zone is roughly bound by the Los Angeles River to the north, the 110 Freeway to the east, Beverly Boulevard to south and Glendale Boulevard to the west. It includes Echo Park Lake and Dodger Stadium.\nThe injunction, a civil order, prohibits two or more listed gang members from associating in any way in public or in common areas like courtyards. It also allows for stricter penalties if any listed gang member is caught with drugs, alcohol, guns or vandalizing property.\n\nGeography\nEcho Park has many rolling hills and valleys with a few flat areas like Echo Park Lake. Its main commercial corridors are Sunset and Glendale boulevards.\n\nLocation\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times \"Mapping L.A.\" project, Echo Park is in Central Los Angeles, between Hollywood and Downtown Los Angeles. It is situated near the 101, the 2, and the 5 freeways. Echo Park is flanked by Elysian Valley to the north and northeast, Elysian Park to the east, Chinatown and Downtown to the southeast, Westlake to the southwest and west, and Silver Lake to the northwest.\nBoundaries are the Golden State Freeway\u2013Glendale Freeway interchange at the north apex, Riverside Drive on the northeast, Elysian Park neighborhood on the east, Stadium Way and Beaudry Avenue on the southeast, the south apex being Beaudry Avenue and West Second Street and the west limit being an irregular line consisting of Second Street and Beverly Boulevard, then moving upward north along Benton Way and the Glendale Freeway.\n\nClimate\nBeing in the central part of Los Angeles, Echo Park experiences a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Csa). Temperatures here are almost identical to that of Downtown Los Angeles.\n\nDistricts\nWithin Echo Park are the following:\n\nAngelino Heights\nAngelino Heights is most notable for its Victorian era residences, although these are few in number.

It was the largest and most advanced public transit system in the world at the time.\nThe Red Car system was sold to Metropolitan Coach Lines, whose executive, Jesse Haugh, had connections to a public transportation company funded by General Motors and other auto-related industries. The Red Cars faded out of service not long afterwards, with the Los Angeles-Glendale-Burbank Line that traveled through Echo Park officially ending service on June 19, 1955.\n\nGangs\nEcho Park was once infamous as a hot spot for gang activity. This was true in the 1980s and 1990s, but in the early 2010s as the neighborhood began gentrifying, rents started to skyrocket, and a controversial gang injunction forced gang members to move outside their turf, instances of gang violence waned.\nIn 2013, a Los Angeles judge signed off on a permanent gang injunction aimed at six rival gangs in the Echo Park area, creating what authorities call a \"safety zone\" for the area. The injunction targets the members of six gangs, namely Echo Park Locos, the Crazys, the Big Top Locos, the Diamond Street Locos, Frogtown Rifa, and Head Hunters. The perimeter for the safety zone is roughly bound by the Los Angeles River to the north, the 110 Freeway to the east, Beverly Boulevard to south and Glendale Boulevard to the west. It includes Echo Park Lake and Dodger Stadium.\nThe injunction, a civil order, prohibits two or more listed gang members from associating in any way in public or in common areas like courtyards. It also allows for stricter penalties if any listed gang member is caught with drugs, alcohol, guns or vandalizing property.\n\nGeography\nEcho Park has many rolling hills and valleys with a few flat areas like Echo Park Lake. Its main commercial corridors are Sunset and Glendale boulevards.\n\nLocation\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times \"Mapping L.A.\" project, Echo Park is in Central Los Angeles, between Hollywood and Downtown Los Angeles. It is situated near the 101, the 2, and the 5 freeways.

It also maintains campuses in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, and in Well, Limburg, Netherlands (Kasteel Well). Founded in 1880 by Charles Wesley Emerson as a \"school of oratory,\" the college offers more than three dozen degree and professional training programs specializing in the fields of arts and communication with a foundation in liberal arts studies. The college is one of the founding members of the ProArts Consortium, an association of six neighboring institutions in Boston dedicated to arts education at the collegiate level. Emerson is also notable for the college's namesake public opinion poll, Emerson College Polling.\nOriginally based in Boston's Pemberton Square, the college moved neighborhoods several times, and is now located in the Theater District along the south side of the Boston Common. Emerson owns and operates the historic Colonial, Paramount, and Cutler Majestic theaters, as well as several smaller performance venues.\n\nHistory\nOrigins\nCharles Wesley Emerson founded the Boston Conservatory of Elocution, Oratory, and Dramatic Art in 1880, a year after Boston University closed its School of Oratory. Classes were held at Pemberton Square in Boston, where ten students enrolled in the conservatory's first class. The following year, the institution changed its name to the Monroe Conservatory of Oratory, in honor of Charles Emerson's teacher at Boston University's School of Oratory, Professor Lewis B. Monroe. In 1890, the name changed again to Emerson College of Oratory and was later shortened to Emerson College in 1939.\n\nEarly expansion and growth\nThe college expanded and rented space at 36 Bromfield Street, and moved to Odd Fellows Hall on Berkeley and Tremont Streets in the South End of Boston. With the new location, the college's first library was established in 1892. Henry Lawrence Southwick, a faculty member and alumnus, became a financial partner for the college with Emerson. This financial partnership led to the acquisition of the Boston School of Oratory from Moses T. Brown in 1894.\nAt the turn of the century, faculty members Henry and Jessie Eldridge Southwick and William H. Kenney purchased the college from Dr. Emerson. Soon after, the college rented a new location in Chickering Hall.\nDr. Emerson retired in 1903 and William J. Rolfe, a Shakespearean scholar and actor, was named the second President of Emerson College of Oratory. His service as president lasted until his retirement in 1908.\nAs the Student Government Association of the college held its first meeting in 1908, the third president of the college, Henry Lawrence Southwick, was inaugurated. He introduced the study of acting and stagecraft into the college curriculum. During his tenure, the college rented a new building at 30 Huntington Avenue in Copley Square. The college was also granted the right to award Bachelor of Literary Interpretation (B.L.I.) degrees. In addition, Emerson became the first school with a collegiate-level program in children's theater in 1919. The school offered its first course in Journalism in 1924.\nThe college purchased its first piece of real estate with a new women's dormitory building at 373 Commonwealth Avenue in the Back Bay, and started intramural sports in 1931 with the organization of volleyball games.\n\nAdministrative restructuring\nIn 1930, full charge and control of the college was transferred to the Board of Trustees by William H. Kenney, Henry Lawrence Southwick, and Jessie Eldridge Southwick.\nWhen Harry Seymour Ross was appointed the fourth president of Emerson College in 1931, the first course in Radio Broadcasting was taught by the program director of WEEI, a Boston AM radio station. The purchase of buildings at 130 Beacon Street and 128 Beacon Street a year later began the presence of Emerson College in Boston's Back Bay. Emerson kept ownership of these buildings until summer 2003.\nIn the following years, a professional training program in Speech Pathology (1935) and the first undergraduate program in Broadcast Journalism (1937) were offered for the first time in the United States. Construction of a theater behind 128\u2013130 Beacon began, and the institution was granted the right to award Master of Arts degrees.\n\nPost-war era\nIn the post-war era, the G.I. Bill of Rights and the Broadcasting curriculum contributed to the rebalancing of the student body from a primarily-female population to an equally-balanced population of men and women. Boylston Green, the first president to have no prior association with the college, used his background as a dean of students to enhance extracurricular activities, including the establishment of a student activities fee. These efforts led to the first publication of Emerson's student newspaper, The Berkeley Beacon, in 1947, which is still in production today.\nEmerson also saw major development in its broadcasting program. A one-year Certificate of Broadcasting was offered via evening classes. The FCC awarded the college a 10-watt license in 1949, and WERS, the first educational FM radio station in New England, was born. The station's power was increased to 300 watts three years later, and 18,000 watts by 1953.\nAt the start of the decade, in 1950, Emerson College became a member of the New England Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, an accreditation association for schools and colleges in New England.\nPresident Green left the college in 1949 after being selected as president of the University of the South, and Godfrey Dewey served as Acting President until 1951. At that time, Jonathon French was appointed as Acting President, and he became president in December of that year, despite never being formally inaugurated.\n\nFinancial crisis of 1952 and recovery\nThe college suffered from a severe financial crisis in 1952, and sought $50,000 in emergency funding. At the time, the Chairman of the Corporation stated that without these funds, the college had three alternatives: go broke, sell out, or merge with another institution. Led by the National Alumni Council, a grassroots campaign was launched to improve the financial situation of the college. The efforts led to the resignation of the Council of Trustees, which was then replaced mostly by alumni. The new board elected a former Emerson history professor, S. Justus McKinley, as the fifth President of Emerson College.\nPulling out of its financial crisis, the college started to develop its programs with new facilities. In 1953, Emerson opened The Robbins Speech, Language and Hearing Clinic at 145 Beacon Street, furthering the Communication Sciences and Disorders Program. A television studio was dedicated at 130 Beacon in 1954, with its first closed-circuit TV program the following year as WERS-TV. The first annual spring musical, Lady in the Dark by Moss Hart, was presented. Later, the school was authorized to grant honorary degrees, Bachelors and Masters of Science in speech, and a Bachelors of Music in conjunction with the Longy School of Music.\n\nBack Bay as Emerson's campus\nAs the 1960s started, 373 Commonwealth Avenue was sold to purchase a dormitory at 100 Beacon Street for 609 undergraduate and 29 graduate students. A year later, a building at 150 Beacon Street was obtained for dorms, a dining hall, and administrative offices. With major gifts from Elisabeth Abbot Smith and J.F. Buzzard, the college library moved from the fourth floor of 130 Beacon Street into its own building at 303 Berkeley Street. In 1964, two buildings were purchased: 96 Beacon Street, which became the student union building, and 132\u2013134 Beacon Street, which became a dormitory. The campus remained primarily in Back Bay until the late 1990s.\nIn 1967, Richard Chapin, former Dean of the Harvard Business School was inaugurated as the seventh president of Emerson College.\nShortly afterwards, an academic planning committee approved a new course of study for general education requirements. The first level of this program replaced the college-wide requirements with a two-year interdisciplinary course of study and electives. In order to accommodate this new program, the building at 67\u201369 Brimmer Street was purchased. The Institute of Interdisciplinary Studies was born. A year later in 1972, the college gained authorization} to grant BFA and MFA degrees.\n\nAttempted relocation\nThough Emerson College has moved to various locations within the city of Boston, the appointment of Allen E. Koenig (the ninth President of Emerson College) almost took the college completely outside of Boston. As soon as he was inaugurated in 1979, Koenig initiated talks with Pine Manor College in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts to relocate Emerson and merge the two schools. However, an agreement was never reached and the plan was dropped entirely.\nAt the start of the 1980s, Koenig made a proposal to the board of trustees for a major renovation of the college's facilities. The plan allowed for new performance spaces, classrooms, and faculty offices at Brimmer Street; remodeling the Library and Learning Resources Center at 150 Beacon; remodeling the 303 Berkeley building for the Humanities and Social Sciences Division; a new radio\/audio complex at 126 Beacon; and construction of two new television studios behind 130 Beacon. In 1984, 335 Commonwealth Avenue was purchased for Administration and the Communication Studies department. The college also received the authorization to grant MFA degrees in Creative Writing.\nDespite the newly purchased Commonwealth Avenue buildings, Lawrence, Massachusetts, was soon being discussed as a new location for Emerson College, about 44.5 km (27.7 mi) away from Boston. The Mayor of Lawrence announced that the necessary land would be taken by eminent domain and sold to Emerson for a token payment of $100. However, the five affected private landowners disagreed with this arrangement and fought the city in court. Three years later in 1988, Judge John Forte ruled in favor of the City of Lawrence. The river-front site in Lawrence was proposed as the new campus for the college. However, as real estate values in Boston dropped and the costs of constructing a new campus increased, the plans were put on hold and eventually abandoned when Koenig resigned as president in 1989. In 1988, the college bought a building at Zero Marlborough Street (also known as 6 Arlington Street) for dormitories and a dining hall.\n\nRebirth in the Historic Theater District\nJohn Zacharis became the tenth President of Emerson College and faced a college fractured by the failed move to Lawrence, Massachusetts. Over the course of two years, he worked to restore unity to the campus by purchasing a building at 180 Tremont Street, now called the Ansin Building. This purchase started a transition from Back Bay to the Boston Theater District. Zacharis went on medical leave in 1992 and died of leukemia shortly after.\nDuring Zacharis's leave, speech pathologist Jacqueline Weis Liebergott was appointed as Acting President and, a year later, inaugurated to become the first female president of the college. Shortly after, she submitted a 10-year master plan to the Boston Redevelopment Authority which involved moving the college to the Washington Street Theatre District.\nIn the mid-1990s, a planning document of the college's future plans was drafted and public hearings were held. The college also extended health care benefits to domestic partners of gay and lesbian faculty, administration and staff. Under the plan, dental coverage and tuition waivers were also available. That same year, the college debuted online with a $100,000 gift from Mrs. Mary E. Tufte. Financed by the contribution, The Tufte Lab was placed on the fourth floor of the Ansin Building and dedicated in Mrs. Tufte's honor. The lab was the catalyst for a telecommunications\/fiber optic network installation, which was completed in October 1995.\nIn addition, the college announced the purchase and restoration of The Little Building (1994) across the street from the Ansin Building and next to Emerson's Majestic Theatre. Restoration was completed on the facades of the college's buildings at 126, 128, 130, 132\u2013134, 168 Beacon Street, and 21 Commonwealth Avenue.\nIn 1998, Emerson purchased the Walker Building (Boston) at 120 Boylston. The building currently hosts the school's Department of Television, Radio, Film Production, the Institutional Advancement (Alumni and Development) department, and the Government and Community Relations department. It also contains the school's library and many of its classrooms.\n\n21st century\nThe Tufte Performance Production Center (PPC) at 10 Boylston Place opened in 2003. The 11-story steel-and-glass building houses the Department of Performing Arts and includes two theaters (The Semel Theatre and The Greene Theatre), two television studios, makeup and costume labs, faculty offices, and an exhibition area. Also that year, the Cutler Majestic Theatre finished renovations and re-opened as one of the main stages of Emerson Stage productions.\nCirca 2001 Emerson adjuncts voted to establish a union and in 2004 ratified its first contract with the college. The Affiliated Faculty of Emerson College, American Association of University Professors (AFEC-AAUP) represents 240 adjunct faculty members at Emerson College as of 2022.\nIn 2004, it was announced that the buildings at 96, 100, and 132 Beacon had been sold and would be vacated by the Fall 2006 semester. Construction of a new 14-story residence hall at 150 Boylston Street began in March 2004, and was completed in September 2006. It is the first entirely-new residence hall in Emerson's history. The facility includes residential suites, athletic facilities, offices and meeting rooms for student organizations, informal gathering places for off-campus students, spaces for small-group rehearsals and performances, and dining facilities.\nThe school purchased Boston's historic Paramount Theatre on Washington Street in 2005, with plans to build a new complex at the site including a 565-seat main stage theater inside the existing Paramount Theater and a 125-seat black box theater in an adjacent new building. Plans also included a 200-seat film screening room, eight rehearsal studios ranging from 700 to 1,900 square feet (65 to 177 m2), six smaller rehearsal spaces, a sound stage for film students, a new scene shop, and a dormitory.\nIn May 2006, the Campus Center in the Piano Row building was named the Max Mutchnick Campus Center after a major gift from the 1987 graduate and co-creator of the television sitcom Will & Grace. In the same year, the school exercised its purchase option on the Colonial Theatre, adjacent to the Little Building, and then converted the upper floors of the building to a 372-bed dormitory. With the addition of dorm space here and at the Paramount Theatre, the school hoped to accommodate up to 75% of its students in on-campus housing by 2010.\nIn September 2006, a long-running labor dispute between the administrators and faculty union was resolved. The administration limited the union's role in promotion and tenure, and brought department chairs into administrative roles, where they were not covered by the union. In response, the college agreed not to dismantle the union.\nIn September 2007, students in Emerson Alliance for Gays, Lesbians, and Everyone (E.A.G.L.E.) as well as the Student Government Association (S.G.A.) received the gender neutral bathrooms they had pitched to the administration in the spring. In September 2016, every bathroom on Emerson's campus was converted into a gender inclusive restroom.\nOn December 2, 2009, President Liebergott announced she would step down in June 2011. On September 8, 2010, the college announced she would be succeeded by M. Lee Pelton of Willamette University.\nOn March 18, 2010, the newly renovated Paramount Center officially opened, with Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino illuminating the Paramount's original art deco marquee, which Emerson had restored. In addition to the 590-seat Paramount Theatre, the Paramount Center also houses an experimental black box theater, the Bright Family Screening Room, a sound stage, a scene\/prop production shop, nine rehearsal studios, six practice rooms, four classrooms, 20 faculty offices, and a student commons area.\nAs of 2014, two students are suing the college for mishandling their rape cases and failing to provide their Title IX rights.\nIn late 2019, Marlboro College announced that it would merge with Emerson at the end of the 2019\u201320 academic year. Under the agreement, finalized on July 23, 2020, Marlboro gave its endowment to Emerson, which created the Marlboro Institute of Liberal Arts and Interdisciplinary Studies. Marlboro students were guaranteed admission and tenure-track faculty were guaranteed teaching positions at Emerson. At that time, Marlboro had approximately 150 students.\nIn December 2020, President Lee Pelton announced his planned departure from Emerson College in June 2021 to assume a new role as CEO and President of the Boston Foundation.  Jay M. Bernhardt became the 13th president of Emerson College on June 1, 2023, after serving as dean of the Moody College of Communication at the University of Texas at Austin. On the day of his investiture ceremony, a protest for Palestinian liberation led to the arrest of 13 individuals, 12 of which were Emerson students. Additionally, 11 of those arrested were people of color. On April 25, 2024, 118 Emerson students were arrested (and several injured) after Boston Police cleared an encampment that was part of the nationwide college protests against the Israel-Hamas War.\n\nCampus\nEmerson College's permanent move from the Back Bay to its current location revitalized and preserved the distinct character and profiles of the surrounding neighborhoods, which comprise many significant historic landmarks and structures - the most notable being Boston Public Garden and Boston Common. Presently, the majority of the college's acquired properties were reclaimed, renovated and\/or restored without having to introduce new developments into the Downtown core. Abutting the southeast corner of the Boston Common, the 8-acre urban campus at the intersection of Boylston Street and Tremont Street is served by Boylston station on the MBTA Green Line and Chinatown station on the Orange Line. In addition, Emerson College extends its campus outside Massachusetts state, operating in a fourteenth-century castle in the Netherlands and a major academic center on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood for its long-established Los Angeles program.\n\nAcademic and theater buildings\nAnsin Building (180 Tremont Street)\nOnce owned by the Boston Edison Company, the Ansin Building was purchased by Emerson in 1992.

In 2005, Emerson College announced plans to renovate the Paramount Theatre, building an entire performing arts facility in and around the theatre. The renovated Paramount Center was designed by Elkus Manfredi Architects of Boston and built by Bond Brothers, and completed in 2010.\nThe project included not only renovating the Paramount Theatre into a 550-seat theater, but building both a new Performance Development Center and a new residence hall for the school on the 6th through 9th floors of the building. The complex features the 120-seat Liebergott Black Box Theatre, the 174-seat Bright Family Screening Room, nine rehearsal studios ranging from 700 to 1,900 square feet (65 to 177 m2), five practice rooms for individuals and small groups, a sound stage for film production classes, a scene shop, several classrooms, a restaurant, and Emerson faculty and staff offices.\n\nLittle Building (80 Boylston Street)\nEmerson College purchased the building in 1994 and converted it into a 750-bed dormitory, which opened in September 1995.  In 2016, the college unveiled plans to do a complete renovation of the Little Building, which would replace and restore the building's fa\u00e7ade and add an additional floor behind the parapet on the top of the building, adding approximately 300 beds.  The renovated dorm opened for the Fall 2019 semester and now houses up to 1,035 residents.\n\n2 Boylston Place\n2 Boylston Place is the most recent addition to the campus, It opened in 2017, and contains an 18-story residence hall that houses approximately 375 students.\n\nExternal programs\nELA\u2014Hollywood Center (Los Angeles)\nSituated on Sunset Boulevard (at Gordon St) in Hollywood, the Emerson Los Angeles (ELA) building is a permanent home to Emerson's decades-old Los Angeles program. The international design firm Morphosis, headed by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Thom Mayne, designed a signature building incorporating residential, teaching and administrative spaces. The 10-story building was opened for the college's winter semester in 2014. The new facility accommodates 217 students, approximately twice the number of students that were supported by Emerson's older facility in Burbank. The center allows undergraduate students to spend a full fall, spring or summer semester taking classes in Hollywood and participating in a semester-long internship at enterprises related to their field of study. In addition, ELA also offers professional training and workplace education for Los Angeles-area professionals who are not enrolled in the college degree programs.\n\nKasteel Well in the Netherlands\nEmerson College owns and operates Kasteel Well in the rural province of Limburg, Netherlands, a national historical monument that provides living accommodations, classrooms, a resource center, and related facilities. Approximately 85 matriculated Emerson students attend the program each semester, and are chosen through a lottery-style system. Classes are taught by Dutch teachers, with several Belgian and other teachers from Europe on staff.\n\nThe Max Mutchnick Campus Center and the Bobbi Brown and Steven Plofker Gymnasium are important campus buildings. The former features several conference, meeting, and rehearsal spaces open to all students, offices for Student Life and the Student Government Association, and storage for any student organization. Also housing new offices for the Athletics Department, it is Emerson College's first-ever indoor athletic facility. The construction of the gym was controversial at the time of its announcement, considering the lack of performing space on campus and the lack of enthusiasm around athletics at Emerson.\n\nAcademics\nEmerson College is divided into two schools (School of Communication and School of the Arts) and eight departments (Marketing Communication; Communication Studies; Journalism; Communication Sciences & Disorders; Performing Arts; Writing, Literature & Publishing; Visual & Media Arts; Liberal Arts & Interdisciplinary Studies) offering 31 undergraduate majors and 19 minors (Bachelor of Arts\/Fine Arts, or Science), and 12 graduate degree programs (Master of Arts\/Fine Arts, or Science).

The company holds bi-annual showcases at the end of every semester highlighting student dancers and choreographers, all of whom have auditioned at the start of every semester and applied to choreograph through a selection process run by the company's executive board.\nEmerson Dance Company (commonly referred to as EDC) also offers master classes, workshops, and events which are open to the entire Emerson community. In addition to participating in internal college activities, the group also engages in community service around the Boston area. The organization is actively involved with its alumni (inviting one back each semester to choreograph an alumni piece), as well as fellow college and professional level dance organizations around the Boston area (i.e. The Boston Ballet, Suffolk Dance, Northeastern Dance Company {NUDANCO}, and Urbanity Dance). The company has been advised by Senior Dancer-In-Residence in the college's Performing Arts Department, Marlena Yannetti, since its inception. Emerson Dance Company uses Emerson's theatres, including the newly renovated Paramount Center Mainstage.\n\nStudent radio\nWECB is the campus student run radio station, overseen by a faculty advisor. WECB broadcasts online at its website and on closed-circuit campus television (channel 56).\nIn 1983\u201384, WECB was scheduled for demolition without reconstruction, as part of the Mass Communications $1.6M renovation project. Carol Kamerschen, Greg Weremey, Barry Scott and Russ Weisenbacher were instrumental in fighting the board of trustees, and convincing them to allow Weremey and Weisenbacher to design and build new studios at 126 Beacon Street, replacing the former facilities at 130 Beacon Street, 4th floor.\nETIN (Emerson's Talk and Information Network), an online talk radio service run by students, is also housed in the same space as WERS and WECB.\n\nComedy\nThe college has a long tradition in the comedy community, including student groups specializing in various combinations of sketch comedy, improvisation, and short films.

He was born in Omaha, Nebraska, raised primarily in Texas, and lived much of his life in Portland, Oregon, where he gained popularity. Smith's primary instrument was the guitar, though he also played piano, clarinet, bass guitar, drums, and harmonica. He had a distinctive vocal style in his solo career after Heatmiser, characterized by his \"whispery, spiderweb-thin delivery\", and often used multi-tracking to create vocal layers, textures, and harmonies that were usually finger picked and recorded with tape.\nAfter playing in the rock band Heatmiser for several years, Smith began his solo career in 1994, with releases on the independent record labels Cavity Search and Kill Rock Stars (KRS). In 1997, he signed a contract with DreamWorks Records, for which he recorded his final two albums. Smith rose to mainstream prominence when his song \"Miss Misery\"\u2014included in the soundtrack for the film Good Will Hunting (1997)\u2014was nominated for the 1998 Academy Award for Best Original Song.\nSmith was a heavy drinker and drug user, and was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and depression. His struggles with drugs and mental illness affected his life and work and often informed his lyrics. He died at his Los Angeles home from two stab wounds to the chest at age 34 in 2003. The autopsy evidence did not determine whether the wounds were self-inflicted. At the time of his death, Smith was working on his album From a Basement on the Hill,  posthumously produced and released in 2004.\n\nEarly life\nSteven Paul Smith was born on August 6, 1969, at the Methodist Hospital in Omaha, Nebraska, the only child of Gary Smith, a student at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, and Bunny Kay Berryman, an elementary school music teacher. His parents divorced when he was six months old, and Smith moved with his mother to Duncanville, Texas. He had half-siblings through his mother, Darren Welch and Ashley Welch, and a half-sister Rachel Smith through his father. Smith later had a tattoo of a map of Texas drawn on his upper arm and said: \"I didn't get it because I like Texas, kind of the opposite. But I won't forget about it, although I'm tempted to because I don't like it there.\"\nSmith endured a difficult childhood and a troubled relationship with his stepfather Charlie Welch. Smith stated he may have been sexually abused by Welch at a young age, an allegation that Welch has denied. He wrote about this part of his life in \"Some Song\". The name \"Charlie\" also appears in songs \"Flowers for Charlie\" and \"No Confidence Man\". In a 2004 interview, Jennifer Chiba, Smith's partner at the time of his death, said that Smith's difficult childhood was partly why he needed to sedate himself with drugs as an adult: \"He was remembering traumatic things from his childhood \u2013 parts of things. It's not my place to say what.\"\nFor much of his childhood, Smith's family was a part of the Community of Christ but began attending services at a local Methodist church. Smith felt that going to church did little for him, except make him \"really scared of Hell\". In 2001, he said: \"I don't necessarily buy into any officially structured version of spirituality. But I have my own version of it.\"\nSmith began playing piano at age nine, and at ten began learning guitar on a small acoustic guitar bought for him by his father. At this age he composed an original piano piece, \"Fantasy\", which won him a prize at an arts festival. Many of the people on his mother's side of the family were non-professional musicians; his grandfather was a Dixieland drummer, and his grandmother sang in a glee club.\n\nAt fourteen, Smith left his mother's home in Texas and moved to Portland, Oregon, to live with his father, who was then working as a psychiatrist. It was around this time that Smith began using drugs, including alcohol, with friends. He also began experimenting with recording for the first time after borrowing a four-track recorder. At high school, Smith played clarinet in the school band and played guitar and piano; he also sang in the bands Stranger Than Fiction and A Murder of Crows, billed as either Steven Smith or \"Johnny Panic\". His bandmates included Jason Hornick. He graduated from Lincoln High School as a National Merit Scholar.\nAfter graduation, Smith began calling himself \"Elliott\", saying that he thought \"Steve\" sounded too much like a \"jock\" name, and that \"Steven\" sounded \"too bookish\". According to friends, he had also used the pseudonym \"Elliott Stillwater-Rotter\" during his time in the band A Murder of Crows. Biographer S. R. Shutt speculates that the name was either inspired by Elliott Avenue, a street that Smith had lived on in Portland, or that it was suggested by his then-girlfriend. A junior high acquaintance of Smith speculates Smith changed his name so as not to be confused with Steve Smith, the drummer of Journey.\n\nCareer\n1991\u20131996: Heatmiser\nIn 1991 Smith graduated from Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts with a degree in philosophy and political science. \"Went straight through in four years\", he explained to Under the Radar in 2003. \"I guess it proved to myself that I could do something I really didn't want to for four years. Except I did like what I was studying. At the time it seemed like, 'This is your one and only chance to go to college and you had just better do it because some day you might wish that you did.' Plus, the whole reason I applied in the first place was because of my girlfriend, and I had gotten accepted already even though we had broken up before the first day.\" After he graduated, he \"worked in a bakery back in Portland with a bachelor's degree in philosophy and legal theory\".\nWhile at Hampshire College, Smith formed the band Heatmiser with classmate Neil Gust. After Smith graduated from Hampshire, the band added drummer Tony Lash and bassist Brandt Peterson and began performing around Portland in 1992. The group released the albums Dead Air (1993) and Cop and Speeder (1994), as well as the Yellow No. 5 EP (1994) on Frontier Records. They were then signed to Virgin Records to release what became their final album Mic City Sons (1996).\nAround this time, Smith and Gust worked a number of odd jobs around Portland, including installing drywall, spreading gravel, transplanting bamboo trees, and painting the roof of a warehouse with heat reflective paint. The pair were also on unemployment benefits for some time, which they considered an \"artist grant\".\nSmith had begun his solo career while still in Heatmiser, and the success of his first two releases created distance and tension with his band. Heatmiser disbanded prior to the release of Mic City Sons, prompting Virgin to put the album out inauspiciously through its independent arm Caroline Records. A clause in Heatmiser's record contract with Virgin meant that Smith was still bound to it as an individual. The contract was later bought out by DreamWorks prior to the recording of his album XO.\n\n1994: Roman Candle\nIn the early 1990s, Smith's girlfriend at the time convinced him to send a tape of songs he had recently recorded on a borrowed four-track to Cavity Search Records. Cavity owner Christopher Cooper asked to release the entire album of songs, which surprised Smith, as he was expecting only a deal for a seven-inch record. The album became Smith's release Roman Candle (1994).\nSmith said: \"I thought my head would be chopped off immediately when it came out because at the time it was so opposite to the grunge thing that was popular ... The thing is that album was really well received, which was a total shock, and it immediately eclipsed [Heatmiser], unfortunately.\" Smith felt his solo songs were not representative of the music Heatmiser was making: \"The idea of playing [my music] for people didn't occur to me ... because at the time it was the Northwest\u2014Mudhoney and Nirvana\u2014and going out to play an acoustic show was like crawling out on a limb and begging for it to be sawed off.\"\nOne of Smith's first solo performances was in Portland at the now-defunct Umbra Penumbra on September 17, 1994. Only three songs from Roman Candle were performed, with the majority of the ten-song set being B-sides, Heatmiser tunes and unreleased tracks. The same year, Smith released a split 7-inch record with Pete Krebs via Slo-Mo Records, contributing the track \"No Confidence Man\".\n\n1995\u20131997: Elliott Smith and Either\/Or\nIn 1995, Smith's self-titled album was released on Kill Rock Stars; the record featured a style of recording similar to Roman Candle, but with hints of growth and experimentation. Though the majority of the album was recorded by Smith alone, friend and The Spinanes vocalist Rebecca Gates sang harmony vocals on \"St. Ides Heaven\", and Heatmiser guitarist Neil Gust played guitar on \"Single File\". Several songs made reference to drugs, but Smith explained that he used the theme of drugs as a vehicle for conveying dependence rather than the songs being about drugs specifically. Looking back, Smith felt that the album's pervasive mood gave him \"a reputation for being a really dark, depressed person\" and said that he later made a conscious move toward more diverse moods in his music.\n\nIn 1996, filmmaker Jem Cohen recorded Smith playing acoustic songs for the short film Lucky Three: An Elliott Smith Portrait. Two of these songs would appear on his next album Either\/Or, which was another Kill Rock Stars release. Either\/Or came out in 1997 to favorable reviews. The album found Smith venturing further into full instrumentation, with several songs containing bass guitar, drums, keyboards, and electric guitars, all played by Smith. The album title was derived from the two-volume book of the same name by Danish philosopher S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, whose works generally deal with themes such as existential despair, angst, death, and God.\nBy this time, Smith's already-heavy drinking was being compounded with use of antidepressants. At the end of the Either\/Or tour, some of his close friends staged an intervention in Chicago, but it proved ineffective. Shortly after, Smith relocated from Portland to Jersey City, New Jersey, and later Brooklyn, New York.\n\n1997\u20131998: \"Miss Misery\" and Academy Award nomination\nIn 1997, Smith was selected by director and fellow Portland resident Gus Van Sant to be a part of the soundtrack to his film Good Will Hunting. Smith recorded an orchestral version of \"Between the Bars\" with composer Danny Elfman for the movie. Smith also contributed a new song, \"Miss Misery\", and three previously released tracks (\"No Name #3\", from Roman Candle, and \"Angeles\" and \"Say Yes\", from Either\/Or). The film was a commercial and critical success, and Smith was nominated for an Academy Award for \"Miss Misery\". Not eager to step into the limelight, he agreed to perform the song at the ceremony only after the producers informed him that if he was unwilling to perform, they would choose someone else to play it.\nOn March 5, 1998, Smith made an appearance on Late Night with Conan O'Brien performing \"Miss Misery\" solo on acoustic guitar. A few days later, wearing a white suit, he played an abridged version of the song at the Academy Awards ceremony, accompanied by the house orchestra. Smith did not voice disappointment about not winning. He described the experience as surreal, and said: \"The Oscars was a very strange show, where the set was only one song cut down to less than two minutes, and the audience was a lot of people who didn't come to hear me play. I wouldn't want to live in that world, but it was fun to walk around on the moon for a day.\"\n\n1998\u20132000: XO and Figure 8\nIn 1998, after the success of Either\/Or and \"Miss Misery\", Smith signed to a bigger record label, DreamWorks Records. Around the same time, Smith fell into depression, speaking openly of considering suicide, and on at least one occasion made a serious attempt at ending his own life. While in North Carolina, he became severely intoxicated and ran off a cliff. He landed on a tree, which badly impaled him but broke his fall. When questioned about his suicide attempt, he told an interviewer \"Yeah, I jumped off a cliff, but let's talk about something else.\"\nChristopher Cooper, head of Cavity Search Records (which released Roman Candle), said about this time in Smith's life, \"I talked him out of thinking that he wanted to kill himself numerous times when he was in Portland, Oregon. I kept telling him that he was a brilliant man, and that life was worth living, and that people loved him.\" Pete Krebs also agreed: \"In Portland we got the brunt of Elliott's initial depression ... Lots of people have stories of their own experiences of staying up with Elliott 'til five in the morning, holding his hand, telling him not to kill himself.\"\nSmith's first release for DreamWorks was later that year. Titled XO, it was conceived and developed while Smith wrote it out over the winter of 1997\/1998, night after night seated at the bar in Luna Lounge. It was produced by the team of Rob Schnapf and Tom Rothrock. XO also contained some instrumentation from Los Angeles musicians Joey Waronker and Jon Brion. It contained a more full-sounding, baroque pop sound than any of his previous efforts, with songs featuring a horn section, Chamberlins, elaborate string arrangements, and even a drum loop on the song \"Independence Day\". His familiar double-tracked vocal and acoustic guitar style were still apparent while his somewhat personal lyrical style survived. The album went on to peak at number 104 on the Billboard 200 and number 123 on the UK Album Charts, while selling 400,000 copies (more than double that of each of his two Kill Rock Stars releases), becoming the best-selling release of his career. Smith's backing band during most of this period was the Portland-based group Quasi, consisting of former bandmate Sam Coomes on bass guitar and Coomes's ex-wife Janet Weiss on drums. Quasi also performed as the opening act at many shows on the tour, with Smith sometimes contributing bass guitar, guitar, or backing vocals. On October 17, 1998, Smith appeared on Saturday Night Live and performed \"Waltz No. 2 (XO)\". His backing band for this appearance was John Moen, Jon Brion, Rob Schnapf, and Sam Coomes.\nIn response to whether the change to a bigger record label would influence his creative control, Smith said, \"I think despite the fact that sometimes people look at major labels as simply money-making machines, they're actually composed of individuals who are real people, and there's a part of them that needs to feel that part of their job is to put out good music.\" Smith also claimed in another interview that he never read his reviews for fear that they would interfere with his songwriting. It was during this period that Smith appeared on Dutch television in 1998 and provided a candid interview in which he spoke of his assessment of his music career until that point:\n\nYeah, I don't know. I mean, I mostly only know things are different because people ask me different questions, but I don't feel like things are very changed. I mean, I still, I do the same things that I did before \u2026 I think about the same things, so \u2026 I'm the wrong kind of person to be really big and famous.\nAs part of the Dutch television special, Smith played live versions of \"Waltz No. 2 (XO)\", \"Miss Misery\", and \"I Didn't Understand\"\u2014the latter two songs were performed solely on piano, while the first song was cut short by Smith, as he explained: \"I had to stop it because it's\u2026 you know, what's the point of playing a song badly? It'd be better to play it and mean it, than to just walk through it.\"\n\nSmith relocated from Brooklyn to Los Angeles in 1999, taking up residence at a cabin in the Silver Lake section of town, where he would regularly play intimate, acoustic shows at local venues like Silverlake Lounge. He also performed in Toronto in April that year. In the fall, his cover of the Beatles' \"Because\" was featured in the end credits of DreamWorks' Oscar-winning drama American Beauty, and appeared on the film's soundtrack album.\nFigure 8, the final album Smith completed, was released on April 18, 2000. It featured the return of Rothrock, Schnapf, Brion, and Waronker and was partially recorded at Abbey Road Studios in England, with an obvious Beatles influence in the songwriting and production. The album garnered favorable reviews, and peaked at number 99 on the Billboard 200 and 37 on the UK Album Charts. The album received praise for its power pop style and complex arrangements, described as creating a \"sweeping kaleidoscope of layered instruments and sonic textures\". However, some reviewers felt that Smith's trademark dark and melancholy songwriting had lost some of its subtlety, with one reviewer likening some of the lyrics to \"the self-pitying complaints of an adolescent venting in his diary\".\nAlbum art and promotional pictures from the period showed Smith looking cleaned-up and put-together. An extensive tour in promotion of the record ensued, book-ended by television appearances on Late Night with Conan O'Brien and the Late Show with David Letterman. However, Smith's condition began to deteriorate as he had become addicted to heroin either towards the end of or just after the Figure 8 tour.\n\n2001\u20132002: Addiction and scrapped recordings\nAround the time he began recording his final album, Smith began to display signs of paranoia, often believing that a white van followed him wherever he went. He would have friends drop him off for recording sessions almost a mile away from the studio, and to reach the location, he would trudge through hundreds of yards of brush and cliffs. He started telling people that DreamWorks was out to get him: \"Not long ago my house was broken into, and songs were stolen off my computer which have wound up in the hands of certain people who work at a certain label. I've also been followed around for months at a time. I wouldn't even want to necessarily say it's the people from that label who are following me around, but it was probably them who broke into my house.\" During this period, Smith hardly ate, subsisting primarily on ice cream. He would go without sleeping for several days and then sleep for an entire day.\nA follow-up to Smith's 2000 album was originally planned to happen with Rob Schnapf, but their sessions were abandoned. Smith also began distancing himself from manager Margaret Mittleman, who had handled him since the Roman Candle days. He finally began recording a new album with only himself and Jon Brion as producers sometime during 2001. The pair had recorded a substantial amount of music for the album when Brion stopped the sessions because of Smith's struggle with substance use disorder. Their friendship promptly ended, and Smith scrapped all of their work until that point. He later said \"There was even a little more than half of a record done before this new one that I just scrapped because of a blown friendship with someone that made me so depressed I didn't want to hear any of those songs. He was just helping me record the songs and stuff, and then the friendship kind of fell apart all of a sudden one day. It just made it kind of awkward being alone in the car listening to the songs.\"\nWhen Brion sent a bill for the abandoned sessions to DreamWorks, executives Lenny Waronker and Luke Wood scheduled a meeting with Smith to determine what went wrong with the sessions. Smith complained of intrusion upon his personal life from the label, as well as poor promotion for the Figure 8 album. The talks proved fruitless, and soon after, Smith sent a message to the executives, stating that if they did not release him from his contract, he would take his own life. In May 2001, Smith set out to re-record the album, mostly on his own, but with some help from David McConnell of Goldenboy. McConnell told Spin that, during this time, Smith smoked over $1,500 worth of heroin and crack per day, often talked about suicide, and on numerous occasions tried to give himself an overdose. Steven Drozd of The Flaming Lips and Scott McPherson of Sense Field played a few drum tracks, Sam Coomes contributed some bass guitar and backing vocals, but almost every other instrument was recorded by Smith.\nSmith's song \"Needle in the Hay\" was included in Wes Anderson's 2001 film The Royal Tenenbaums during a suicide attempt scene. Smith was originally supposed to contribute a cover of The Beatles' \"Hey Jude\" for the film, but when he failed to do so in time, Anderson had to use The Mutato Muzika Orchestra's version of the track instead. Anderson would later say that Smith \"was in a bad state\" at the time.\nSmith's live performances during 2001 and 2002 were infrequent, typically in the Pacific Northwest or Los Angeles. A review of his December 20, 2001, show at Portland's Crystal Ballroom expressed concern over his appearance and performance: his hair was uncharacteristically greasy and long, his face was bearded and gaunt, and during his songs he exhibited alarming signs of \"memory-loss and butterfingers\". At another performance in San Francisco that month, the audience began shouting out lyrics when Smith could not remember them.\nIn the first of only three concerts performed in 2002, Smith co-headlined Northwestern University's A&O Ball with Wilco on May 2 in Chicago. He was onstage for nearly an hour but failed to complete half of the songs. He claimed that his poor performance was due to his left hand having fallen asleep and told the audience it felt \"like having stuff on your hand and you can't get it off\". Smith's performance was reviewed as \"undoubtedly one of the worst performances ever by a musician\" and an \"excruciating [\u2026] nightmare\". A reporter for the online magazine Glorious Noise wrote, \"It would not surprise me at all if Elliott Smith ends up dead within a year.\"\nOn November 25, 2002, Smith was involved in a brawl with the Los Angeles Police Department at a concert where The Flaming Lips and Beck were performing. The officers allegedly beat and arrested him and girlfriend Jennifer Chiba. The two spent the night in jail. Smith's back was injured in the incident, causing him to cancel a number of shows. Wayne Coyne, lead singer of The Flaming Lips and a friend of Smith's, stated concern over Smith's appearance and actions, saying that he \"saw a guy who had lost control of himself. He was needy, he was grumpy, he was everything you wouldn't want in a person. It's not like when you think of Keith Richards being pleasantly blissed out in the corner.\"\n\n2003: Reemergence and From a Basement on the Hill\nSmith had attempted to go to rehab several times, but found that he was unable to relate to the popular treatments for people with substance use disorder who used a twelve-step program basis for treatment. \"I couldn't do the first step ... I couldn't say what you were supposed to say and mean it.\" In 2002, Smith went to the Neurotransmitter Restoration Center in Beverly Hills to start a course of treatment for substance use disorder. In one of his final interviews, he spoke about the center: \"What they do is an IV treatment where they put a needle in your arm, and you're on a drip bag, but the only thing that's in the drip bag is amino acids and saline solution. I was coming off of a lot of psych meds and other things. I was even on an antipsychotic, although I'm not psychotic.\"\nTwo sold-out solo acoustic concerts at Hollywood's Henry Fonda Theater, on January 31 and February 1, 2003, saw Smith attempting to reestablish his credibility as a live performer. Before the show, Smith scrawled \"Kali \u2013 the Destroyer\" (the Hindu goddess associated with time and change) in large block letters with permanent ink on his left arm, which was visible to the crowd during the performance. On several songs, he was backed by a stripped-down drum kit played by Robin Peringer (of the band 764-HERO), and members of opening band Rilo Kiley contributed backing vocals to one song. Near the end of the first show, the musician responded for several minutes after a heckler yelled \"Get a backbone\". Smith played two more Los Angeles concerts that year: The Derby in May 2003, and the L.A. Weekly Music Awards in June 2003.\nAfter his 34th birthday on August 6, 2003, he gave up alcohol. Director Mike Mills had been working with Smith during his final years and described Smith's troubles and apparent recovery: \"I gave the script to him, then he dropped off the face of the earth ... he went through his whole crazy time, but by the time I was done with the film, he was making From a Basement on the Hill and I was shocked that he was actually making music.\"\n\nWith things improving for Smith after several troubled years, he began experimenting with noise music and worked on his girlfriend Jennifer Chiba's iMac with the intent of learning how to record with computers, noting that it was the only method with which he was still unfamiliar. Smith jokingly labeled his experimental way of recording \"The California Frown\" (a play on the Beach Boys' \"California Sound\"). He said  \"They're kind of more noisy with the pitch all distorted. Some are more acoustic, but there aren't too many like that. Lately I've just been making up a lot of noise.\"\nHe was also in the process of recording songs for the Thumbsucker soundtrack, including Big Star's \"Thirteen\" and Cat Stevens's \"Trouble\". In August 2003, Suicide Squeeze Records put out a limited-edition vinyl single for \"Pretty (Ugly Before)\", a song that Smith had been playing since the Figure 8 tour. Smith's final show was at Redfest at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City on September 19, 2003. The final song he played live was \"Long, Long, Long\" by the Beatles.\n\n2004\u2013present: Posthumous releases\nFrom a Basement on the Hill, almost four years in production, was released on October 19, 2004, by ANTI- Records (a part of Epitaph Records). With Smith's family in control of his estate, they chose to bring in Rob Schnapf and Smith's ex-girlfriend Joanna Bolme to sort through the recordings and mix the album. Although Smith had voiced his desire for it to be a double album or a regular album with a bonus disc, it was not clear whether it would have been possible for him to release it that way had he completed it. As completed by Schnapf and Bolme, it was released as a 15-track single album. Many songs from the sessions (later leaked onto the Internet) were not included, such as \"True Love\", \"Everything's OK\", \"Stickman\", and \"Suicide Machine\" (a reworking of the Figure 8-era unreleased instrumental \"Tiny Time Machine\"). There has been unconfirmed speculation that Smith's family made the decision not to include some songs on the record due to their lyrical content, although songs such as \"King's Crossing\" that deal with darker subjects did make the album.\nElliott Smith and the Big Nothing, a biography by Benjamin Nugent, was rushed to publication shortly after From a Basement on the Hill, shortly after the first anniversary of his death. Smith's family, as well as Joanna Bolme, Jennifer Chiba, Neil Gust, Sam Coomes, and Janet Weiss, all declined to be interviewed. It contained interviews with Rob Schnapf, David McConnell, and Pete Krebs. The book received mixed reviews, with Publishers Weekly remarking that while \"Nugent manages to patch together the major beats of Smith's life, he can offer little meaningful insight\".\nIn 2005, a tribute album, A Tribute to Elliott Smith, was released. It featured various bands performing tributes to Smith. On May 8, 2007, a posthumous  compilation album New Moon, was released by Kill Rock Stars. It contained 24 songs recorded by Smith between 1994 and 1997 during his tenure with the label, songs that were not included on albums, as well as a few early versions and previously released B-sides. In the United States, the album debuted at number 24 on the Billboard 200, selling about 24,000 copies in its first week. The record received favorable reviews and was Metacritic's 15th best-reviewed album of 2007. A portion of the proceeds from album sales were to go to Outside In, a social service agency for low-income adults and homeless youth in Portland, Oregon.\nOn October 25, 2007, a book titled Elliott Smith was released by Autumn de Wilde, which consists of photographs, handwritten lyrics, and \"revealing talks with Smith's inner circle\". De Wilde was responsible for the Figure 8 sleeve art, making a landmark and de facto Smith memorial of the Solutions Audio mural. A five-song CD featuring previously unreleased live recordings of Smith performing acoustically at Largo in Los Angeles was included in the release.\nFollowing Smith's death, his estate licensed his songs for use in film and television projects such as One Tree Hill, The Girl Next Door, Georgia Rule, and Paranoid Park. In a March 2009 interview, Larry Crane said that Smith's estate was defunct and all rights previously held by Smith are now in the control of his parents. Crane went on to say that his parents own the rights to Smith's high school recordings, some of the Heatmiser material, all solo songs recorded until his 1998 record deal with DreamWorks Records, and From a Basement on the Hill. DreamWorks Records was acquired by Universal Music Group in 2003, and Interscope Records currently \"owns all studio and live recording from Jan 1998 to his passing, except for the songs on From a Basement on the Hill.\"\nIn December 2009, Kill Rock Stars announced that it had obtained the rights to re-release Roman Candle and From a Basement on the Hill, originally released by Cavity Search and ANTI-, respectively. Roman Candle would be remastered by Larry Crane. Along with the press release, Kill Rock Stars posted a previously unreleased track of Smith's, titled \"Cecilia\/Amanda\", as a free download. Roman Candle and From a Basement on the Hill were re-released on April 6, 2010, in the US.\nA greatest hits compilation titled An Introduction to... Elliott Smith was released in November 2010 by Domino Records (UK) and Kill Rock Stars (US).\nIn August 2013, there was a memorial concert in Portland, Oregon, and three other cities. Attending the Portland show were several musicians Smith had performed with, friends, and an appearance by film director Gus Van Sant.\nIn 2014, the director Paul Thomas Anderson posted a video of the pilot episode for a show called The Jon Brion Show, featuring an acoustic set by Smith including accompaniment by Brion and pianist Brad Mehldau.\nOn July 17, 2015, a documentary about Smith's life titled Heaven Adores You saw a limited theatrical release. The documentary enlisted a number of close friends and family members, as well as hours of audio interviews throughout Smith's short career. The film was directed by Nickolas Rossi and released through Eagle Rock Entertainment. Heaven Adores You received positive reviews from Consequence of Sound, The Guardian, and The Hollywood Reporter.\nOn August 6, 2019 (what would have been Smith's 50th birthday), UMe released digital deluxe editions of the two albums XO and Figure 8. The new edition of XO has nine added tracks, including Smith's Oscar-nominated Good Will Hunting song \"Miss Misery.\" Seven tracks have been added to Figure 8. The digital deluxe edition includes \"Figure 8\"\u2014Smith's cover of the \"Schoolhouse Rock!\" song\u2014which was originally released only on the Japanese edition of the album. The final track on the new Figure 8 edition is Smith's cover of the Beatles\u2019 \"Because\", originally featured on the 1999 American Beauty soundtrack. In May 2021, Smith's life and work were the subject of BBC Radio 4's Great Lives.\n\nDeath\nSmith died on October 21, 2003, at the age of 34 from two stab wounds to the chest. At the time of the stabbing, he was at his Lemoyne Street home in Echo Park, California, where he lived with his girlfriend, Jennifer Chiba. According to Chiba, the two were arguing, and she locked herself in the bathroom to take a shower. Chiba heard him scream and upon opening the door saw Smith standing with a knife in his chest. She pulled the knife out, after which he collapsed and she called 9-1-1 at 12:18 pm. Smith died in the hospital, with the time of death listed as 1:36 p.m. A possible suicide note, written on a sticky note, read: \"I'm so sorry\u2014love, Elliott. God forgive me.\" The coroner misspelled Smith's first name in the autopsy report, omitting the second 't'. While Smith's death was reported as a suicide, the official autopsy report released in December 2003 left open the question of homicide.\nSmith's remains were cremated, and his ashes were divided between his mother, father, and half-sister Ashley. A small memorial service for family and friends was held at his father's home in Portland, although Smith's \"ashes weren't on hand because the coroner wouldn't release them.\" The status or location of Smith's ashes has not been made public.\nAccording to Pitchfork, record producer Larry Crane reported on his Tape Op message board that he had planned to help Smith mix his album in mid-November. Crane wrote, \"I hadn't talked to Elliott in over a year. His girlfriend, Jennifer, called me [last week] and asked if I'd like to come to L.A. and help mix and finish [Smith's album]. I said 'yes, of course', and chatted with Elliott for the first time in ages. It seems surreal that he would call me to finish an album and then a week later kill himself. I talked to Jennifer this morning, who was obviously shattered and in tears, and she said, 'I don't understand, he was so healthy.'\" The coroner reported that no traces of illegal substances or alcohol were found in Smith's system at the time of his death but did find prescribed levels of antidepressant, anxiolytic, and ADHD medications, including clonazepam, mirtazapine, atomoxetine, and amphetamine. There were no hesitation wounds. Due to the inconclusive autopsy ruling, the Los Angeles Police Department's investigation remains open. \nNotably, Elliott received a letter from his step-father Charlie Welch on the day he died which he never had the chance to read. In it, Welch denies having urges to sexually abuse anyone after Elliott's allegations of repeated childhood sexual abuse from him but apologised for general mistreatment of him and his \u201cdeficiencies as a father.\u201d\n\nReaction\nShortly after Smith's death, a fan memorial was initiated outside Solutions Audio (4334 Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, California), the site at which the cover of the Figure 8 album was shot. Farewell messages to Smith were written on the wall, and flowers, photos, candles, and empty bottles of alcohol mentioned in Smith's songs were left. Since then, the wall has been a regular target for graffiti but is regularly restored by fans.\nMemorial concerts were held in several cities in the United States and the United Kingdom. A petition was soon put forth with intent to make part of the Silver Lake area a memorial park in Smith's honor. It received over 10,000 signatures, but no plans to establish the park have been announced. A memorial plaque located inside Smith's former high school, Lincoln High, was hung in July 2006. The plaque reads: \"I'm never going to know you now, but I'm going to love you anyhow\" referencing Smith's song \"Waltz No. 2 (XO)\".\n\nSince Smith's death, many musical acts have paid him tribute. Songs in tribute to, or about, Smith have been released by Pearl Jam (\"Can't Keep\" on the Live at Benaroya Hall concert album); Sparta (\"Bombs and Us\"); Third Eye Blind (\"There's No Hurry to Eternity\", originally titled \"Elliott Smith\", on the Live from Nowhere Near You, Volume Two: Pacific Northwest compilation); 9 Horses (\u201clistening to the Elliott Smith discography in reverse order\u201d, on the album Perfectest Herald); Ben Folds (\"Late\" on Songs for Silverman); Brad Mehldau (\"Sky Turning Grey (for Elliott Smith)\" on Highway Rider); Rilo Kiley (\"It Just Is\", and \"Ripchord\" from the album More Adventurous); Lil B's 'The Worlds Ending'; Rhett Miller (\"The Believer\" on The Believer); Earlimart (\"Heaven Adores You\" on Treble and Tremble); Joan As Police Woman (\"We Don't Own It\" on Real Life); Phoebe Bridgers (\"Punisher\" on Punisher); and Pete Yorn (\"Bandstand in the Sky\" on Nightcrawler, a song jointly dedicated to Jeff Buckley). Several tribute albums have been released since his death, including Christopher O'Riley's 2006 Home to Oblivion: An Elliott Smith Tribute, with 18 instrumental covers, The Portland Cello Project's 2014 to e.s., covering six of his songs, Seth Avett and Jessica Lea Mayfield's 2015 Seth Avett and Jessica Lea Mayfield Sing Elliott Smith, with 12 covers incorporating Smith's musical style and their own, and To Elliott, from Portland containing covers by a number of Portland bands. Singer Madonna covered his 1997 song \"Between the Bars\" in 2017.\nOn July 30, 2004, Chiba filed a lawsuit against the Smith family for 15% of his earnings (over $1 million), claiming that she and Smith lived as \"husband and wife\", that Smith had pledged to take care of her financially for the rest of her life, and that she worked as his manager and agent from around 2000 until his death. A state labor commissioner ruled her claim as manager to be invalid, as she had worked as an \"unlicensed talent agent\" under California's Talent Agencies Act. The case made it to the California appellate court in October 2007, but the decision was affirmed 2\u20131.\nIn an October 2013 Spin magazine article\u2014a reflection at the 10-year anniversary of Smith's death\u2014drummer McPherson stated that Smith was \"a sick man without his medicine\" during the last 31 days of his life, when he was not only sober, but had also given up red meat and sugar. In the same article, Chiba recalls thinking, \"Okay, you're asking a lot of yourself. You're giving up a lot at once.\" Chiba further explained that \"anyone who understands drug abuse knows that you use drugs to hide from your past or sedate yourself from strong, overwhelming feelings. So when you're newly clean and coming off the medications that have been masking all those feelings, that's when you're the most vulnerable.\" Writing for Spin, Liam Gowing also encountered a local musician who claimed Smith had said to him: \"The people who try to intervene, they're good people who genuinely care about you. But they don't know what you're going through. Do what you need to do.\" According to the musician, Smith had adamantly dissuaded him from suicide.\n\nMusical style and influences\nSmith respected and was inspired by many artists and styles, including the Beatles, Big Star, the Clash, the Who, Led Zeppelin, the Kinks, Pink Floyd, Rush, Bauhaus, Elvis Costello, Oasis, Television, Motown and flamenco records, AC\/DC, Hank Williams, and Scorpions, Smith claimed to listen exclusively to selected albums (such as The Marble Index by Nico) for months. Sean Croghan, a former roommate of Smith's, said that Smith \"listened almost exclusively to slow jams\" in his senior year at college. Smith also took inspiration from novels, religion, and philosophy. He liked classic literature, especially Samuel Beckett, T.S. Eliot, and Russian novelists such as Fyodor Dostoyevsky.\nSmith mentioned his admiration for Bob Dylan in several interviews, citing him as an early influence. He once commented: \"My father taught me how to play 'Don't Think Twice, It's All Right'. I love Dylan's words, but even more than that, I love the fact that he loves words.\" Smith covered Dylan's \"When I Paint My Masterpiece\" several times in concert. Smith has also been compared to folk singer Nick Drake, due to his fingerpicking style and vocals. Darryl Cater of AllMusic called references to \"the definitive folk loner\" Drake \"inevitable\", and Smith's lyrics have been compared to those in Drake's minimalist and haunting final album.\nSmith was a dedicated fan of the Beatles (as well as their solo projects), once noting that he had been listening to them frequently since he was about \"four years old\" and also claimed that hearing The White Album was his original inspiration to become a musician. In 1998, Smith contributed a cover of the Beatles song \"Because\" to the closing credits and soundtrack of the film American Beauty. Although this was the only Beatles song that Smith ever officially released, he is known to have recorded many others, (\"Revolution\", \"I'll Be Back\" and \"I'm So Tired\") and played many songs by both the band and the members' solo projects at live concerts.\nSmith said that his chord progressions were his favorite part of songs and that he preferred to write broader, more impressionistic music closer to pop rather than folk music. Smith compared his songs to stories or dreams, not purely confessional pieces that people could relate to. When asked about the dark nature of his songwriting and the cult following he was gaining, Smith said he felt it was merely a product of his writing songs that were strongly meaningful to him rather than anything contrived. Larry Crane, Smith's posthumous archivist, has said that he was surprised at the amount of \"recycling of musical ideas\" he encountered while cataloging Smith's private tapes: \"I found songs recorded in high school reworked 15 years on. Lyrics became more important to him as he became older, and more time was spent working on them.\"\n\nLegacy\nSince his death, Smith has been regarded as one of the most influential artists in indie music. Many artists have mentioned Smith as their influence, such as Frank Ocean, Beck, Phoebe Bridgers, Julien Baker, Adrianne Lenker, Alex G, Beabadoobee, and Haim's lead vocalist Danielle Haim.\n\nDiscography\nStudio albums\nRoman Candle (1994)\nElliott Smith (1995)\nEither\/Or (1997)\nXO (1998)\nFigure 8 (2000)\nFrom a Basement on the Hill (2004)\nCompilation albums\n\nNew Moon (2007)\n\nSee also\nList of unsolved deaths\n\nReferences\nBibliography\n\nNugent, Benjamin (2004).

Beyond this, the road becomes a private easement.\nAt its meeting of Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena the two roads become the zero-zero, east\u2013west, north\u2013south postal division of Pasadena which carries on into Altadena. In South Pasadena, the street numbering varies with its own postal zip code.\n\nHistory\nFair Oaks is one of the major roads developed by the Indiana Colony dating back to 1874. It was apparently named for one of Pasadena's earlier ranches, the Fair Oaks Ranch, named by the widow of General Albert Sidney Johnston for her Virginia home. The road led up from Raymond Hill and north to Washington Boulevard where it met the Painter Hotel. There being little reason to travel more northward, the road dwindled to a watery footpath and meandered through about three miles (5 km) of scrub growth until a similar road picked up in the Altadena Community. At that time, the road was the divider between the Indiana Colony and Benjamin D. Wilson's Lake Vineyard settlement.  As the original Indian Colony and the Vineyard colony became friendly economic rivals on each side of the avenue, it became known as the Mason and Dixon line.\nThe intersection of Fair Oaks Avenue and Colorado Boulevard became known as \"The Corners.\"  The avenue, along with Colorado Boulevard became the main streets in the early development of Pasadena with Fair Oaks Avenue being the main route between Los Angeles and Pasadena.\nIn 1895, the Pasadena and Los Angeles Railway built what became the Pacific Electric Railway's South Pasadena Local Red Car line on the entire length of Fair Oaks Avenue to Pasadena from its 6th & Main terminal in Downtown Los Angeles.  Also serving the avenue was the North Fair Oaks Avenue Line and the Mount Lowe Railway.  The lines were mostly abandoned in the 1920s.\nAt a point of today's 210 Freeway, there was a fork in the road that veered obliquely to the northwest. This was an access to the greatest local water source in Millard Canyon, and was named New Fair Oaks Road. Eventually this road was renamed Lincoln Avenue and Old Fair Oaks Road just became Fair Oaks Avenue.\nLong considered the center of town, the corner of Colorado and Fair Oaks lost its centrality by the ever eastwardly expansion of the city. But now it has regained its central position as one of the most attractive corners in the upscaled Old Town Pasadena sector.\n\nLandmarks and transportation\nAmongst many landmarks on Fair Oaks Avenue is the Fair Oaks Pharmacy which opened in 1915 and the historic modernest home 1414 Fair Oaks Building which is listed by the Los Angeles Conservancy.\nAlso on the avenue is the Los Angeles College of Music, the Huntington Hospital in Pasadena and the Mountain View Cemetery in Altadena.\nFair Oaks Avenue is served mainly by Metro Local line 260 south of Walnut Street, Line 660 between Del Mar Boulevard and Loma Alta Drive, Pasadena Transit Line 20 between Woodbury Road and Glenarm Street (except between Orange Grove and Del Mar boulevards) and Line 51\/52 between Mountain and Walnut streets.\n\nSee also\nList of streets in the San Gabriel Valley\n\n\n== References ==","77":"Fairfax Avenue is a street in the north central area of the city of Los Angeles, California, United States. It runs from La Cienega Boulevard in Culver City at its southern end to Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood on its northern end. From La Cienega Boulevard (between Culver City and Mid-City) to Sunset Boulevard between West Hollywood and Hollywood, Fairfax Avenue separates the Westside from the central part of the city along with Venice Boulevard, La Cienega Boulevard, Hauser Boulevard, San Vicente Boulevard, South Cochran Avenue, Wilshire Boulevard, 6th Street, Cochran Avenue, 4th Street, La Brea Avenue, Fountain Avenue and Sunset Boulevard.\nFairfax Avenue forms the western boundary of Hancock Park as well as Park La Brea, a 160-acre (60 ha), 4,222-unit apartment complex with over 10,000 residents.\nSince World War II, the Fairfax District has been a heavily Jewish neighborhood in Mid-City West. Fairfax High School, on the corner of Fairfax and Melrose Avenue, was known as the alma mater of many entertainment industry personalities. Canter's Deli has been a late night hangout in Los Angeles since the 1940s. CBS's Television City is located on the corner of Fairfax and Beverly Boulevard, where thousands camp out to wait for a chance to watch The Price Is Right, and the former site of Gilmore Stadium, where the minor league baseball team, the Hollywood Stars, used to play prior to the Dodgers moving from Brooklyn. World-famous recording studio, Cherokee Studios, home to over 250 gold and platinum records, is just above Melrose Avenue.\nThe Grove is off 3rd Street and Fairfax.

She gained media attention in 1995 when the English actor Hugh Grant was caught receiving oral sex from her in his car on Hollywood's Sunset Boulevard. Thompson has remained in the public eye through work in pornography, television appearances, and newspaper interviews.\n\nEarly life\nThompson grew up in poverty in East Oakland, California. She was one of six children of a single mother. Having herself become a mother of two daughters, she turned to sex work when she could not pay a $133 electricity bill. Going to Union Square in San Francisco one night, she earned $1,000 in five hours.\n\nLegal troubles\nArrest with Hugh Grant\nOn June 27, 1995, Thompson and British actor Hugh Grant were arrested together in Los Angeles. According to Thompson, the attention of a policeman was alerted by Grant repeatedly pressing the brake pedal of his BMW with his foot, causing the brake lights to flash many times.\nCharged with lewd conduct, she pleaded no contest on September 6, 1995. She was ordered to attend an AIDS class and perform five days of community service, and sentenced to two years' summary probation. She was also sentenced to 180 days in jail for unconnected parole violations relating to two prostitution convictions. She had to pay a fine and costs of $1,350 in total in relation to the offences. Hugh Grant pleaded no contest and was fined $1,180 and ordered to complete an AIDS education program.\n\nOther legal troubles\nIn September 1996, Thompson was arrested at the MGM Grand Las Vegas in Paradise after flirting and making suggestive comments to undercover police officers. A police officer involved in the operation was quoted as saying, \"She didn't actually solicit, but the police officers knew what she was up to.\" The arrest resulted in a $950 fine for loitering for the purpose of prostitution and resisting arrest. Thompson denied she was still involved in sex work.\n\nMedia appearances\nThompson only learned who her client had been when reporters besieged her house the day after her arrest. In the publicity that ensued in the days after her encounter with Grant, Thompson appeared on television shows, including The Howard Stern Show and Danny Bonaduce's short-lived Danny!. She appeared in a television commercial promoting a Los Angeles radio station, a commercial for a Brazilian lingerie company, in semi-nude pictures for soft-porn magazines like Penthouse, and as a presenter on UK pornography channel Television X. In 1996, she played herself in an X-rated docu-drama based on the incident, Sunset and Divine: The British Experience. In September 1996, she made an appearance at the professional wrestling show Fight the Power.\nThompson continued to stay in the public eye, appearing in Joey Buttafuoco's public-access television show in 1998, on Judge Judy in 1996, and on the Danish documentary series Negermagasinet in 2005. She was the subject of the biopic Million Dollar Hooker in 2006 and appeared on Hollywood Lives, an ITV television series, in 2007.\n\nPersonal life\nThompson has been reported to have earned a total of $1.6 million from publicity related to her arrest with Grant. As a result, she and her manager, partner, and father of her children, Alvin C. Brown, bought a four-bedroom home in Beverly Hills. Thompson has said the money she earned from interviews and endorsements after the 1995 interrupted dalliance has allowed her to put her daughters through private school. \"Everything worked out for the better,\" she said in 2007: \"It helped me turn it into something positive \u2026 I was blessed that it could get me out of that lifestyle.\"\nGrant, asked in a 2003 London Times interview about how he viewed his encounter with Thompson, said, \"I think, ultimately, the pros and cons about evened out, actually. I remember saying to my agent the night of the event \u2013 I was very drunk \u2013 'Is this bad for my career?' He was a very Hollywood guy, for whom everything is fantastic, and even he ... had to say: 'Oh, it's not great.' But on the other hand, there were odd things coming out of it that were quite positive, in a way. So I have to say, in all honesty, I think it was kind of neutral.\"\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nEmily Dugan The $50 Trick (or how Divine Brown turned an encounter with Hugh Grant into her fortune) The Independent, July 3, 2007\nDivine Brown biography Rotten.com\nDivine Brown at IMDb\n\"Sunset and Divine: The British Experience (1996)\" IMDb.com","79":"Figueroa Street is a major north-south street in Los Angeles County, California, spanning from the Los Angeles neighborhood of Wilmington north to Eagle Rock. A short, unconnected continuation of Figueroa Street runs just south of Marengo Drive in Glendale to Chevy Chase Drive in La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge.\n\nRoute description\nOne of the longer streets in the city, it runs in a north\/south direction for more than 30 miles (48 km) from its southern terminus at Harry Bridges Boulevard in the Wilmington neighborhood to Chevy Chase Drive in the city of La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge at the north end.\nFrom its south end at Harry Bridges Boulevard to Downtown Los Angeles, Figueroa Street runs north parallel to the Harbor Freeway (Interstate 110) in South Los Angeles. The only portion of this segment of Figueroa Street that lies outside Los Angeles city limits is in the city of Carson. South of the Los Angeles Financial District, Figueroa Street passes well-known locations including the University of Southern California, the Los Angeles Convention Center, and Crypto.com Arena\/L.A. Live. \nBetween Olympic Boulevard and 3rd Street in downtown Los Angeles, Figueroa Street forms a one-way pair with Flower Street, with northbound traffic staying on Figueroa and southbound traffic diverting to Flower.\nAfter passing through downtown near Bunker Hill and South Park, the southern portion of Figueroa Street ends near the overcrossing of Sunset Boulevard over the Arroyo Seco Parkway (SR 110) in Chinatown. The northern portion of the street resumes at San Fernando Road in Cypress Park. An early routing of Figueroa Street in this area was originally part of U.S. Route 66, today a part of the Arroyo Seco Parkway (State Route 110). The noted Figueroa Street Tunnels were once a part of that same stretch of roadway.\n\nAfter resuming at San Fernando Road, Figueroa continues to run roughly parallel to the Arroyo Seco Parkway until it reaches York Boulevard in Highland Park. Afterwards, it heads north to its terminus near the Scholl Canyon Landfill just past its junction with the Ventura Freeway (State Route 134) in Eagle Rock. A short, unconnected continuation of Figueroa Street runs from a residential area just south of Marengo Drive in Glendale to end at Chevy Chase Drive just over the city limit line in La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge.\nEarly maps produced by the Automobile Club of Southern California measured distances to Los Angeles from the club's headquarters at the intersection of Figueroa Street with Adams Boulevard.\n\nHistory\nThe street is named for General Jos\u00e9 Figueroa (1792 \u2013 September 29, 1835), the Mexican governor of Alta California from 1833 to 1835, who oversaw the secularization of the Spanish missions in California.\nFigueroa Street was originally called Calle de los Chapules, which translates to \"Street of the Grasshoppers\". Chapules is the plural of \"chapul\", which is not the standard Spanish word for grasshopper (that being \"saltamonte\"), but rather a word from the Nahuatl of Durango and Nayarit (also known as Mexicanero). \nLater in the 1880s it became known as \"Pearl Street\". Figueroa Street originally was a few blocks west of Pearl but joined Pearl Street further south.  Pearl Street was changed to Figueroa and the northern portion of the old Figueroa Street was renamed Boylston. The section of what is now Figueroa in Highland Park above Avenue 39 was known as \"Pasadena Avenue\" until Figueroa was extended through Elysian Park. The portion of what is now Figueroa between the Los Angeles River and Avenue 39 was originally known as Dayton Avenue until the Arroyo Parkway went through.\nPrior to construction of the Harbor Freeway, Figueroa St. carried U.S. Route 6 to Pacific Coast Highway south from the Four-Level Interchange.\nUntil 1977, the Guinness Book of Records deemed Figueroa to be the longest street in the world. At the request of writer Jay Myers, it was supplanted by Yonge Street in Toronto.\nOn April 2, 2011, a portion of Figueroa Street at Jefferson Boulevard was blocked off for the \"Orange Carpet\" and the grandstand for the broadcasting of the 2011 Kids' Choice Awards.\nIn South Los Angeles, Figueroa Street has the highest number of prostitution-related arrests in Los Angeles.\nThe Los Angeles Lakers, the Los Angeles Kings and Los Angeles Rams have used Figueroa as the parade route for their respective championships in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2009 and 2010 for the Lakers, 2012 and 2014 for the Kings and in 2022 for the Rams.\n\nFuture\nKobe Bryant Boulevard\nOn \"Mamba Day\", August 24, 2020, then-Los Angeles City Council President Herb Wesson and then council member Curren Price announced plans to rename the 3-mile (4.8 km) segment of Figueroa Street between Olympic Boulevard and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard as Kobe Bryant Boulevard. It would be renamed in honor of professional basketball player Kobe Bryant, who along with his daughter Gianna and seven others were killed in a helicopter crash on January 26, 2020. The segment of Figueroa between Olympic and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard passes by the Crypto.com Arena, the home to the Los Angeles Lakers who Bryant played with throughout his entire 20-year career and is dubbed the \"House that Kobe built\". In October 21, 2020, the vote to consider the proposal was delayed by the council, and a new date has yet to be stated as of June 2021.\n\n\"My Figueroa\" development plan and 2028 Summer Olympics\nThe Figueroa Corridor Streetscape project is a city led effort to beautify and improve the boulevard by adding pedestrian friendly amenities. The beautification project began on 7th street in Downtown Los Angeles, by Crypto.com Arena and terminates at Exposition Park at USC. The project began in 2017 and was completed by the end of 2018. It aimed to improve transit and pedestrian access, protected bike lanes totally protected by physical barriers, a more organized and efficient street by adding better signalization and signage, high-visibility crosswalks, transit platforms, more street trees, public art and wider sidewalks. The $20 million Figueroa Corridor Streetscape project was funded by a Proposition 1C grant. After delays, work was expected to commence in the summer of 2016 and was expected to be completed by March 2017, when the prop 1C grant expired. The Los Angeles 2028 organizing committee plan to use this corridor as a planned \"Live Site\", an area dedicated as a central pedestrian corridor, linking all of the Downtown LA venues together during the 2028 Olympic & Paralympic Games.\n\nMajor intersections\nThe entire street is in Los Angeles County.\n\nTransportation\nThe Metro C and J lines operate a station underneath Interstate 105 at Figueroa Street. Metro Local Line 81 operates on Figueroa Street between Colorado Boulevard and Interstate 105 and Torrance Transit Line 1 between Interstate 105 and the Harbor Gateway Transit Center. The Metro E Line has 5 stations nearby. Two of which are shared with the Metro A Line, one being a major hub connecting to the Metro B and D lines. The Metro J Line runs on Figueroa Street in Gardena and between 23rd and 6th Streets in Downtown: Northbound J line trips to El Monte Bus Station continue north on Figueroa Street to serve the 7th Street \/ Metro Center and finally turn right on 6th street, leaving Figueroa Street. Southbound J Line trips to Harbor Gateway Transit Center or San Pedro run south on Flower Street from 5th Street to the Harbor Transitway. There are 6 J Line street stops located on Figueroa Street: Figueroa\/190th\/Victoria; Northbound only: Figueroa\/23rd, Figueroa\/Washington, Figueroa\/Pico, Figueroa\/Olympic, and Figueroa\/7th . In addition, there are 7 Metro J Line Stations served on the Harbor Transitway and Harbor Freeway close to Figueroa Street: 37th Street\/USC, Slauson, Manchester, Harbor Freeway (with C Line connection), Rosecrans, Carson, and Pacific Coast Hwy. The Harbor Transitway is located on the I-110 freeway, between Figueroa Street and Broadway. There are also three other Metro A Line stations near Figueroa Street: Lincoln\/Cypress (at Avenue 26), Southwest Museum, and Highland Park (at Avenue 57).\n\nNotable landmarks\nEducation\nLuther Burbank Middle School\nFlorence Nightingale Middle School\nOptimist High School\nSycamore Grove School\nUniversity of Southern California\n\nBuildings on Figueroa\nAppearances in popular culture\nThe Figueroa corridor was featured by Huell Howser in Road Trip, episode 103.\n\nReferences\n\n\n== External links ==","80":"Florence Avenue is a major east\u2013west street in central Los Angeles County and South Los Angeles, in Southern California.\n\nRoute\nIt is bounded in the east by Mills Avenue at Janine Drive in Whittier, past Whittier Boulevard. At Telegraph Road, it changes to Florence. West of La Cienega Boulevard, it swerves into Aviation Boulevard, which is a north\u2013south street, in the City of Inglewood.\nFlorence Avenue runs through the cities of Inglewood, Los Angeles, Huntington Park (where it intersects Pacific Boulevard), Bell, Bell Gardens, Downey, Santa Fe Springs, and unincorporated Los Angeles County bordering the City of Whittier.\nFlorence Avenue also crosses the San Diego Freeway (Interstate 405), Harbor Freeway (Interstate 110), Long Beach Freeway (Interstate 710), San Gabriel River Freeway (Interstate 605), and Santa Ana Freeway (Interstate 5).\nAn unconnected portion of Florence Avenue is located in La Habra and has similar west\u2013east coordinates to the main Florence Avenue.\n\nPublic transit\nMetro Local Lines 111 and 120 run through Florence Avenue; the former runs through most of Florence starting at Studebaker Road and the latter east of Studebaker Road.\n\nRapid transit\nThe Metro A Line light rail serves the Florence station, at the intersection of Graham Avenue and Florence Avenue in the unincorporated community of Florence.\nThe Metro K Line serves three light rail stations on Florence Avenue, with the Fairview Heights station in Inglewood at West Boulevard near the border adjacent to the Hyde Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, the Downtown Inglewood station at La Brea Avenue in Downtown Inglewood and the Westchester\/Veterans station at Hindry Avenue near the border adjacent to the Westchester neighborhood of Los Angeles.\n\nHistory\nThe roadway was formerly known as Redondo Boulevard westward from West Boulevard at the Inglewood-Los Angeles city boundary.\nLand developer George E. Longan in 1927 established a new business center on Redondo Boulevard near Hillcrest Avenue, Inglewood, a Spanish stucco structure \"in harmony with the nearby Inglewood Woman's Club.\"\nIn 1931 West Boulevard was extended south to Florence Avenue and intersected Redondo Boulevard at the latter's easterly end.\nIn 1934, the Los Angeles Times noted that \"Florence Avenue runs into Redondo Boulevard.\" East\u2013west Redondo Boulevard turned north\u2013south to traverse between Inglewood and Redondo Beach.\n\n\n== References ==","81":"Foothill Boulevard is a major road in the city and county of Los Angeles, as well as an arterial road in the city and county of San Bernardino, stretching well over 60 miles (97 km) in length, with some notable breaks along the route.  Like its name implies, Foothill Boulevard runs across the foothills of the San Gabriel and San Bernardino Mountains.\nFor much of its length, Foothill Boulevard is the historic Route 66, so many diners and other establishments along the road have been refurbished in a 1950s style, or otherwise trade on the Route 66 association.\n\nRoute description\nFoothill Boulevard starts off in Newhall Pass in the Sylmar district of Los Angeles at Sierra Highway near the southern terminus of the Antelope Valley Freeway (SR 14). Foothill Boulevard is a two-lane road through Newhall Pass, paralleling the Interstate 5 truck lanes until its intersection with Balboa Boulevard, where it becomes a four-lane road for the remainder of its length. At the I-5\/I-210 interchange, Foothill Boulevard heads southeast along the Foothill Freeway, bypassing the city of San Fernando, entering Lake View Terrace south of the I-210\/SR 118 interchange. SR 118 formerly ran along Foothill Boulevard from the 210\/118 interchange until Pasadena.  In 1974, the current alignment of Interstate 210 was completed, and the only remaining portion of the Foothill Boulevard Freeway was the unsigned freeway over the Arroyo Seco in Pasadena.\nFoothill Boulevard leaves the San Fernando Valley, passing through the Sunland and Tujunga neighborhoods in the northwestern Crescenta Valley. It then enters the Crescenta Highlands neighborhood of Glendale and serves as a main street in the north Glendale area. Then it enters the unincorporated area of La Crescenta-Montrose (known just as \"La Crescenta\" to locals), and it serves as the main street through the valley.  Upon crossing the Verdugo Wash, it enters the city of La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge and the northern terminus of the Glendale Freeway. Further east is the southern terminus of the Angeles Crest Highway (SR 2).  Note that although the Glendale Freeway and Angeles Crest Highway both end at Foothill Boulevard, Foothill itself does not intersect State Route 2, as SR 2's alignment heads east one mile (1.6 km) on Interstate 210.  This portion of Foothill Boulevard is operated by Glendale Transit line 3 and Metro Local lines 90 and 690. The western segment of Foothill Boulevard ends at Oak Grove Drive in Pasadena, where it heads southeast across the unsigned freeway alignment, with an interchange at Yucca Lane. To reach the second portion of Foothill Boulevard, one must head east on Oak Grove, where it becomes Woodbury Road, head south on Fair Oaks Avenue, and head east on Walnut Street, passing through Old Town Pasadena, where at Greenwood Avenue, Foothill Boulevard branches off.\n\nUntil the 1960s, there was another segment of Foothill Boulevard that extended north into Altadena along the current route of Altadena Drive. This spur began at the current intersection of Foothill Boulevard and Altadena Drive in the eastern part of Pasadena\u2014at that time, Foothill was named East Foothill Boulevard; Altadena Drive north of Foothill was signed North Foothill Boulevard, while Altadena Drive south of Foothill was signed Santa Anita Avenue.  North Foothill Boulevard ran north along the eastern part of Pasadena into the eastern extremity of Altadena, paralleling Eaton Canyon for about 1\u20442 mile (0.80 km).  At Mendocino Lane in Altadena, the route became East Foothill Boulevard again and ran east\u2013west through the central part of Altadena. At the intersection with Fair Oaks Avenue in west Altadena, the road became West Foothill Boulevard and came to a dead end about 1\u20444 mile (0.40 km) west of Lincoln Avenue, a good mile away from the end of the western segment of Foothill in La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge. It is not clear if the two segments were ever supposed to be connected, as the Arroyo Seco and Jet Propulsion Laboratory intervene; however, the changes in direction and duplicate street names were confusing\u2014not only did North Foothill meet East Foothill, there were two East Foothill Boulevards (one in Pasadena and one in Altadena) and two Santa Anita Avenues (again, one in Pasadena and one in Altadena.) The city of Pasadena and the County of Los Angeles both agreed to change the name of the spur north of Foothill to Altadena Drive; Santa Anita Avenue between Foothill and the southern city limit of Pasadena was also renamed Altadena Drive, though that name change did not occur until the early 1970s.\n\n   Foothill Boulevard remains parallel to Interstate 210 until entering the Arcadia city limits, where it heads due east and the freeway heads southeast. This section of Foothill Boulevard, which ends at Mountain Avenue in Monrovia, was also a part of US 66 until the late 1930s.  Before Huntington Drive was built through Duarte, Foothill Boulevard ran along the current routing of Royal Oaks Drive between Shamrock Avenue in Monrovia just past Highland Avenue in Duarte, meeting the current end of Foothill Boulevard at the San Gabriel River bridge. Most of the old route in eastern Duarte was removed during the housing boom in the 1940s.\nThe third section of Foothill Boulevard is accessed by going south on Mountain and going east on Huntington Drive through the Los Angeles County cities of Monrovia and Duarte.  Upon crossing the San Gabriel River into Irwindale, Huntington turns into Foothill Boulevard. Foothill passes through the city of Azusa, where it jogs north at Citrus Avenue. It continues through Glendora one block north of the old U.S. Route 66 to Amelia Avenue. In Azusa, east of Cerritos Avenue, Alosta Avenue (the old U.S. Route 66) forks southeast (the city of Glendora renamed Alosta Avenue \"Route 66\"), and at Amelia Avenue, it turns back into Foothill Boulevard. At the interchange with SR 210 near the San Dimas\/La Verne city limits, Foothill Boulevard is defined as State Route 66, although it is unsigned in Los Angeles County.\n\nFoothill Blvd (SR 66) passes through the north end of Pomona and Claremont before entering San Bernardino County in the city of Upland. Foothill passes through residential areas before emerging in Rancho Cucamonga, where it intersects Interstate 15.  Foothill Boulevard continues east through the cities of Fontana (and such landmarks as Bono's Restaurant and Deli), Rialto, and San Bernardino. Foothill Boulevard ends at the San Bernardino city limits, where it retains its SR 66 signage, but changes into 5th Street and the route passes through downtown San Bernardino. At the interchange with Interstate 215, the SR 66 designation ends (at downtown San Bernardino), although old US 66 headed north on Mount Vernon Avenue (along old US 395\/US 91) before exiting the Inland Empire over the Cajon Pass. Fifth Street has an interchange with SR 210 in Highland before turning into Greenspot Road, where it ends in the San Bernardino Mountains.\n\nThere are US 66 signs within the cities of Rancho Cucamonga, Rialto, and San Bernardino.  Many other cities along the boulevard have posted \"Historic Route 66\" signage.\nCalifornia's legislature has relinquished state control of the segment from the Pomona\u2013Claremont line east to the Fontana\u2013Rialto line, and turned it over to local control.\nSR 66 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, although it is neither a freeway nor an expressway. SR 66 is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration.\n\nSee also\nFoothill Boulevard Milestone (Mile 11)\nInterstate 210\nU.S. Route 66\nList of streets in the San Gabriel Valley\n\nReferences\n\n\n== External links ==","82":"\"For What It's Worth (Stop, Hey What's That Sound)\" (often referred to as simply \"For What It's Worth\") is a song written by Stephen Stills. Performed by Buffalo Springfield, it was recorded on December 5, 1966, released as a single on Atco Records in December 1966 and peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the spring of 1967.\nIt was later added to the March 1967 second pressing of their first album, Buffalo Springfield. The title was added after the song was written, and does not appear in the lyrics.\nIn 2004 Rolling Stone magazine ranked the song at number 63 on its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\nBackground\nAlthough \"For What It's Worth\" is often considered an anti-war song, Stephen Stills was inspired to write the song because of the Sunset Strip curfew riots in Los Angeles in November 1966, a series of early counterculture-era clashes that took place between police and young people on the Sunset Strip in Hollywood, California, the same year Buffalo Springfield had become the house band at the Whisky a Go Go. Local residents and businesses had become annoyed by how crowds of young people going to clubs and music venues along the Strip had caused late-night traffic congestion. In response, they lobbied Los Angeles County to pass local ordinances stopping loitering, and enforced a strict curfew on the Strip after 10 p.m. The young music fans, however, felt the new laws infringed upon their civil rights.\nOn Saturday, November 12, 1966, fliers were distributed on the Sunset Strip inviting people to join demonstrations later that day. Several of Los Angeles's rock radio stations also announced a rally outside the Pandora's Box club on the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Crescent Heights. That evening, as many as 1,000 young demonstrators, including future celebrities such as Jack Nicholson and Peter Fonda (who was handcuffed by police) gathered to protest against the curfew's enforcement. Although the rallies began peacefully, trouble eventually broke out. The unrest continued the next night, and periodically throughout the rest of November and December, forcing some clubs to shut down within weeks. It was against the background of these civil disturbances that Stills recorded \"For What It's Worth\" on December 5, 1966.\n\nProduction\nStills said in an interview that the name of the song came about when he presented it to the record company executive Ahmet Ertegun (who signed Buffalo Springfield to the Atlantic Records-owned ATCO label). Stills said \"I have this song here, for what it's worth, if you want it.\"  Another producer, Charlie Greene, claims that Stills first said the above line to him, but credits Ahmet Ertegun with giving the single the parenthetical subtitle \"Stop, Hey What's That Sound\" so that the song would be more easily recognized.\nThe song was recorded on December 5, 1966, at Columbia Studios, Hollywood. Tom Dowd claimed he mixed the song at Atlantic's studio in New York, though this has been disputed. Dowd did take part in the production of Cher's version of the song in 1969. One of the most recognizable elements of the song is Neil Young's use of guitar harmonics.\n\nReleases and charts\nWhile memories of the November riots were still fresh, the group and Ertegun pushed for a rush-release of \"For What It's Worth\".  On December 10, 1966, five days after the song was recorded, local Top 40 radio station KHJ began playing the single. It first appeared on the station's \"Boss 30\" chart on December 28, 1966, at number 26, and was followed by rival KRLA on January 14, 1967, where the single entered its \"Top 40 Requests\" at number eight. Also on January 14, Billboard magazine identified it as a \"regional breakout\" and the single appeared on its Bubbling Under the Hot 100 chart.  Two weeks later, it debuted at number 90 on the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at number seven on March 25 and remained on the chart for a total of fifteen weeks. Although the single did not reach the charts in the U.K., the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) certified a 2004 release by Warner Music as platinum (sales and streams of 600,000) in 2023.\n\nTo capitalize on the single's success, Atco was pushing for a follow-up album that featured the song.  It began printing album jackets with the title Stampede, but the group did not have enough songs for a new LP.  Instead, Atco reissued their debut album and added Stills's song as the opening track. It eventually reached number 80 on Billboard's Top LPs chart. As one of Buffalo Springfield's best-known songs, it is included on several of the group's anthologies, such as Retrospective: The Best of Buffalo Springfield (1969), the Buffalo Springfield box set (2001), and What's That Sound? Complete Albums Collection (2018).\n\nCertifications\nCritical commentary and legacy\nCash Box said the single is a \"throbbing, infectious protester circling 'round the current happenings in Cal.\"\n\"For What It's Worth\" quickly became a well-known protest song. However, contrary to popular belief, the song was not motivated by the Vietnam War, but rather a confrontation Stills had in Los Angeles' Sunset Strip neighborhood. In 2006, when interviewed on Tom Kent's radio show Into the '70s, Stills pointed out that many people think the song is about the Kent State shootings of 1970, even though its release predates that event by over three years. Neil Young\u2014Stills's bandmate in both Buffalo Springfield and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young (CSNY)\u2014would later write \"Ohio\" in response to the events at Kent State.\nAn all-star version of \"For What It's Worth\", with Tom Petty and others, was played at Buffalo Springfield's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997; Neil Young did not attend the event.\nThe song is a staple of period piece films about 1960s America and the Vietnam War, such as Forrest Gump, and often used as a common shorthand to quickly establish the atmosphere of 1960s counterculture movement and protests.\nThe song appears in the intro to the 2005 film Lord of War, showing the lifecycle of a rifle cartridge, from manufacture to firing.\nOn August 17, 2020, Billy Porter sang \"For What It's Worth\" for the 2020 Democratic National Convention backed by Stephen Stills on guitar, a nod to the song's resurgent use in the summer 2020 American protests.\nIn 2000, the 1966 recording of \"For What It's Worth\" by Buffalo Springfield on ATCO Records was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. The HOF lists the ATCO date as 1967.\n\nCovers and sampling\n\"For What It's Worth\" has been covered, sampled, and referenced in numerous musical performances. Versions include those by the Staple Singers (US #66 in 1967)(CAN #46 in 1967), Art (1967 single from Supernatural Fairy Tales), King Curtis (in the 1967 album King Sized Soul), Ken Lyon & Tombstone, Rush, Cher, the Candyskins, Oui 3 (UK #28), Queensr\u00ffche (on their album Take Cover), Miriam Makeba (on her album Keep Me in Mind), Ozzy Osbourne and (h\u0259d) p.e. (retitled Children). Cher's 1969 cover did not make the Billboard Hot 100 but it did reach #88 in Canada. AllMusic retrospectively called her version \"mature [and] forceful\".\nSergio Mendes and Brasil'66 recorded a version of this song. It reached #10 in the Adult Contemporary Music Chart on September 19, 1970. Singer Karen Philipp suggested to Sergio that he should cover the song. Karen does all of the vocals for this song by overdubbing. Two versions of this song exist: The mono 45 has a more extreme overdubbing of Karen's vocals with a different organ solo than the LP. The LP version is in stereo with a different vocal arrangement.\nDavid Cassidy recorded an extended live version for his 1974 album Cassidy Live! (Bell Records, UK #9; recorded live in Great Britain in May 1974).\nOn episode 2.21 of The Muppet Show, originally airing 19 February 1978, \"For What It's Worth\" is performed by an opossum (Jerry Nelson) and a chorus of woodland animals. The third verse is rewritten by an uncredited writer to give the song an anti-hunting theme.\nThe hip-hop group Public Enemy sampled \"For What It's Worth\" on their 1998 song \"He Got Game\", which featured Stephen Stills reprising his vocal performance from the original song. Oui 3 adapted the song for their 1993 debut single of the same name, which reached number 26 in the UK chart.\nIn 2017, Haley Reinhart released a cover of the song as the third single from her third studio album, What's That Sound? In 2018, the Lone Bellow released a cover of the song as a single. In 2022 Stevie Nicks released a cover of it as well, not to be confused with her 2011 song of the same name.\n\nSee also\nList of 1960s one-hit wonders in the United States\nProtest songs in the United States\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\nReasontorock analysis of song\nBuffalo Springfield: For What It's Worth on YouTube\nThe Staple Singers: For What It's Worth on YouTube","83":"Franklin Avenue is a street in Los Angeles.

The entire route connects San Pedro and the Port of Los Angeles with Downtown Los Angeles and Pasadena. The southern segment from San Pedro to I-10 in downtown Los Angeles is signed as I-110, while the northern segment to Pasadena is signed as SR 110. The entire length of I-110, as well as SR 110 south of the Four Level Interchange with US Route 101 (US 101), is the Harbor Freeway, and SR 110 north from US 101 to Pasadena is the historic Arroyo Seco Parkway, the first freeway in the western United States.\n\nRoute description\nRoute 110 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration.\n\nHarbor Freeway\nThe Harbor Freeway, signed as I-110, begins at Gaffey Street in San Pedro, where it then travels mostly due north to the Santa Monica Freeway (I-10) at a point south of downtown Los Angeles, where it becomes signed as SR 110. I-110 is primarily within the city limits of Los Angeles, running right along the South Los Angeles region and the Harbor Gateway, a two-mile (3.2 km) wide north\u2013south corridor that was annexed by the city of Los Angeles specifically to connect San Pedro, Wilmington, and the Port of Los Angeles with the rest the city.\nNorth of I-10, the freeway continues as SR 110 through Downtown Los Angeles to its junction with US 101 at the Four Level Interchange.\nThe Harbor Freeway, along with the Long Beach Freeway (I-710), are the principal means for freight from the Port of Los Angeles to railyards and warehouses further inland. Its interchange with the Santa Monica Freeway is notoriously busy and congested, and the portions bordering Bunker Hill in northwest Downtown Los Angeles are choked with traffic at peak travel times.\n\nLandmarks\nNotable landmarks and attractions near the Harbor Freeway include the Los Angeles Harbor College,  California State University, Dominguez Hills, Watts Towers, Exposition Park (including the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the BMO Stadium and the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art), the University of Southern California, Crypto.com Arena, L.A. Live, Los Angeles Convention Center, the skyline of Downtown Los Angeles; and Chinatown.\nThe Harbor Freeway is noted for its elaborate high-occupancy toll lane feature, with the HOT lanes elevated above the rest of traffic in many areas, constructed in 1994 by C.C. Myers, Inc. as HOV lanes and converted to HOT lanes in 2012. Of particular note is the Judge Harry Pregerson Interchange, which contains the most elaborate network of direct HOV\/HOT connectors in Los Angeles County. It includes a seven-story ramp that connects the Century Freeway's HOV lanes to the Harbor Freeway's northbound HOT lanes and offers splendid views of the entire Los Angeles Basin and the San Gabriel Mountains. The interchange with SR 91 (formally known as the Edmond J. Russ Interchange) is also fairly large.\n\nArroyo Seco Parkway\nSR 110 continues north as the Arroyo Seco Parkway from US 101 to Pasadena. From downtown, it passes through Elysian Park, where the northbound lanes pass through the four Figueroa Street Tunnels and the higher southbound lanes pass through a cut and over low areas on bridges. Then after crossing the Los Angeles River and the Golden State Freeway (I-5), the parkway runs alongside the Arroyo Seco seasonal river towards Pasadena.\n\nHarbor Transitway\nThe Harbor Transitway is a grade-separated, shared-use express bus and high-occupancy toll (HOT) corridor, running in the median of I-110, between SR 91 (Gardena Freeway) and Adams Boulevard in the south side of Downtown Los Angeles. Southbound buses exit the HOT lanes at dedicated ramps connecting to the Harbor Gateway Transit Center. Each vehicle using the HOT lanes is required to carry a FasTrak Flex transponder, with its switch set to indicate the number of the vehicle's occupants (1, 2, or 3 or more), regardless of whether they qualify for free.\n\nHistory\nIn the 1924 Major Street Traffic Plan for Los Angeles, a widening of Figueroa Street to San Pedro as a good road to the Port of Los Angeles was proposed. Progress was slow, and, in 1933, the state legislature added the entire length to the state highway system as Route 165, an unsigned designation. This route not only extended from San Pedro north to Los Angeles, but continued through the city-built Figueroa Street Tunnels and along the northern extension of Figueroa Street to Eagle Rock, and then followed Linda Vista Avenue (via an overlap on Route 161 (SR 134) over the Colorado Street Bridge) to Route 9 (now I-210) at the Devil's Gate Reservoir. The entire length of Route 165 became Sign Route 11 in 1934. US Route 6 was also assigned to the portion between SR 1 and Avenue 26 in 1937, and, at about the same time, US 66 was moved from Eagle Rock Boulevard to Figueroa Street, overlapping SR 11 between Sunset Boulevard (US 101) and Colorado Street (SR 134).\nThe state completed the Arroyo Seco Parkway which had been added to the state highway system in 1935 as Route 205, in early 1941, providing a faster route between SR 11 at Avenue 26 and Pasadena. US 66 was moved to the new route, while SR 11 remained on Figueroa Street and Linda Vista Avenue, the former also becoming a new US Route 66 Alternate. Construction of a freeway to San Pedro was much slower, despite having been in the earliest plans for an integrated system. Initially, the Harbor Parkway was to split at the merge with the Venice Parkway northeast of the University of Southern California, with the East By-Pass and West By-Pass straddling the Los Angeles Central Business District and rejoining at the split between the Arroyo Seco Parkway and Riverside Parkway south of Dodger Stadium. The West By-Pass was soon incorporated into the Harbor Parkway, and the first short piece, by then renamed the Harbor Freeway, opened on July 30, 1952, from the Four Level Interchange south to 3rd Street. (The Arroyo Seco Parkway was completed to the Four Level Interchange on September 22, 1953, and renamed the Pasadena Freeway on November 16, 1954.)\nThe Harbor Freeway gradually pushed south, opening to Olympic Boulevard on March 23, 1954, and Washington Boulevard on May 14, 1954. On March 27, 1956, the highway was extended to 42nd Street, and on April 24, 1957, it reached temporary ramps at 88th Place. Further extensions were made to Century Boulevard on July 31, 1958, 124th Street on September 24, 1958, Alondra Boulevard (which the county widened to carry the load) on May 2, 1960, 190th Street on July 15, 1960, Torrance Boulevard on August 28, 1962, and finally Pacific Coast Highway (SR 1) on September 26, 1962. There it connected with a section that had been open since June 19, 1956, from Pacific Coast Highway south to Channel Street. Along with the Vincent Thomas Bridge to Terminal Island, the final piece in San Pedro opened on July 9, 1970, completing the Harbor Freeway to its present length.\nIn December 1978, the Harbor Freeway was approved as an Interstate Highway by the FHWA. In 1981, the SR 11 designation was renumbered as I-110 on the Harbor Freeway, and SR 110 on the Pasadena Freeway. The I-110 designation had been previously applied to what is now a spur of I-10 from 1958 to 1968.\n\nRichard Ankrom signage\nIn 2001, Richard Ankrom, a local artist who got lost trying to get onto I-5 North from northbound I-110 because there was no clear official signage labeling access to I-5 North, solved his frustration by covertly modifying one of the overhead signs on the freeway just before the Four Level Interchange (34.055759\u00b0N 118.256181\u00b0W\ufeff \/ 34.055759; -118.256181). Using official government sign specifications, Ankrom fabricated two sign pieces, one being an I-5 marker shield and the other with the word \"NORTH\", and affixed them to the left side of the sign. He performed his modifications in broad daylight, disguised as a Caltrans worker. In that district, Caltrans has three sign crews, each thinking one of the other two crews did the installation. After nine months, at Ankrom's request, the Los Angeles Downtown News broke the story.\nPrior to Ankrom's work, the only signage directing motorists to the I-5 North off-ramp came at a quarter-mile (0.4 km) before the exit, thus forcing many to merge across multiple lanes in a very short distance. The signs were inspected by Caltrans to ensure they would not fall off onto the road below. Ankrom was never charged, despite statements from officials that his actions were illegal. Ankrom referred to his sign project as \"Guerilla Public Service\".\nCaltrans later added an additional \"5 North\" sign over the left northbound lane at the entrance to the Figueroa Street Tunnels, as well as new electric signage, which will note when an additional lane is available for those wishing to transition to northbound I-5 (converting the current single lane transition to dual lanes).\nIn 2009, Caltrans replaced all signage along this segment with newer, more reflective versions. These new signs include Ankrom's original improvements.\n\nPreservation\nDespite the increased traffic in Los Angeles, including trucks shipping products from the Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro, there are no plans to upgrade the rest of I-110 from I-10 to Pasadena to Interstate standards. Instead, Caltrans has pushed for a protected status alternative to preserve the Arroyo Seco Parkway as a historic landmark. The state legislature designated the original section, north of the Figueroa Street Viaduct, as a \"California Historic Parkway\" (part of the State Scenic Highway System reserved for freeways built before 1945) in 1993; the only other highway so designated is the Cabrillo Freeway (SR 163) in San Diego. The American Society of Civil Engineers named it a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1999, and it became a National Scenic Byway in 2002.\n\nExit list\nThe entire route is in Los Angeles County.\n\nSee also\nCalifornia Roads portal\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nCaltrans: I-110 highway conditions\nCaltrans Traffic Conditions Map\nCalifornia Highway Patrol Traffic Incidents\nMetro ExpressLanes \u2013 includes toll information on the I-110 Express Lanes\nA written account of Richard Ankrom's sign modification\nAnkrom's Web page about the signs\nCalifornia Highways - Interstate 110\nHarbor Freeway @ Asphaltplanet.ca\nCalifornia @ AARoads.com - Interstate 110 and California 110","85":"\"Free Fallin\" is the opening track from American musician Tom Petty's debut solo album, Full Moon Fever (1989). The song was written by Petty and his writing partner for the album, Jeff Lynne, and features Lynne on backing vocals and bass guitar. The duo wrote and recorded the single in two days, making it the first song completed for Full Moon Fever.\n\"Free Fallin'\" is one of Petty's most famous tracks as well as his highest - and longest - charting song. It peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in January 1990, becoming his third and final top ten hit. Petty and The Heartbreakers performed the song at the MTV Video Music Awards in 1989, with Axl Rose and Izzy Stradlin, and at the February 2008 Super Bowl XLII Halftime Show. The song is ranked No. 219 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. It was featured in the film Jerry Maguire (1996) and The Sopranos episode 2.13, \"Funhouse\" (2000). Lou Reed selected the song as one of his \"picks of 1989\". The song reached No. 2 on the Spotify Global Viral 50 following Petty's death in 2017.\n\nDevelopment and meaning\nPetty explained in an interview with Billboard magazine that he and Jeff Lynne were sitting around trying to come up with a song, and Lynne got him to say \"free falling\". The next day they recorded the song. Petty did not write the song about a specific person, but instead about what he saw during his frequent drives along Ventura Boulevard. Lynne said \"Probably the second song we wrote [for Full Moon Fever] was 'Free Fallin'.' I got the chords to it and we both fleshed out the chorus. It was like 'Evil Woman' in that we got a repetitive chord sequence and then the melody turns into a chorus. Everyone who heard it knew it was a hit, and the next song we did was 'I Won\u2019t Back Down.'\"\n\nReception\n\"Free Fallin'\" is widely regarded as one of Petty's best songs.

Hay. Alla Nazimova acquired the property in 1919: she converted it into a residential hotel in 1926 by adding 25 villas around the residence, which opened as the \"Garden of Alla Hotel\" in January 1927. In 1930, new owners renamed it the \"Garden of Allah Hotel\" (adding an 'h'). The property operated under a succession of owners for three decades until the last, Bart Lytton, owner of Lytton Savings & Loan, demolished the hotel in 1959 and replaced it with his bank's main branch.  The Lytton Savings main branch was later demolished along with a strip mall next to it to make way for a mixed-use development designed by Frank Gehry.\n\nHistory\nHayvenhurst\nThe estate that later became the Garden of Allah Hotel was built in 1913 by real estate developer William H. Hay in the northwest corner of the Crescent Heights neighborhood, a 160-acre (65 ha) tract bounded by Sunset Boulevard on the north, Santa Monica Boulevard on the south, Crescent Avenue (later renamed Fairfax Avenue) on the east and Sweetzer Avenue on the west, which Hay had subdivided and developed starting in 1905.\nThe estate's original address was 8080 Sunset Boulevard but was later changed to 8152. It occupied a 2.5-acre (1.0 ha) lot that fronted Sunset Boulevard and was bounded by Crescent Heights Boulevard on the east and Hayvenhurst (now spelled Havenhurst) Drive on the west. The property's southern boundary was also the border between the Hollywood district of the city of Los Angeles and the then-unincorporated area that later became the city of West Hollywood.\nHay and his wife Katherine personally supervised construction of the estate. The house had twelve rooms and four bathrooms. The finishes were all in Circassian walnut that the Hays had collected on a trip to the Philippines in 1912. The interior walls were covered in canvas and hand-painted. The garage had bays for two cars\u2014a rarity in those days\u2014with rooms upstairs for live-in servants. Construction and landscaping cost an estimated $30,000.\nThe Hays' stay at Hayvenhurst was short-lived. Within a few years they had built and moved into a new house a few blocks east, at 7920 Sunset Boulevard, the site today of the Directors Guild of America headquarters. William Hay also purchased Encino Ranch, a large tract of land in the San Fernando Valley that he would later develop into the upscale Encino neighborhood of Los Angeles. Hayvenhurst reportedly stood unoccupied for several years.\n\nGarden of Alla\nStage and screen actress Alla Nazimova leased Hayvenhurst from William Hay not long after she moved to Los Angeles from New York in 1918. She purchased it outright in 1919. Nazimova jokingly called her new home \"The Garden of Alla\", which was a reference to her own name and the best-selling 1904 novel The Garden of Allah, by British author Robert S. Hichens.\nFaced with a financial crisis in the mid-1920s after her screen career derailed, Nazimova put her property to work generating an income by building a complex of 25 rental \"villas\" around the original house. The opening party for \"The Garden of Alla Hotel\" was held on January 9, 1927. She found her role as a hotel manager unsuitable and discovered that her unscrupulous partners in the enterprise had nearly bankrupted her, so in 1928 she sold out her remaining interest in the property, auctioned off most of her furniture and other household goods, and went back to the Broadway stage. By 1930, the owners had normalized the spelling in the hotel's name to \"Allah\".\nAfter Nazimova's renewed Broadway success was cut short by illness in 1938, she returned to Hollywood and rented Villa 24, where she lived until her death in 1945.\n\nGarden of Allah Hotel\nCatering to both short-term and long-term guests, the hotel soon gained a reputation as a place where the famous could enjoy living in a quaint, cozy, village-like setting, conveniently located yet shielded from gawking tourists and autograph seekers by discreet security patrols, under a management that was not inclined to probe, judge or interfere with the private \u2014 and sometimes public \u2014 activities of its often unconventional patrons.\nThe Garden of Allah became home to many celebrities and literary figures. F. Scott Fitzgerald lived there for several months in 1937\u201338 at the beginning of his final stay in Hollywood. He wrote himself a postcard while there: \"Dear Scott \u2014 How are you? Have been meaning to come in and see you. I have living [sic] at the Garden of Allah. Yours, Scott Fitzgerald.\" Fitzgerald's biographer and lover Sheilah Graham later wrote a book about the place, titled simply The Garden of Allah.\nHumorist and actor Robert Benchley was a frequent resident. An array of Golden Age Hollywood stars and featured players, ranging from Greta Garbo to Ronald Reagan, stayed there at least briefly, and so did classical music giants Sergei Rachmaninoff (who was musically assaulted there by an annoyed Harpo Marx), Igor Stravinsky and Jascha Heifetz. Humphrey Bogart lived in villa 8, where Errol Flynn stayed when Bogart was out of town. Gloria Stuart and Arthur Sheekman lived at villa 12. Dance band leaders Benny Goodman and Artie Shaw and vocalist Frank Sinatra were among the pop music personalities. Kay Thompson, then designing musical numbers for Judy Garland and her own nightclub act with The Williams Brothers, lived there; Thompson later wrote about a little girl who also lived in a hotel, Eloise.\n\nPurchase by Lytton Savings and the site today\nAlthough celebrities such as Errol Flynn were still calling it home as late as 1957, by that time the hotel's architectural style was long out of fashion and its environs had become more tacky than glamorous. Land values were rising, historic preservation was still an eccentric notion, and \"redevelopment\" was a popular civic buzzword.\nOn April 11, 1959, Bart Lytton, president of Lytton Savings and Loan, announced that he had purchased the Garden of Allah Hotel from Beatrice Rosenus and Morris Markowitz for $755,000. Lytton's plans for the property included razing the hotel to make way for a new main branch for his bank, which had formerly been headquartered in the Canoga Park neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley.\nOn August 22, 1959, Lytton hosted a farewell party on the grounds of the hotel. Among the attendees was silent film star Francis X. Bushman, who had been at the opening party in 1927. Some other guests came costumed as old-time stars. In a nod to the hotel's creator, Nazimova's experimental 1923 silent film Salom\u00e9 was shown on a large poolside screen. On August 30, an on-site public auction liquidated all the furnishings, fixtures and equipment, along with odds and ends valuable only as souvenirs. Demolition permits were issued on November 2. Within days, all traces of the hotel were gone and construction of the bank building, designed by the Los Angeles-based architect Kurt Meyer in the Brutalist architectural style, had begun. The bank building was completed by 1960.  By 1962, the bank building received an adjacent addition consisting of a museum and an auditorium called the Lytton Center. By 1968, only eight years after the bank building's completion, Lytton Savings was forced to declare bankruptcy, resulting in the closure of the bank building. The adjacent Lytton Center was later closed the following year and converted into a strip mall. By the time the 2010s rolled around, the building was now home to a Chase bank. In 2016, the building was designated a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument. However, in the same year, real estate developer Townscapes Partners secured approvals for a mixed-use development designed by architect Frank Gehry, which would require the razing of the former bank building.  In response to this, the Los Angeles Conservancy and Friends of Lytton Savings advocacy group waged a preservation campaign to help prevent the building's demolition but ultimately, it was unsuccessful.  By April 2021, the building was demolished while the adjacent strip mall (formerly Lytton Center) was demolished much later. As of 2023, the redevelopment of the site failed to push through, leaving the site nothing but an empty lot.\n\nMiniature model\nIn 1960, the Garden of Allah reappeared on the site in the form of a detailed miniature model of the complex. For many years, this was on display outside Lytton's building, in a small plaza at the corner of Sunset and Crescent Heights, sheltered from the elements in a sort of shrine with a lofty domed pavilion. It was later moved indoors and eventually disappeared. It resurfaced in private hands in the early 2010s, architecturally intact and with its built-in miniature electric lighting system restored.\n\nSource of the name\nThe hotel's name was not a direct reference to Islam but rather to Nazimova's first name and the title of a 1905 novel, The Garden of Allah, by British writer Robert S. Hichens. The novel was adapted into a play first produced in London in 1909. Mary Mannering acted in the play in 1910. The novel also served as the basis for three movies, the final one of which starred Marlene Dietrich, who was once a resident of the hotel.\n\nQuotes about the Garden of Allah\nIt reminds me of Hollywood.\nI'll be damned if I'll believe anyone lives in a place called the Garden of Allah.\nNothing interrupted the continual tumult that was life at the Garden of Allah. Now and then the men in white came with a van and took somebody away, or bankruptcy or divorce or even jail claimed a participant in its strictly unstately sarabands. Nobody paid any mind.\nA light-hearted, unrealistic place.\nThere is no place for a Garden of Allah that, for one brief moment, was Camelot. It was inevitable that Hollywood as we knew it, and its satellite, Alla's garden, should disappear together.\nHollywood's and thus America's most unconventional hotel, actually \"notorious\" would be a more descriptive word.\nIn that lavish heyday of the parvenu, when everything was built to look like something it wasn't, a bungalow court with accommodations indistinguishable from a hundred other bungalow courts came to be called the Garden of Allah\n\nFamous residents and guests\nA representative list of the Garden of Allah Hotel's famous guests:\n\nIn popular culture\nIn 1956, just a few years before its demise, the Garden of Allah was one of the settings for Pamela Moore's novel Chocolates for Breakfast, the story of a teenage girl growing up with an actress mother.\nThe Garden of Allah Hotel is mentioned in chapter 2 of the Ronald Reagan biography Killing Reagan by Bill O'Reilly. In the late 1940s it was where \"Reagan reaches bottom when he wakes up one morning at the Garden of Allah Hotel on Sunset Boulevard and does not know the name of the woman lying next to him\".\nThe Mambo Kings (1992) used the location as a set in the film\nHerman Wouk called the Garden \"Rainbow's End\" in Youngblood Hawke, his novel about a successful writer who goes to Hollywood.\nIt is apparently an urban legend that the bulldozing of the Garden of Allah in 1959 inspired the line in Joni Mitchell's song \"Big Yellow Taxi\", \"They paved paradise and put up a parking lot\". Indeed, Mitchell later lived in the Laurel Canyon neighborhood in the hills north of the site. However, in an interview in the early 1970s, Mitchell stated that the lyrics were inspired in 1970 by her first trip to Hawaii, where she was struck by a jarring juxtaposition of nature and modern civilization. Also, the next line after \"They paved paradise and put up a parking lot\" is \"With a pink hotel, a boutique and a swinging hot spot\", which does not reflect what happened to the Garden of Allah site itself, on which a bank building was erected. There was, however, also a large parking lot on the site to serve that building; the nearby Chateau Marmont hotel and at least one other big, pinkish and even nearer residential building overlooked it; boutiques abounded on the Sunset Strip; and the \"swinging\", politically hot Pandora's Box nightclub was directly across Crescent Heights in the 1960s. The existence of a secondary source of inspiration has apparently not been explicitly denied in Mitchell's published comments.\nA 1985 play Across from the Garden of Allah by Charles Wood starred Glenda Jackson and Nigel Hawthorne. It was a marital drama set in a hotel across the street from the Garden of Allah.\nThe hotel is the setting for a series of historical novels by Martin Turnbull that began with The Garden on Sunset (2012).\nIn the 2013 film Gangster Squad, a signboard reading \"Garden of Allah\" is seen outside the apartment in which Ryan Gosling's character resides, just before the scene in which he wakes up with Emma Stone.\nThe location of the Garden of Allah, which is now a bank building, is prominently displayed in a comical scene from the 1987 movie Barfly starring Mickey Rourke.\nFormer Eagles singer and drummer Don Henley released the 1995 song Garden of Allah in honor of the hotel.\nJonathan Winters, then appearing on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, described getting drunk one time with Johnny Carson at the hotel, years before becoming sober.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nHistory of the Garden of Allah with photos\nThe Vanished Garden of Carnal Abandon\nTime Magazine article on closing of Garden of Allah in 1959\nTCM Movie Morlocks article on the Garden of Allah Archived 2008-12-31 at the Wayback Machine","88":"Garvey Avenue is a west-east thoroughfare in the San Gabriel Valley.

The venue was a staple of the Los Angeles music scene from the 1960s until the early 1990s. The Doors and Van Halen were featured house bands there before being signed to major record labels. It was the backdrop for Huey Lewis and the News' short form promotional music video for their 1984 hit The Heart of Rock and Roll.\n\nHistory\nGazzarri's Hollywood a Go Go opened with performances by the Sinners, who became the house band, the Vendells and the Gazzarri dancers on June 1, 1965. The nightclub's early history is closely associated with the Los Angeles-based television show Hollywood a Go Go, which would feature the Sinners and the Gazzarri dancers. \nIn 1965, KHJ disc jockey Roger Christian made weekly appearances at Gazzarri's Hollywood a Go Go. Performers at the nightclub in 1965 and 1966 include the Turtles, Billy Peek, Ike & Tina Turner, and Pat & Lolly Vegas. The nightclub also featured actor Edward James Olmos, with his band Eddie James and the Pacific Ocean as the house band in 1966. \nGazzarri's reached its peak of popularity in the late 1960s, featuring Jim Morrison's young new group, along with other talent such as ? and the Mysterians, The Bobby Fuller Four, Buffalo Springfield and The Walker Brothers. It then achieved major L.A. relevance again in the late 1970s, featuring the David Lee Roth-led Van Halen nightly for months on end, and then into the 1980s through the early 1990s as one of the top L.A. glam metal nightclubs. It was owned and operated by Bill Gazzarri, who was known for dressing up as a Chicago-style gangster and frequenting the club on performance nights. \nLocated near the corner of Doheny and Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood, and just several dozen yards from both the Rainbow Bar and Grill and The Roxy Theatre, Gazzarri's became famous as a launching pad for future rock and roll stars. Along with the Roxy Theatre, the Whisky a Go Go, the Troubadour, the Starwood and other nearby nightclubs, Gazzarri's was a staple of the Los Angeles music scene. Some other bands that played at Gazzarri's either prior to or during their mainstream success include Johnny Rivers, Van Halen, ? and the Mysterians, NEWHAVEN, SouthGang, Sonny and Cher, Ratt, Cinderella, Chicano rock band Renegade, Victor Flamingo, Quiet Riot, Stryper, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, Poison, Guns N' Roses, Warrant, and Faster Pussycat. Other notable local Los Angeles area bands to play there included Redd Kross, Brunette, Shark Island, Nightwatch and Hurricane (band). Some of the bands to play Gazzarri's were featured in The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years, such as Salute, Shocktop and Broken Cherry. Many giant hand-painted pictures of these bands adorned the side of the club's outside wall for many years.  Actress-singer Mamie Van Doren even did her 1985 comeback show there.\n\nThe 90-yard stretch of sidewalk on Sunset Boulevard that runs from the front steps of Gazzarri's (now 1 Oak, 9039 West Sunset Blvd.) to the parking lot between the Rainbow Bar and Grill (9015 West Sunset Blvd.) and the Roxy Theatre (9009 West Sunset Blvd.) was the national center of the 1980s glam metal movement that spawned dozens of MTV bands and radio hits. Aspiring bands and musicians from around the world, coming to Los Angeles to make it big, eventually found themselves on this street passing out their flyers, watching the competition in the clubs or enjoying the scene packed with thousands of other musicians, famous rock stars, porn stars, groupies and Los Angeles teenagers.\nThe nightclub also moonlighted variously over the years a stage-dance venue, and Gazzarri's would often feature the strip-club style dancing of attractive, young girls between live band performances. The \"Miss Gazzarri's Dancers\" included future Playboy Playmate and Hugh Hefner girlfriend Barbi Benton as well as future television star Catherine Bach. The club became a favorite hangout for teen dancers who loved live music, which was not lost on the neighboring television studios. Gazzarri's was acknowledged by TV executives as the real-life inspiration for music-based TV shows such as Don Kirshner's Rock Concert, The Monkees and The Partridge Family.\nGazzarri's was also featured in the 1974 pilot of The Rockford Files and was the location for the Crazy Horse West strip club in the 1976 film The Killing of a Chinese Bookie and the 1987 MGM film Number One With A Bullet.\n\nPay-to-play\nThe club was part of the controversial \"pay-to-play\" concept in the 1980s, along with other major Hollywood nightclubs that showcased bands with original songs. As many as four bands per night would each buy 100 to 200 tickets from the club at around $5, handing over in advance hundreds of dollars to the owner for a 45-minute slot on the famous stage. Soon, many bands were spending as much time promoting, handing out flyers, advertising in local magazines and building mailing lists as they were on songwriting, practicing and actually gigging live. Young, hungry bands such as Poison, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, Van Halen and Guns N' Roses became early masters of self-promotion as a result, developing street-smart business skills that would serve them even as world-renowned superstars. Axl Rose stated several times in interviews that the \"L.A. scene was so competitive, if half the bands in the Top 40 right now had tried to get their big break in L.A. instead of somewhere else, they never would have made it.\"\n\nAfter\nBill Gazzarri died in 1991 and the club closed down in 1993. In 1994, the building suffered irreparable damage from the Northridge earthquake. It was torn down in 1995 and a new club called Billboard Live opened at the former Gazzarri's site in 1996. Billboard Live became The Key Club in 1998. The Key Club held its final show on March 14, 2013  and was replaced by the nightclub 1 Oak later that year. 1 Oak operated until 2022 when new owners announced a new yet-to-be-named club was under development but had yet to open by spring 2024.\n\nLive at the Key Club\nPhil Seymour In Concert!

A month later, on December 31, 1933, La Crescenta and the neighboring city of Glendale received more than 12 inches of rain. The rain following the fire caused trees, dirt, and boulders, the size of cars, to slide onto the streets of the city. This caused severe flooding; 39 people were found dead and 44 were missing.

They would congregate at that particular street corner, which is how it acquired its nickname. The Columbia Drug Store, which stood on the southeast corner for several decades, was a hangout for many western film extras in hopes of finding work, knowing the casting agents from the studio could reach them there. John Wayne, Gene Autry, and Roy Rogers all got their start in this neighborhood, as did director John Ford. Columbia Studios was filming western films about every ten days for a time. The cowboy extras stood at the corner already dressed in their Stetson hats, boots, and bandannas, ready for saloon scenes, as cattle rustlers, or as members of a posse. The pay was about $5 a day or $10 for a minor speaking role.\nCharlie Chaplin made some of his first movies in this area.\nIn February 1940, actor Jerome Bonaparte \"Blackjack\" Ward became involved in a homicide on Sunset Boulevard at Gower Gulch, near Columbia Pictures studios when he shot and killed stuntman and background actor Johnny Tyke.\nA strip mall, Gower Gulch Plaza, \"paying homage to the past\" and designed in the style of an Old West backlot was built in 1976 on the southwest corner of Sunset and Gower. The name \"Gower Gulch\" is painted on the side of a vintage western medicine show wagon. The strip mall remains unchanged as of 2014 and has been described as \"Old West kitsch\".\n\nIn pop culture\nIn the Warner Bros. 1943 movie Thank Your Lucky Stars, Gower Gulch is a hilltop neighborhood in Los Angeles, where struggling actors and musicians live in caravans and cottages cobbled together from movie sets and gathered around an old house. It is located \"only 4 minutes from Vine Street,\" according to one of the characters. The Hollywoodland sign blinks in the background on its distant hill.\nA B-movie was released in 1950 called The Kid from Gower Gulch starring Spade Cooley. In the film, singer Red Murrell sings a song called \"Gower Gulch is Home Sweet Home\".\nThe November 13, 1948, episode of the CBS West Coast radio detective series Jeff Regan, Private Investigator is entitled \"The Guy from Gower Gulch\"; its plot revolves around a missing South American racehorse and its connections to a travelogue.\nThe name Gower Gulch also appears in the Warner Bros. 1950 cartoon All a Bir-r-r-rd.  It is the name of a western-looking town Tweety's train passes through.\nIn another Warner Bros. 1951 cartoon, Drip-Along Daffy, Porky Pig sings a Michael Maltese-written song entitled \"The Flower of Gower Gulch\". Another version of the song is performed in the Warner Bros. animated short Nelly's Folly.\nIn the 1942 Abbott and Costello film Ride 'Em Cowboy a bus depot is identified as Gower Gulch by a hanging sign.\nIn the biopic Mank, Gower Gulch is referenced at 34' 07\" in the MGM offices.\n\n\n== References ==","93":"Gower Street is a street in Los Angeles, California that has played an important role in the ongoing evolution of Hollywood, particularly as the home to several prominent Poverty Row studios during the area's Golden Age. It marks the eastern terminus of the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nLocation\nGower Street begins at the corner of 1st Street (Los Angeles) in the Hancock Park district as a residential street, becomes primarily industrial, and then commercial as it bisects the Hollywood district, becomes residential again north of Franklin Avenue, and terminates in Beachwood Canyon at Beachwood Drive near the Hollywood Sign. Gower Street marks the western boundary of the Hollywood Forever Cemetery just south of Santa Monica Boulevard.\n\nOrigin of the name\nA farmer from Hawaii named John T. Gower brought in the area's first harvesting equipment and built his home near this street before his death in 1880, a time when Hollywood was an independent city. Upon Hollywood's annexation by the city of Los Angeles in 1910, this street was named in his honor.\n\nMovie studios\nMany of the original Hollywood movie studios were located on or near Gower Street. The Paramount Pictures lot sits on the corner of Gower Street and Melrose Avenue; further north, the Sunset Gower Studios (formerly the Columbia Pictures lot) sit on the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Gower.\n\nFirst studio\nGower Street was the location of the first motion picture studio built in Hollywood. Nestor Studios, founded by David and William Horsley and operated by Al Christie in 1911, the Christie Studios occupied a building at the northwest corner of Gower Street and Sunset Boulevard. Later, this same location was home to the Columbia Drugstore, famous for a soda fountain, frequented by many young movie stars. The drugstore was also home to an outdoor magazine and newspaper vendor where many celebrities bought their hometown newspapers.\nThe original Nestor Studios site went through various owners until the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) bought it in 1935. CBS demolished Hollywood's historic first studio, and built a $2 million facility that set the stage for the era of television in Hollywood.\n\nGower Gulch\nBeginning in the 1930s, Gower Street earned the nickname \"Gower Gulch\" because of the many extras in Westerns who would dress in their cowboy costumes at home, then walk south to Paramount and RKO studios, which were all located just off Gower Street south of Sunset Boulevard. Today, a strip-mall named \"Gower Gulch\", built to resemble a Western set, sits on the southwest corner of Sunset and Gower as a reminder of that era. The phrase \"Gower Gulch\" is painted on an actual chuck wagon that sits on the site of the old \"Copper Skillet\" coffee shop, where the cowboys used to have their breakfast.\nGower Street became very well known to wartime movie audiences in the film Thank Your Lucky Stars (1943) when Dennis Morgan and Joan Leslie visit \"Gower Gulch\". They hear Spike Jones and His City Slickers at the movie colony village situated at the northern end of Gower Street in the Hollywood Hills. Although the scene is a set built in the studio, it is a faithful replica of the actual village that stood there built from discarded movie sets.\n\nReferences in popular culture\nThe street was the subject of a comic song heard in a 1951 Warner Bros. \"Daffy Duck\" cartoon called \"Drip-Along Daffy\". The song is called \"The Flower of Gower Gulch\" and was written by Michael Maltese (1908\u20131981), though he is uncredited in the actual short.\nThe street was also featured in the Warren Zevon song \"Desperados Under the Eaves\", though referred to as \"Gower Avenue\" to preserve the meter of the song.\n\nHollywood Walk of Fame\nThe Hollywood Walk of Fame (which runs east to west on Hollywood Boulevard) begins at the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Gower Street.","94":"Grand Avenue is a major north\u2013south thoroughfare in Los Angeles, California.

Haldeman and his wife. It is situated on Sunset Boulevard in Holmby Hills, Los Angeles. Hadleman was the owner of a Chrysler car dealership in Los Angeles. He was not related to Harry F. Haldeman who was the father of President Richard Nixon's White House Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman. The house was completed in 1939 and was sold by the Haldemans to J. M. Friedman in 1947. The businessman Howard Hughes was the first person to rent the house from the Friedman. Hughes rented the house for his future wife Jean Peters. The actress Terry Moore, who claimed she was married to Hughes, first met him at the house.\nThe house was featured in the January 1941 issue of Architectural Digest magazine, photographed by Maynard L. Parker, and in California Arts & Architecture in 1940. Elizabeth Jean McMillian wrote in her 2002 book California Colonial: The Spanish and Rancho Revival Styles that the house \"emphasiz[es] the horizontality of the structure\" being \"flush to the ground of a grass forecourt...originally decorated with classical urns\".\nThe house was subsequently occupied by Judy Garland, who rented the house for $1,000 a month in 1949. It was the first home of Garland and her husband Vincent Minnelli's daughter, Liza Minnelli. Garland and Minnelli were estranged; whilst she lived at the Haldeman house, he lived on Evanview Drive. Garland attempted suicide in June 1950 at Minnelli's residence, and was quickly brought to the Haldeman House by her manager, Carleton Alsop. Newspaper reporters had believed that Garland and Minnelli were living together on Evanview Drive, but Alsop's car had been followed, and the Haldeman House was quickly under siege by reporters. A representative from MGM Studios subsequently left the house by the front door after visiting Garland and drew his finger across his throat, thus indirectly telling reporters what had occurred. Sid Luft, Garland's third husband, recalled the house as a \"charming house, rather rustic with a large fireplace\" and a \"cozy, secure retreat with an unhampered view of the hills\".\nIt was subsequently rented by actress Jennifer Jones. The house was featured in the 1950 film Sunset Boulevard; the actor William Holden was chased into the driveway of the house by men seeking to repossess his car. Friedman put the house up for sale in 1954. It was sold in 1955 to Charles Babcock, the heir to the American Tobacco Company.\nStatues sculpted by J. Seward Johnson Jr. were prominently adorned the property in the 1980s; these would draw tourists and sightseers to the house. Sculptures included two tennis players, children climbing the perimeter wall, and a photographer and architect.\nThe house was subsequently owned by Los Angeles Real Estate Investor Stanley Black, his wife the late Joyce Black and their children.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n10000 Sunset Boulevard at Wikimapia","96":"Harvey Henderson Wilcox (c. 1832 \u2013 March 19, 1891) was an American landowner who registered the name Hollywood for his estate west of the city of Los Angeles in 1887.\nHollywood became the center of the movie industry of the United States in the early 1910s.\n\nBiography\nHarvey Henderson Wilcox was born in New York State, most likely in Monroe or Ontario County, the son of Aaron and Azubah (Mark) Wilcox. The family moved to Michigan during the 1830s and Harvey was raised on his parents' farm in Ogden Township, Lenawee County, Michigan. He contracted poliomyelitis in 1845 when he was about 13 years old and used a wheelchair the rest of his life. He is described as being a Kansas Prohibitionist in histories written after his death.\nIn September 1850 Harvey was described as being an apprentice shoemaker in the Horace Sheldon household in Blissfield, Lenawee County. His apprenticeship was probably because he could not do farm-work. He completed his apprenticeship during the 1850s and in 1860 he was living near Edgerton, St. Joseph Township, Williams County, Ohio, and working as a shoemaker. On December 26, 1861, he married Ellen E. Young in Bryan, Williams County, Ohio. He got into politics in Williams County and ran for, and was elected to, several local offices, including County Recorder in 1860, Justice of the Peace (Magistrate) in 1860, and Notary Public for Williams County in 1866.\nHe gave up shoemaking to deal in real estate in Bryan, in the firm of Wilcox & Langel, a career that he would follow the rest of his life. Elon Langel later moved to Topeka, Kansas, and died of tuberculosis.\nThe local Bryan newspaper says in April 1868 that Harvey and Ellen Wilcox were moving to Topeka, Kansas, where, in October, 1869, Harvey published \"H.H. Wilcox's Real Estate Publisher\"  and in July 1870 he was described as a real estate agent and his wife a housekeeper. Before March 1875 they had added G.M. Stanley, the son of Ellen's sister, Alvira, to their family, but they never had any children of their own. In June 1880 Harvey was still in real estate and Ellen was running their boarding house on Kansas Avenue.\nHarvey must have enjoyed being in politics in Bryan because in Topeka he got into politics again, serving as president of the city council for at least one term in 1870; joined several other men to found the town of Rossville, Kansas, in 1871; served as Topeka city clerk from at least 1877 through 1880; and owned a ranch and relatively large herd of cattle (that his adopted son, George M. Stanley, managed) near El Dorado in Butler County, Kansas.\nHarvey and Ellen were in the 1880 census of Topeka with George M. Stanley, the son of Ellen's sister, Alvira Stanley, in their household. Ellen contracted tuberculosis and spent the winter of 1881\u20131882 in California, probably staying with her sister, Mary Jane (Young) Bond in Santa Barbara, \"chasing the cure\". Ellen returned to Topeka, uncured, in early 1882. She was kept alive on the train with \"powerful stimulants\" and died at the age of 37 soon after her arrival home. She is buried in Topeka Cemetery in Topeka, Kansas.\nHarvey married as his second wife, Daeida \"Ida\" Hartell, a woman more than thirty years his junior, on December 6, 1882, in Topeka and in October 1883 it was reported that \"Harvey Wilcox of Topeka, Kansas\" was back in Ohio and Michigan visiting relatives and friends. This was probably the last time most of his relatives back East saw him and the trip was probably made in anticipation of his permanent move to California.\n\nHollywood years\nHarvey and Ida moved from Topeka to Los Angeles in early 1883 and tradition says that Harvey rode in the baggage car with two of his prized horses. In Los Angeles Harvey formed the real estate company of Wilcox and Shaw. Harvey and Ida had one child, a son named Harry, who died in 1886 at the age of 18 months. Family tradition says that to console themselves over the death of their baby, Harvey and Ida would take buggy rides to the beautiful canyons west of Los Angeles. Harvey purchased one of their favorite areas for $150 per acre. It was in an agricultural area of fig and apricot orchards. Harvey tried his hand at raising fruit, but failed and decided to subdivide the land, selling lots for $1,000 each. His wife named the tract \"Hollywood.\" On February 1, 1887, Harvey filed a plat of the subdivision with the Los Angeles County Recorder's office. He would also develop residential property, \"The University Tract,\" surrounding the newly built University of Southern California in 1887.\nHarvey and Ida were not the only members of the family to move to California. At his encouragement, his sister Sarah Luke, brother-in-law Elisha Luke, with her mother, Azubah, took the Atlantic & Pacific Railroad from Ogden to Los Angeles in November 1885 according to Adrian Weekly Press, November 13, 1885. The Lukes planned to stay only for the winter months, but Azaubah intended to remain with her son, Harvey, for the rest of her life. In February 1887 the Lukes and their daughter and son-in-law, Sam and Rosetta Young, with their young son, Almon, and Harvey's recently remarried brother Lewis, left Ogden to permanently settle in Los Angeles where Elisha would also become a real estate agent and land developer. The \"Blissfield [Michigan] Advance\" said in its Friday, February 18, 1887, edition that \"Sam Young and wife and Elisha Luke and wife started for California last Thursday. Thus Ogden loses two of its staunch farmers, and the Prohibs, two valuable members.\"\nHarvey's brother Lewis Wilcox would soon leave California to return to Lenawee County where he would continue as a minister of the United Brethren church in Dundee, Michigan, until his death ten years later. Azubah died in Los Angeles in 1888 and was buried on the Luke family lot in Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery, her son, Harvey, would be buried next to her in 1891.\nHarvey's brother, Horace, is often credited as being a founder of Hollywood, but Horace, who was one of Harvey's younger brothers, stayed in Michigan where he married first Amanda McCourtie and after her death in 1880, Martha Lord. Horace raised purebred Shropshire sheep on his farm in Woodstock Township, Lenawee County, Michigan, was also the Woodstock School Inspector, and a teacher until his death in 1916.\nThere is no original source that says Harvey H. Wilcox was a Prohibitionist, although he probably was. The only known active Prohibitionists in the family were his sister, Sarah, and her husband, Elisha Luke, and almost certainly Harvey's brothers, twins Lewis and Luther, both of whom were ministers.\n\nDeath\nHarvey was about fifty-nine years old when he died at his sister-in-law Sylvia Connell's home where he had come two weeks earlier so he could be closer to medical care in Los Angeles. He left a twenty-eight-year-old widow. His funeral was held from the First Methodist church in Hollywood, of which he was a member.\nHarvey's obituary in the Adrian newspaper, Michigan Messenger, April 1, 1891, says that he left a fortune of $100,000 ($2.37 million in 2008 dollars), so obviously he did not die penniless as some histories suggest. This obituary also confirms his place in the Aaron and Azubah Wilcox family, mentioning his brother, Lewis Wilcox, who at that time lived in Adrian.\nThree years after Harvey's death, Daeida, then aged 31, married Philo J. Beveridge, the son of a former governor of Illinois, and a man thirteen years her senior. They had three children.\nWilcox was originally buried alongside his mother, Azubah (Mark) Wilcox, in Rosedale Cemetery, but on November 13, 1922, his remains were moved to Hollywood Memorial Park Cemetery, today named Hollywood Forever Memorial Park where he is interred next to his second wife, Ida.\n\nSee also\nCategory:Hollywood, Los Angeles history and culture\nHollywood Sign\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nHarvey Henderson Wilcox at Find a Grave","97":"There are 9 routes assigned to the \"N\" zone of the California Route Marker Program, which designates county routes in California.

It is a major thoroughfare between Cahuenga Boulevard\/U.S. Route 101 in Hollywood at the north and Wilshire Boulevard in Mid-Wilshire at the south, and a residential street from Wilshire Boulevard to Washington Boulevard in Mid-City.\n\nName\nHighland Avenue was named after Highland Mary Price, a Hollywood resident \nwho died from a brain tumor in 1901.\n\nDescription\nHighland Avenue runs north-south between Cahuenga Boulevard\/U.S. Route 101 and Washington Boulevard. It travels through the Los Angeles neighborhoods of Hollywood, Hancock Park, Mid-Wilshire, and Mid-City.\nHighland contains four lanes for most of its length, but narrows to two from south of Wilshire Boulevard to Washington Boulevard. Furthermore, Highland is broken up three times south of Wilshire, at Edgewood Place, San Vicente Boulevard, and Venice Boulevard. For through access, Highland traffic merges onto Edgewood Place which accesses La Brea Avenue. \nThe segment of Highland from U.S. Route 101 to Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood was once designated as part of California State Route 170. California's legislature has since relinquished control of that segment, and the portion is now maintained by the City of Los Angeles.\n\nLandmarks\nThe Hollywood Bowl is located at the northern end of Highland, just below U.S. Route 101. The Hollywood Heritage Museum, Highland-Camrose Bungalow Village, and American Legion Post 43 are also located on Highland in this area, as is Hollywood United Methodist Church, located at Highland and Franklin Avenue.\nFurther south is the famous intersection of Hollywood and Highland, the northwest corner of which was formerly home to the Hollywood Hotel and currently home to the Hollywood & Highland Center and Dolby Theatre. Hollywood First National, Lee Drug, and Bank of America Building are also located at this intersection, as is the B Line's Hollywood\/Highland station. The intersection itself is named Gene Autry Square, after the actor, musician, and businessman who was instrumental in developing the entertainment industry in this area.\nContinuing south, half a block from Hollywood and Highland is the Hollywood Museum located in the historic Max Factor Salon, and across the street and half a block south from that is Hollywood High School, which continues south to the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Highland. Near the entrance to the school, the intersection of Highland and Selma is named Carol Burnett Square, after the famous actress and comedian who once went to school there.\nFurther south, Klasky Csupo is headquartered on Highland just south of Fountain Avenue, and south of that, Highland and Santa Monica Boulevard is named Steve McQueen Square, after the famous actor and racing driver. Continuing south, Highland runs adjacent to the Wilshire Country Club near Beverly Boulevard in Hancock Park. Additionally, Highland's median parkway between Melrose Avenue and Wilshire Boulevard features queen palms and Mexican fan palms that were planted in 1928 and designated Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument #94 in 1972. The intersection of Highland and 3rd Street is also in this section, and has been named Moshe Rubin Memorial Square.\n\nTransit\nThe B Line stops at Hollywood and Highland. The K Line Northern Extension also plans to terminate on Highland, either at Hollywood and Highland or the Hollywood Bowl.\nThe Los Angeles Department of Transportation runs the Hollywood DASH line in a clockwise and counterclockwise loop around Hollywood. This line travels on Highland between Fountain Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard.\n\n\n== References ==","99":"Hill Street is a major north\u2013south thoroughfare in Los Angeles, measuring 4.8 miles (7.7 km) in length.

Hill Street merges with the Arroyo Seco Parkway near Dodger Stadium.\n\nHistory\nHill Street was originally laid out in 1849 by Edward Ord. At that time, the street ended in the north at 1st Street, where the foot of Fort Hill sat. The stretch of modern Hill Street north of the old hill was originally named Calle del Toro (Bull Street), was renamed Castelar in 1874, and finally renamed North Hill in 1960.\n\nTransportation\nThe Metro B Line and Metro D Line run underneath Hill Street between 1st and 4th Streets and operate the Civic Center and Pershing Square stations along the way.

It was completed in 1924 and designed by Meyer & Holler, the same architectural firm that built the Grauman's Chinese Theatre and the Egyptian Theatre. At the time, it was the tallest building in Hollywood.\nWhen the Hollywood Athletic Club opened in 1924, Hollywood was entering its greatest and most productive period. The building was the tallest building in Hollywood and loomed above Sunset Boulevard. Membership was originally $150 for initiation fees and $10 for monthly dues.\nDuring its early years as a health club, its membership included Johnny Weissmuller, Errol Flynn, Charlie Chaplin, John Wayne, Walt Disney, John Ford, Douglas Fairbanks Sr., Mary Pickford, Cecil B. deMille, Cornel Wilde, Humphrey Bogart, Clark Gable, Jean Harlow, George O'Brien, Frances X. Bushman, Howard Hughes, Joan Crawford, Rudolph Valentino, Mae West, Buster Crabbe, and Pola Negri.\nWhen the building was first established, the first two floors and the basement were to be used only for clubbing. (Note: This statement may be about the Hollywood Athletic Club in Hollywood, FL. See note on Talk page.)\nThe building later became the University of Judaism, and after they started building at their new location, this building gradually fell into disrepair. The building was up for sale for eight years until concert promoter and investor Gary Berwin purchased it in 1978 and set about the huge task of restoring the building to its former grandeur.\nBerwin also purchased the bungalows and the two-story Spanish-style building situated on Hudson behind 6525 Sunset Blvd.  The project was renovated at a cost of approximately $11 million. The restaurant, which is a replica of the 14th century Davanzati Palace in Florence, Italy, underwent a complete makeover. The original ceilings had been covered over with a false ceiling and after it was removed, Berwin hired carpenters, artists, and wood carvers to restore the beams and ceilings.\nThe Berwin Entertainment Complex quickly became popular with the jet set and celebrities. Some of the famous tenants included the Beach Boys, Van Halen, Jose Feliciano, Island Records, and Baby-O Recording Studios. The list of celebrities who visited the building include Priscilla Presley, Lisa-Marie Presley, members of the Michael Jackson family, Steven Spielberg, Muhammad Ali (a regular visitor and friend), Mayor Tom Bradley, Sally Field, Princess Stephanie, Dudley Moore, Michael J Fox, Prince Mashour ben Saud of Saudi Arabia, Madonna, Rodney Dangerfield, Melanie Griffith, Lesley Ann Down, Jon Voigt, Paul Newman, George Lucas, Jaclyn Smith, Jane Fonda, Alice Cooper, Julio Iglesias, Stevie Wonder, Billy Crystal, Shirley McLane, and Gov. Jerry Brown.\nBerwin donated office space and worked with Mayor Tom Bradley's office to start a program for runaway youth in Hollywood. The building served as a fund-raising entity for the March of Dimes, the American Cancer Society, the Los Angeles Library Association, and the Thalians. In November 1983, the State of California recognized Gary Berwin's renovation efforts with the Hollywood Beautification Award. Presented by Senator David Roberti, the award was given in the category of remodeled community property.\nAt the end of 1984, Berwin decided to take in a partner or sell the building and in February 1985 real estate broker Bill Beachem, representing the Michael Jackson family, came by the building and made Berwin an offer. The Jacksons, who at the time were the #1 entertainment family in the world, would buy the building and Berwin would retain a percentage as a partner. They intended to use a good portion of the 80,000 square feet (7,400 m2) for offices and recording and rehearsal studios. Joe Jackson became an almost daily visitor to the building, the papers were signed, a deposit was put into escrow, phones were ordered, and a liquor license sign went up outside stating \u201cJackson\/Berwin Entertainment.\u201d\nThe Jacksons stipulated in the escrow instructions that while the building was in escrow, they would have final approval of everyone leasing space in the building. During this time period, many famous parties including record executive David Geffen, Studio 54, Maxim's of Paris, and Princess Stephanie of Monaco all came to the building inquiring about the possibility of renting space for studios and clubs, but the Jacksons would not approve any of them.\nIn 1983, Bryan Adams made his \u201cCuts Like A Knife\u201d music video in the empty pool.

Its name has come to be a shorthand reference for the U.S. film industry and the people associated with it. Many notable film studios, such as Sony Pictures, Walt Disney Studios, Paramount Pictures, Warner Bros. and Universal Pictures, are located near or in Hollywood.\nHollywood was incorporated as a municipality in 1903. The northern and eastern parts of the neighborhood were consolidated with the City of Los Angeles in 1910. Soon thereafter a prominent film industry emerged, having developed first on the East Coast. Eventually it became the most recognizable in the world.\n\nHistory\nInitial development\nH. J. Whitley, a real estate developer, arranged to buy the 480-acre (1.9 km2) E.C. Hurd ranch. Whitley shared his plans for the new town with General Harrison Gray Otis, publisher of the Los Angeles Times, and Ivar Weid, a prominent businessman in the area.\nDaeida Wilcox, who donated land to help in the development of Hollywood, learned of the name Hollywood from an acquaintance who owned an estate by that name in Illinois.\nWilcox is quoted as saying, \"I chose the name Hollywood simply because it sounds nice and because I'm superstitious and holly brings good luck.\"  She recommended the same name to her husband, Harvey H. Wilcox, who had purchased 120 acres on February 1, 1887. It was not until August 1887 that Wilcox decided to use that name and filed with the Los Angeles County Recorder's office on a deed and parcel map of the property.\nBy 1900, the region had a post office, newspaper, hotel, and two markets. Los Angeles, with a population of 102,479, lay 10 miles (16 km) east through the vineyards, barley fields, and citrus groves. A single-track streetcar line ran down the middle of Prospect Avenue from it, but service was infrequent and the trip took two hours. The old citrus fruit-packing house was converted into a livery stable, improving transportation for the inhabitants of Hollywood.\nThe Hollywood Hotel was opened in 1902 by Whitley, president of the Los Pacific Boulevard and Development Company. Having finally acquired the Hurd ranch and subdivided it, Whitley built the hotel to attract land buyers. Flanking the west side of Highland Avenue, the structure fronted on Prospect Avenue (later Hollywood Boulevard). Although it was still a dusty, unpaved road, it was regularly graded and graveled. The hotel became internationally known and was the center of the civic and social life and home of movie stars for many years.\nWhitley's company developed and sold one of the early residential areas, the Ocean View Tract. Whitley did much to promote the area. He paid thousands of dollars to install electricity and arrange for electric lighting, and he built both a bank and a road into the Cahuenga Pass. The lighting ran for several blocks down Prospect Avenue. Whitley's land was centered on Highland Avenue. His 1918 development, Whitley Heights, was named for him.\n\nIncorporation and merger\nHollywood was incorporated as a municipality on November 14, 1903, by a vote of 88 for and 77 against. On January 30, 1904, the voters in Hollywood decided, 113 to 96, to banish the sale of liquor within the city, except for medicinal purposes. Neither hotels nor restaurants were allowed to serve wine or liquor before or after meals.\nIn 1910, the city voted for a merger with Los Angeles in order to secure an adequate water supply and to gain access to the L.A. sewer system.\n\nWith annexation, the name of Prospect Avenue was changed to Hollywood Boulevard and all the street numbers in the new district changed. For example, 100 Prospect Avenue, at Vermont Avenue, became 6400 Hollywood Boulevard; and 100 Cahuenga Boulevard, at Hollywood Boulevard, changed to 1700 Cahuenga Boulevard.\n\nMotion picture industry\nBy 1912, major motion-picture companies had come West to set up production near or in Los Angeles.\nIn the early 1900s, most motion picture camera and equipment patents were held by Thomas Edison's Motion Picture Patents Company in New Jersey, which often sued filmmakers to stop their productions. To escape this, filmmakers began moving to Los Angeles, where attempts to enforce Edison's patents were easier to evade. Also, the weather was ideal for filmmaking and there was quick access to various settings. Los Angeles became the capital of the film industry in the United States. The mountains, plains and low land prices made Hollywood a good place to establish film studios.\nDirector D. W. Griffith was the first to make a motion picture in Hollywood. His 17-minute short film In Old California (1910) was filmed for the Biograph Company. Although Hollywood banned movie theaters\u2014of which it had none\u2014before annexation that year, Los Angeles had no such restriction.\nThe first studio in Hollywood opened in early 1913, on Formosa Avenue down the street from Helen Muir's home.:\u200a447\u200a Her father John Muir returned from his tour of Europe and East Africa a few months later and continued work on Yosemite and his book, The Yosemite.:\u200a447\u200a The Nestor Film Company was the first studio, established in October 1911 by the New Jersey-based Centaur Film Company in a roadhouse at 6121 Sunset Boulevard (the corner of Gower). Four major film companies \u2013 Paramount, Warner Bros., RKO, and Columbia \u2013 had studios in Hollywood, as did several minor companies and rental studios. In the 1920s, Hollywood was the fifth-largest industry in the nation. By the 1930s, Hollywood studios became fully vertically integrated, as production, distribution and exhibition was controlled by these companies, enabling Hollywood to produce 600 films per year.\nHollywood became known as Tinseltown\nand the \"dream factory\" because of the glittering image of the movie industry.\n\nFurther development\nA large sign reading HOLLYWOODLAND was erected in the Hollywood Hills in 1923 to advertise real estate developers Woodruff's and Shoults' housing development. In 1949, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce entered a contract with the City of Los Angeles to repair and rebuild the sign. The agreement stipulated that LAND be removed to spell HOLLYWOOD so the sign would now refer to the district, rather than the housing development.\nDuring the early 1950s, the State of California constructed the Hollywood Freeway through the northeast corner of Hollywood.\nThe Capitol Records Building on Vine Street, just north of Hollywood Boulevard, was built in 1956. The Hollywood Walk of Fame was created in 1958 as a tribute to artists and other significant contributors to the entertainment industry. The official opening was on February 8, 1960.\nThe Hollywood Boulevard Commercial and Entertainment District was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.\nIn June 1999, the Hollywood extension of the Los Angeles Metro Rail Red Line subway opened from Downtown Los Angeles to the San Fernando Valley, with stops along Hollywood Boulevard at Western Avenue (Hollywood\/Western Metro station), Vine Street (Hollywood\/Vine Metro station), and Highland Avenue (Hollywood\/Highland Metro station).\nThe Dolby Theatre, which opened in 2001 as the Kodak Theatre at the Hollywood & Highland Center mall, is the site of the annual Academy Awards programs. The mall is located where the Hollywood Hotel once stood.\n\nRevitalization\nAfter the neighborhood underwent years of serious decline in the 1980s, with crime, drugs and increasing poverty among some residents, many landmarks were threatened with demolition. Columbia Square, at the northwest corner of Sunset Boulevard and Gower Street, is part of the ongoing rebirth of Hollywood. The Art Deco-style studio complex, completed in 1938, was once the Hollywood headquarters for CBS. It became home to a new generation of broadcasters when cable television networks MTV, Comedy Central, BET and Spike TV consolidated their offices there in 2014 as part of a $420 million office, residential and retail complex.\nSince 2000, Hollywood has been increasingly gentrified due to revitalization by private enterprise and public planners. Over 1,200 hotel rooms have been added in Hollywood area between 2001 and 2016. Four thousand new apartments and over thirty low to mid-rise development projects were approved in 2019.\n\nSecession movement\nIn 2002, some Hollywood voters began a campaign for the area to secede from Los Angeles and become a separate municipality. In June of that year, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors placed secession referendums for both Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley on the ballot. To pass, they required the approval of a majority of voters in the proposed new municipality as well as a majority of voters in all of Los Angeles. In the November election, both measures failed by wide margins in the citywide vote.\n\nGeography\nAccording to the Mapping L.A. project of The Los Angeles Times, Hollywood is flanked by Hollywood Hills to the north, Los Feliz to the northeast, East Hollywood or Virgil Village to the east, Larchmont and Hancock Park to the south, Fairfax to the southwest, West Hollywood to the west, and Hollywood Hills West to the northwest.\nStreet limits of the Hollywood neighborhood are: north, Hollywood Boulevard from La Brea Avenue to the east boundary of Wattles Garden Park and Franklin Avenue between Bonita and Western avenues; east, Western Avenue; south, Melrose Avenue, and west, La Brea Avenue or the West Hollywood city line.\nIn 1918, H. J. Whitley commissioned architect A. S. Barnes to design Whitley Heights as a Mediterranean-style village on the hills above Hollywood Boulevard. It became the first celebrity community.\nOther areas within Hollywood are Franklin Village, Little Armenia, Spaulding Square, Thai Town, and Yucca Corridor.\n\nFailed trademarking attempt\nIn 1994, Hollywood, Alabama, and ten other towns named Hollywood successfully fought an attempt by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce to trademark the name and force same-named communities to pay royalties to it.\n\nClimate\nLike the rest of Los Angeles, Hollywood has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa) or dry-summer subtropical climate. Winters are typically mild and with light rain, but there are still plenty of warm, sunny days in the winter, as well. Summers are hot, sunny and dry, with virtually no rain falling between April and October; while summer days can be warm, they are considerably cooler than in the San Fernando Valley. Spring and fall are generally warm, sunny, and pleasant. Santa Ana winds typically occur during the fall and winter months, although they can occur during any month; Santa Ana winds bring heavy winds, higher temperatures and lower humidity levels, which increases the risk of wildfires, especially in dry years. Smog can sometimes occur during the summer months. May and June can be foggy and cloudy in Hollywood, a phenomenon known by southern California residents as \"May Gray\" or \"June Gloom\".\nThe all-time record high temperature in Hollywood is 112 \u00b0F (44 \u00b0C) on June 26, 1990, and the all-time record low temperature is 24 \u00b0F (\u22124 \u00b0C) on both December 8, 1978, and December 23, 1990.\n\nDemographics\nThe 2000 U.S. census counted 77,818 residents in the 3.51-square-mile (9.1 km2) Hollywood neighborhood\u2014an average of 22,193 people per square mile (8,569 people\/km2), the seventh-densest neighborhood in all of Los Angeles County. In 2008 the city estimated that the population had increased to 85,489. The median age for residents was 31, about the city's average.\nHollywood was said to be \"highly diverse\" when compared to the city at large. The ethnic breakdown in 2000 was 42.2% Latino or Hispanic, 41% Non-Hispanic White, 7.1% Asian, 5.2% black, and 4.5% other. Mexico (21.3%) and Guatemala (13%) were the most common places of birth for the 53.8% of the residents who were born abroad, a figure that was considered high for the city as a whole.\nThe median household income in 2008 was $33,694, considered low for Los Angeles. The average household size of 2.1 people was also lower than the city norm. Renters occupied 92.4% of the housing units, and home- or apartment owners the rest.\nThe percentages of never-married men (55.1%), never-married women (39.8%) and widows (9.6%) were among the county's highest. There were 2,640 families headed by single parents, about average for Los Angeles.\nIn 2000, there were 2,828 military veterans, or 4.5%, a low rate for the city as a whole.\nThese were the ten neighborhoods or cities in Los Angeles County with the highest population densities, according to the 2000 census, with the population per square mile:\n\nHomelessness\nIn 2022, there were 1,374 homeless individuals in Hollywood.\n\nRadio and television\nKNX was the last radio station to broadcast from Hollywood before it left CBS Columbia Square for a studio in the Miracle Mile in 2005.\nOn January 22, 1947, the first commercial television station west of the Mississippi River, KTLA, began operating in Hollywood. In December of that year, The Public Prosecutor became the first network television series to be filmed in Hollywood. Television stations KTLA and KCET, both on Sunset Boulevard, are the last broadcasters (television or radio) with Hollywood addresses, but KCET has since sold its studios to the Church of Scientology on Sunset, and plans to move to another location. KNBC moved in 1962 from the former NBC Radio City Studios at the northeast corner of Sunset Boulevard and Vine Street to NBC Studios in Burbank. KTTV moved in 1996 from its former home at Metromedia Square on Sunset Boulevard to West Los Angeles, and KCOP left its home on La Brea Avenue to join KTTV at the modern-day Fox Television Center. KCBS-TV and KCAL-TV moved from their longtime home at CBS Columbia Square on Sunset Boulevard to a new facility at CBS Studio Center in Studio City.\n\nGovernment\nAs a neighborhood within the Los Angeles city limits, Hollywood does not have its own municipal government. A person was appointed by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce to serve as an honorary \"Mayor of Hollywood\" for ceremonial purposes. Johnny Grant held this position from 1980 until his death on January 9, 2008.\n\nEmergency services\nThe Los Angeles Police Department is responsible for police services.

Neighborhood Councils cast advisory votes on such issues as zoning, planning, and other community issues. The council members are voted in by stakeholders, generally defined as anyone living, working, owning property, or belonging to an organization within the boundaries of the council.\n\nEducation\nHollywood residents aged 25 and older holding a four-year degree amounted to 28% of the population in 2000, about the same as in the county at large.\n\nPublic libraries\nThe Will and Ariel Durant Branch, John C.

It runs through the Hollywood, East Hollywood, Little Armenia, Thai Town, and Los Feliz districts. Its western terminus is at Sunset Plaza Drive in the Hollywood Hills and its eastern terminus is at Sunset Boulevard in Los Feliz. Hollywood Boulevard is famous for running through the tourist areas in central Hollywood, including attractions such as the Hollywood Walk of Fame and the Ovation Hollywood shopping and entertainment complex.\n\nRoute description\nHollywood Boulevard's western terminus is at Sunset Plaza Drive in the Hollywood Hills. It then runs as a winding residential street down to Laurel Canyon Boulevard. The boulevard then proceeds due east as a major thoroughfare through Hollywood and its popular tourist areas. Part of this segment has been listed in the U.S. National Register of Historic Places as part of Hollywood Boulevard Commercial and Entertainment District. The fifteen blocks between La Brea Avenue east to Gower Street is part of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The Ovation Hollywood shopping and entertainment complex, the home of the Dolby Theatre, is located at the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue. And the intersection with Vine Street was once a symbol of Hollywood itself.\nEast of Gower Street, Hollywood Boulevard crosses the Hollywood Freeway (US 101) before running through East Hollywood. The portion of the boulevard between the Hollywood Freeway and Vermont Avenue forms the northern boundary of Little Armenia, while the portion between Western Avenue and Sunset Boulevard forms part of the southern boundary of Los Feliz. Thai Town is centered along the six blocks of Hollywood Boulevard between Western and Normandie Avenues. After crossing Vermont Avenue, Hollywood Boulevard heads southeast to its eastern terminus at Sunset Boulevard.\nThree B (Red) Line Metro Rail stations are located on Hollywood Boulevard: Hollywood\/Highland station, Hollywood\/Vine station, and Hollywood\/Western station.\n\nHistory\n1890s to 1910\nPart of today's Hollywood Boulevard was called Prospect Avenue, a dusty road that ran through Hollywood towards the neighboring city of Los Angeles. In December 1899, a new railroad construction began to connect Hollywood with Los Angeles in a project that was led by Peter Beveridge, H.J. Whitley, and Griffith J. Griffith.\nIn May 1900, the railroad connecting Hollywood and Los Angeles was completed, and another one was under construction. In 1901, the Town of Hollywood opened the new macadamized road surface with electric railway that ran down its center between Laurel Canyon and Western. Eventually, the road was widened from 20 feet wide to almost 100 feet wide in some areas.\nIn 1903, Hollywood became a municipality, and Prospect Avenue became sometimes called as the Boulevard of Hollywood, albeit unofficially.\nIn 1910, the town of Hollywood was incorporated into Los Angeles, and Prospect Avenue was officially renamed Hollywood Boulevard.\n\n1920s\nIn the early 1920s, real estate developer Charles E. Toberman (the \"Father of Hollywood\") envisioned a thriving Hollywood theater district. Toberman was involved in 36 real estate development projects while building the Max Factor Salon, Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel and the Hollywood Masonic Temple. He partnered with Sid Grauman, and they opened the three themed theaters: Egyptian, El Capitan (\"The Captain\") (1926), and Chinese.\n\nRegional shopping district\nStarting around 1920, the boulevard and adjacent streets became a major regional shopping district, both for everyday needs and appliances, but increasingly also for high-end clothing and accessories, in part because of the nearby film studios. Chains that opened includes Schwab's in 1921, Mullen & Bluett in 1922, I. Magnin in 1923, Myer Siegel in 1925, F. W. Grand and Newberry's (dime stores) in 1926\u20138, and Roos Brothers in 1929. The independent Robertson's department store, at 46,000 square feet (4,300 m2) and 4 stories tall, opened in 1923. In 1922, stock was sold to finance construction of a much larger department store at Hollywood and Vine, originally to have been a Boadway Bros. When Boadway's went out of business the next year, B. H. Dyas, a Downtown Los Angeles\u2013based department store, opened in the 130,000-square-foot (12,000 m2) building in March 1928, then sold their lease to The Broadway in 1931 \u2013 the building still a landmark today, known as the Broadway Hollywood Building. By 1930 the shopping district consisted of over 300 stores.  The area would later face competition from areas along Wilshire Boulevard: the easternmost around Bullocks Wilshire which opened in 1929, second the Miracle Mile, and finally, the shopping district of Beverly Hills, where Saks Fifth Avenue opened a store in 1938.\n\nMap of businesses in the shopping district at its peak c.1925\u20138\nThe following diagram, based on an artistic map by the Hollywood Boulevard Association, and on newspaper advertisements shows the major businesses along Hollywood Boulevard, from the intersection with Vine Street to the intersection with La Brea Avenue, in 1927 or 1928. There are a few relevant notes about major buildings added after 1928. Numbers from 6100\u20137200 are addresses on Hollywood Boulevard. Dates indicate years of opening, except dates with an asterisk indicate that the establishment was in operation that year according to the source document consulted.\n\n1940s\u20131960s\nIn 1946, Gene Autry, while riding his horse in the Hollywood Christmas Parade \u2014 which passes down Hollywood Boulevard each year on the Sunday after Thanksgiving \u2014 heard young parade watchers yelling, \"Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus!\" and was inspired to write \"Here Comes Santa Claus\" with Oakley Haldeman.\nIn 1958, the Hollywood Walk of Fame, which runs from La Brea Avenue east to Gower Street (and an additional three blocks on Vine Street), was created as a tribute to artists working in the entertainment industry.\n\nDecline\nIn the 1970s, the street became very seedy and was frequented by many odd characters as shown in pictures by photographer Ave Pildas.\n\nRevitalization\nIn 1984, a portion of Hollywood Boulevard was listed in the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Hollywood Boulevard Commercial and Entertainment District.\nIn 1992, the street was paved with glittery asphalt between Vine Street and La Brea Boulevard.\nThe El Capitan Theatre was refurbished in 1991 then damaged in the 1994 Northridge earthquake.

A light rail extension station is proposed at the Hollywood Blvd. and Highland Ave. intersection connection the boulevard with West Hollywood, Central LA and LAX.\nAn anti-cruising ordinance prohibits driving on parts of the boulevard more than twice in four hours.\nBeginning in 1995, then Los Angeles City Council member Jackie Goldberg initiated efforts to clean up Hollywood Boulevard and reverse its decades-long slide into disrepute. Central to these efforts was the construction of the Hollywood and Highland Center and adjacent Dolby Theatre (originally known as the Kodak Theatre) in 2001.\nIn the summer of 2005, the city made revamping plans on Hollywood Boulevard for future tourists. The three-part plan was to exchange the original streetlights with red stars into two-headed old-fashioned streetlights, put in new palm trees, and put in new stoplights. The renovations were completed in late 2005.\nIn the few years leading up to 2007, more than $2 billion was spent on projects in the neighborhood, including mixed-use retail and apartment complexes and new schools and museums.\n\nIn 2021, the Vogue Theatre, on Hollywood Boulevard, at Las Palmas, reopened as the Vogue Multicultural Museum.\nRenovations of the Hollywood and Highland Center began in 2020. The renovated complex was renamed Ovation Hollywood in 2022.\nIn 2022, for the return of the LA Pride parade to the boulevard, the city installed multi colored lighting to more than 100 trees to illuminate for special events.\n\nHeart of Hollywood \/ Walk of Fame Master Plan\nAdvocates promote the idea of closing Hollywood Boulevard to traffic and create a Pedestrian zone from La Brea Avenue to Highland Avenue citing an increase in pedestrian traffic including tourism, weekly movie premiers and award shows closures, including 10 days for the Academy Award ceremony at the Dolby Theatre. Similar to other cities in the US, like Third Street Promenade, Fremont Street in Las Vegas, Market St. in San Francisco or the closure in Times Squares Pedestrian Plaza's created in 2015.\nIn June 2019, The City of Los Angeles commissioned Gensler architects to provide a master plan for a $4 million renovation to improve and \"update the streetscape concept\" for the Walk of Fame between the Pantages Theater (Gower Avenue) at the east and The Emerson Theatre (La Brea Avenue) at the west end of the boulevard. Los Angeles City Councilmember Mitch O'Farrell released the draft master plan designed by Gensler and Studio-MLA in January 2020. The city's Bureau of Engineers proposed a three phase approach to implement the changes. This included adding bike lanes, new landscaping, removing lanes of car traffic, sidewalk widening by removing street parking and art-deco designed street pavers to beautify the boulevard. They also proposed a street mechanism to able to temporarily close the boulevard on pedestrian high capacity days or events where a street closure was approved. Creating public plazas and car free zones. Phase three would disallow east-west travel thru the boulevard but still allow north-south travel along its major intersections, Highland Avenue, Cahuanga Boulevard and Vine Street. The approved phase one was completed and removed parking lanes between Orange Drive and Gower Street in 2022. New district council member for Hollywood, Hugo Soto-Martinez continued with the revitalization plan after defeating O'Farrell in the 2022 election cycle. A motion was filed June 30, 2023 to implement a tax district to continue funding the master plans phase two and three.\nIn early March 2024, council member Hugo Soto-Martinez announced \"Access to Hollywood\" plan.

The theater was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016.  The Palladium was designated Los Angeles Historic Cultural Monument No. 1130 on September 28, 2016.\n\nHistory\nLos Angeles Times publisher Norman Chandler funded the construction of the art deco Hollywood Palladium at a cost of $1.6 million in 1940. It was built where the original Paramount lot once stood between Argyle and El Centro avenues, and was operated by film producer Maurice Cohen. The dance hall was designed by Gordon Kaufmann, architect of the Greystone Mansion, the Los Angeles Times Building and the Santa Anita Racetrack in Arcadia. He was also the architect for the Hoover Dam and early Caltech dorms.\nThe ballroom opened on October 31, 1940 with a dance featuring Tommy Dorsey and his Orchestra and band vocalist Frank Sinatra. It had six bars serving liquor and two more serving soft drinks and a $1 cover charge and a $3 charge for dinner.\nDuring World War II, the Palladium hosted radio broadcasts featuring Betty Grable greeting servicemens' song requests. Big Band acts began losing popularity in the 1950s, causing the Palladium to hold charity balls, political events, auto shows, and rock concerts. In 1961, it became the home of the long-running Lawrence Welk Show.\nFrom 1955 to 1976, the venue was the scene of Latin Music Orchestras for ragers sponsored by radio personality Chico Sesma titled Latin Holidays, featuring childhood friend  Ray Vasquez Recording Artist, Lead Vocalist and Trombonist.

It was also used for Hollywood celebrity parties.\n\nRenovation and reopening\nIn 2007, the owners agreed to a long-term lease to operate, manage and exclusively book the Hollywood Palladium with Live Nation, a Los Angeles-based company.\nThe Palladium reopened with a Jay-Z concert on October 15, 2008 after a year-long, multimillion-dollar renovation by Live Nation. The renovation included an overhaul of the venue's interior and exterior, a new dance floor, expanded concessions, upgraded restrooms and improvements to the stage infrastructure. Jay-Z performed for nearly an hour-and-half, backed by an eight-piece band and DJ AM, who played his first show after surviving a plane crash in South Carolina. The Hollywood Palladium was also used as the memorial service site for DJ AM on September 3, 2009.\nFor the 2008\u20132009 season, a yearlong table for four cost $30,000.\n\nResidential expansion\nThe Los Angeles City Council approved an expansion of the Palladium property parking lot in March 2016. The plan consists of two 28-story residential towers that surrounds the Palladium, standing 350 feet (110 m) tall and creating 731 condominiums, 24,000-square-foot (2,200 m2) of store-front retail space, and a below grade-parking garage. The Towers were designed by Stanley Saitowits of Natoma Architects for developer Crescent Heights. The L-shaped design resembles and echoes the design of the Palladium.\nThe local AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) filed a lawsuit in 2016 citing over development and improper approval process. One of many local lawsuits filed by AHF president Michael Weinstein. In August 2018, the district court ruled all steps were taken during EIR\/DEIR. The AHF filed an appeal. The AHF lost the appeal in November 2019 and Crescent Heights plans to proceed.\n\nIn popular culture\nThe Hollywood Palladium has been featured in many films and television productions over the years:\n\nThe Hollywood Palladium exterior, with its iconic Art Deco fa\u00e7ade, served as the fictional sound stage for Aaron Sorkin's 2006-2007 ensemble television drama Studio 60 On The Sunset Strip.\nThe Day of the Locust (1975).\nThe last scene of the series finale of Adam-12 was filmed at the Palladium in 1975.

The Hollywood Walk of Fame is centered on the intersection.\n\nHistory\nThe area was a lemon grove until 1903, when Daeida Beveridge allowed one corner of the dirt intersection on her property to be used for the Hollywood Memorial Church. The streets were renamed in 1910, when the city of Hollywood was annexed into Los Angeles. \nBeginning in the 1920s, during the Golden Age of Hollywood, the area began to see an influx of money and influence as movie and music businesses moved to the district, turning the local farms and orchards into movie backlots. Hollywood and Vine was the second busiest intersection in the city, after Wilshire Boulevard and Western Avenue.\nIn the 1930s, radio station KFWB spoke of \"broadcasting live from Hollywood and Vine,\" and newspaper columnists Hedda Hopper and Jimmie Fidler regularly touted the intersection's mystique.\nIn 1958, the intersection became the crossing point of the newly installed t-shaped Hollywood Walk of Fame. Later Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins, the astronauts of the first lunar landing mission Apollo 11, were awarded television stars for coverage of the mission, and given the places of honor at all four corners of Hollywood and Vine.\nBy the 1960s, however, many studios and broadcasters had moved onto more upscale areas, and the area fell into disrepair and disrepute, with many abandoned stores and offices, and the streets themselves, claimed by squatters and panhandlers. It took several decades for redevelopment to take hold, and visitors looking for Hollywood dreams were often taken aback by the area's contrast with shinier tourist meccas.\n\nThe Hollywood\/Vine subway station opened in 1999, and led to more sustained and serious redevelopment in the area. On May 29, 2003, Hollywood and Vine was named \"Bob Hope Square\" to commemorate Hope's 100th birthday.\nIn urban folklore, many of the local buildings are considered to be part of \"Haunted Hollywood\", home to the ghosts of celebrities (and less stellar residents) of Hollywood's legendary past. The intersection has been mentioned or alluded to in dozens of songs, films, video games, music videos and other popular media, often as a symbol of Hollywood's lure as a destination for dreamers, or for its decadence and disappointments.\n\nHistoric buildings\nHollywood and Vine's first building, located on the intersection's sourtheast corner, was the Hollywood Memorial Church, constructed in 1903. It was later torn down to make way for the intersection's first high rise, the 12-story Taft Building, built in 1923. The Taft Building was built in the Renaissance Revival style for A.Z. Taft Jr. by Walker & Eisen. In Hollywood's golden age, every studio as well as Charlie Chaplin, Will Rogers, and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences had offices in the building. To the south of the Taft Building is the Spanish Colonial Revival Herman Building and south of that was the complementary-designed Hollywood Brown Derby, the latter of which was demolished in 1994. To the east of the Taft Building was the Ch\u00e2teauesque Gilbert Books Building, which was demolished to make way for the W Hollywood Hotel and Residences.\nOn the northeast corner, the Equitable Building of Hollywood was designed by Aleck Curlett, built in 1929, and expanded in 1931. Originally home to numerous talent and advertising agencies, it was converted to a condominium in 2007. East of the Equitable Building is the Art Deco Hollywood Pantages Theatre, designed by B. Marcus Priteca and built as a movie palace in 1930, then converted to a live theater in the 1977. North of the Equitable Building is the Welton Becket designed, Googie-styled Capitol Records Building. Built in 1956, the Capitol Records Building is the world's first circular office building and was home to the first record label location on the west coast of the United States.\nOn the northwest corner, the Laemmle Building was built in 1932 by Richard Neutra for Carl Laemmle, head of Universal Pictures. The original design was not built because of the 1929 stock market crash, and the building was significantly altered many times. The building was gutted by fire in April 2008 and razed six months later. To the west of the former Laemmle Building is the former site of Sardi's Diner and is now home to the Cave Theater. West of that is the Vine Theatre. To the north of the former Laemmle Building is a Spanish Colonial style Hollywood Playhouse, opened on January 24, 1927 designed by H. L. Gogerty and Carl Jules Weyl. The building's name has changed many times over the 20th century, but was known as the Hollywood Palace for many years before its most recent renaming.\nOn the southwest corner, the Dyas Building was built in 1927 by Frederick Rice Dorn. From 1931 to 1982, the building housed The Broadway-Hollywood department store, and in 2007, the building converted to multi-family residential, ground-floor commercial. The Dyas Building has two annexes, one to the south of the building and the other to the west, that were built in the late 1930s. South of the building is the Hollywood Plaza Hotel, built by Walker & Eisen in 1924 and at one point home to silent film star Clara Bow's \"It Cafe\".\n\nRedevelopment and urbanization\nA number of high-profile projects have attempted to restore the lost luster of the area, most notably the $600 million W Hollywood Hotel and Residences, which opened in 2010. Other large projects include a $50-million conversion of the Equitable Building and $70-million conversion of the Dyas Building into condominiums.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nHollywood Entertainment District\nHollywood Boulevard - myth & reality\nHistoric Resources Group - Historic LA Project","106":"Holmby Hills is a neighborhood on the Westside of Los Angeles, California, United States.\nThe neighborhood was developed in the early twentieth century by the Janss Investment Company, which developed the rest of Westwood, Los Angeles as well as other \"LA\"  neighborhoods. With the expansion of Sunset Boulevard, Holmby Hills was split into northern and southern sections, each lying within a different community plan area designated by the City of Los Angeles: The portion south of Sunset Boulevard extends south to Club View Dr and east to Beverly Glen Boulevard and west of the Los Angeles Country Club; it is located within the Westwood Community Plan Area, but certain characteristics such as the absence of sidewalks and the presence of historic street lamps that are unique to Holmby Hills help to distinguish it from the remainder of Westwood. The portion north of Sunset is the area east of Beverly Glen Boulevard and west of the city limits of Beverly Hills, with Greendale Drive and Brooklawn Drive as its northernmost streets; it is located within the Bel Air\u2013Beverly Crest Community Plan Area, though it is historically distinct from the neighborhoods of both Bel Air and Beverly Crest, as it was developed concurrently with Westwood.\n\nGeography\nHolmby Hills, Bel Air, and Beverly Hills form the \"Platinum Triangle\" of Los Angeles. It is bordered by the city of Beverly Hills on the east, Wilshire Boulevard on the south, Westwood on the west, and Bel Air on the north.\nIn an effort to decrease traffic in the neighborhood, speed bumps have been installed on several key streets.\n\nHistory\nThe first European on the land that present-day Holmby Hills, Bel Air, Westwood, and UCLA now occupy was the Spanish soldier Maximo Alanis, who was the grantee of the 4,438-acre (18 km2) Rancho San Jose de Buenos Ayres from a Mexican land grant issued by Alta California Governor Manuel Micheltorena in 1843.\nIn 1859, he sold it to Benjamin Davis Wilson, of early Pasadena development, the second Mayor of Los Angeles, and namesake for Mount Wilson in the San Gabriel Mountains. In 1884, Wilson sold Rancho San Jose de Buenos Ayres, at 2,000 acres (8 km2), to the nephew of leading pioneer William Wolfskill, businessman John W. Wolfskill, son of Mathus (Mathius) Wolfskill, William's younger brother. He paid $10 an acre and built a ranch house, near the present-day Mormon Los Angeles Temple.\nThe development of Holmby Hills began when Arthur Letts Sr., purchased 400 acres (1.6 km2) of the original Wolfskill ranch at $100 an acre. He called the development \"Holmby Hills,\" which was loosely derived from the name of his birthplace, a small hamlet in England called Holdenby, and it was also the name of his estate in Hollywood. Letts died suddenly in 1923, before he could realize his vision. His son-in-law, Harold Janss, took over the project.\nZoning for the community, which straddles Sunset Boulevard, was designed to accommodate lot sizes up to 4 acres (16,000 m2). The streets were named after places in Great Britain: Devon Avenue after Devon, the county in southwestern England; Charing Cross Road after Charing Cross junction in London; Conway Avenue after Conwy in Wales, etc. In the 1920s, English-style streetlamps were added specifically for the neighborhood. After the Wall Street Crash of 1929, grand mansions were constructed.\nIn 2012, residents tried to be annexed into the city of Beverly Hills, to make sure their potholes would be repaired, but this was rejected by John A. Mirisch, then Beverly Hills city councillor and later mayor.\nAccording to the Holmby Hills Homeowners Association website: \"In the 1920s, Sunset Boulevard was a two-lane country road, known as Beverly Boulevard. It was renamed when it was opened through to the Pacific Ocean. When Sunset Boulevard was expanded into a four-lane thoroughfare, Holmby Hills was, for all practical purposes, split into north and south sections.\" The northern section is served by the Holmby Hills Homeowners Association, while the southern section is served by the Holmby Westwood Property Owners Association, which it shares with the rest of the northern Westwood area east of UCLA. However, \"[i]n 2013, the Holmby Hills Homeowners Association Board has decided to reach out to the homeowners south of Sunset (and east of Beverly Glen) to grow the Association with new members also residing in Holmby Hills having similar interests.\"\nIn 2000, Holmby Hills was ranked by Higley 1000 as the richest urban neighborhood in the United States. The 2017 report, however, redrew and expanded the neighborhood's boundaries, causing its ranking to slip.\n\nCommunity\nThe neighborhood is home to two parks: Holmby Park and De Neve Square Park. The former, Holmby Park, includes two playgrounds, a nine-hole putting green called the Armand Hammer Golf Course, and a classic lawn bowling, home to the Holmby Park Lawn Bowling Club started in 1927. It is located next to the Los Angeles Country Club.\nThe Frederick R. Weisman Art Foundation, an art gallery named after Frederick R. Weisman, is located on North Carolwood Street. It includes works by many noted artists, including impressionists, post impressionist, surrealist, and many more, up through today.\n\nEducation\nPrimary and secondary schools\nPublic schools\nResidents are zoned to the following Los Angeles Unified School District schools: Warner Avenue Elementary School, Emerson Middle School, and University High School.\n\nColleges and universities\nHolmby Hills is several blocks east of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).\n\nPrivate schools\nThe only school located within Holmby Hills is the Middle School (grades 7\u20139) component of the independent Harvard-Westlake School. The campus was originally occupied by Westlake School for Girls, which moved from its original site near downtown L.A. to the Holmby Hills campus in 1927. Harvard-Westlake was created in 1989 when Westlake merged with the Harvard School for Boys.\n\nNotable people\nNicolas Berggruen purchased a 20,000 square-foot home in 2017\nThe son of Arthur Letts (1862\u20131923) lived in a mansion designed by architect Arthur Rolland Kelly located at 10236 Charing Cross Road.

The street was named after railroad magnate Henry E. Huntington. It also served as one of the only thoroughfares between Los Angeles and Pasadena in the early 1900s.  Portions of Huntington Drive were part of U.S. Route 66. The road has a wide median that was originally one of the lines of the Pacific Electric Railway, the Monrovia\u2013Glendora Line.\n\nRoute Description\nHuntington Drive begins at Soto Street in Lincoln Heights.  South of Soto Street the road is Mission Road. The street heads north but quickly heads northeast through El Sereno, Los Angeles and then into South Pasadena, California. In South Pasadena, Huntington Drive intersects with Fair Oaks Avenue.  The portion from Soto Street to Fair Oaks was part of the original routing for US 66. Past South Pasadena, Huntington continues through San Marino, California and passes just south of the Huntington Library. The road then goes through East San Gabriel, California and then Arcadia, California where it merges with Colorado Boulevard near Santa Anita Park.  At this junction, Huntington Drive becomes another portion of US 66, passing through Monrovia, California and Duarte, California until Irwindale where it continues as Foothill Boulevard.\n\nHistory\nHuntington Drive was the major route between Los Angeles and Pasadena in the early 1900s until the opening of the Arroyo Seco Parkway. The median contained the Monrovia\u2013Glendora Line of the Pacific Electric Railway which was owned by the street's namesake, Henry Huntington.  When the line discontinued service in 1951, the large median became a large lawn with trees, and the roadways either side of the median were reconfigured from bidirectional traffic to one-way traffic.  In the 1930s, traveling on Huntington would have drove you by the Cawston Ostrich Farm in South Pasadena and in Monrovia a hot dog stand, the first restaurant opened by the McDonald brothers who would later create the fast-food restaurant McDonald's. Huntington Drive between Soto Street and Fair Oaks Avenue was the original alignment of US 66 from 1926 until around 1936 when it was re-routed to eventually the Arroyo Seco Parkway.  Between Colorado Boulevard east to the Irwindale city limit it was signed as US 66 until it was decommissioned. The city of Duarte stenciled Route 66 logos onto the street in 2017 to commemorate the city's 60th anniversary.\n\nMajor Intersections\nMission Road\/Soto Street\nMain Street\nFair Oaks Avenue\nGarfield Avenue\nAtlantic Boulevard\nRosemead Boulevard (State Route 19)\nColorado Boulevard\nInterstate 210\nInterstate 605\n\nSee also\nList of streets in the San Gabriel Valley\n\n\n== References ==","110":"The Andaz West Hollywood is a 239-room Hyatt hotel located at 8401 Sunset Boulevard, West Hollywood, California (at Kings Road).\n\nHistory\nThe hotel was opened in 1963 by Gene Autry as Gene Autry's Hotel Continental.

It was originally released on his 1983 album Trouble in Paradise. The song is about Los Angeles, California, and its hook is its title, repeated, each time followed by an enthusiastic crowd cheering, \"We love it!\"\n\nWriting and recording\nFollowing the release of his sixth album Born Again (1979), Newman procrastinated writing songs for a follow-up album, and spent a good portion of the next four years relaxing at home with his family. Newman jokingly noted that because he often lounged by the pool, the gardener had to water around him. To counter this lackadaisical lifestyle, Newman rented a recording studio in Los Angeles in 1983, which did not have any telephones to distract him. In this studio Newman recorded a song called \"Something to Sing About\", in which the narrator arrogantly boasts about the suburban opulence around him. Album producer Lenny Waronker disliked \"Something to Sing About\" and opted not to include it on the singer's upcoming album.\nAlthough \"Something to Sing About\" was not used, the song's message of delusion and arrogance served as an inspiration for \"I Love L.A.\" Another source of inspiration came from a conversation Newman had with Eagles drummer Don Henley while on an airplane. Henley told him that he could no longer afford to charter Learjets, to which Newman sarcastically responded: \"Jesus that's tough...you can't live on a million a year anymore\". During the same flight, Henley suggested Newman should write a song about Los Angeles, as he was a native of the city. This conversation, as well as \"Something to Sing About\", not only served as the inspiration for \"I Love L.A.\", but also the themes of hedonism and disillusion found in the song's parent album Trouble in Paradise.\n\"I Love L.A.\" and the rest of the songs from Trouble in Paradise were recorded at Warner Bros. Recording Studios in Hollywood, with producers Waronker and Russ Titelman. Mark Linett served as the audio and mixing engineer, while Bobby Hata was the audio master. Several members of the rock band Toto provided groove instrumentation, and Waddy Wachtel played the rhythm guitar.\n\nComposition\nAllMusic's Matthew Greenwald believes \"I Love L.A.\" is Newman's only attempt at writing an \"anthem\", as the song features an energetic and buoyant melody not commonly found in the singer's previous music. \"I Love L.A.\" begins with a soft opening verse, which features electric piano and saxophone instrumentation. The opening verse borrows the melody of Rodgers and Hart's 1937 song \"The Lady Is a Tramp\". Newman begins this verse by deriding New York City as a place where \"people dressed like monkeys\", and saying Chicago should be left to the \"Eskimos\". The soft verse then transitions to a more upbeat, pop rock driven melody, influenced by the sound of the Beach Boys. This influence is evidenced when Newman name-drops the band in the lyrics, as well as alluding to their 1963 song \"Surfin' U.S.A.\"\n\nFollowing the musical shift, the lyrics now depict Newman driving down Imperial Highway in Los Angeles with a \"big nasty redhead\" at his side. Newman sings about rolling down the windows and pulling back the top of his convertible as he feels the Santa Ana winds brush against him. He proceeds to name-drop several regions in Los Angeles such as South Bay, the Valley, and the Westside, and how everyone in these regions are happy because the sun is shining. The chorus features Newman singing the phrase \"I love L.A.\" several times, while Christine McVie and Lindsey Buckingham of the band Fleetwood Mac respond each time with \"We love it\".\nAfter the first chorus, the music temporarily shifts to a new section that removes the guitar and heavily emphasizes the synthesizer, before returning to its original melody. Newman proceeds to point out various objects and people, such as Matterhorn Bobsleds, palm trees, homeless people, and beautiful California women. Newman then name-drops several famous streets in Los Angeles: Century Boulevard, Victory Boulevard, Santa Monica Boulevard, and the Sixth Street Viaduct. Each time he says the name of a road, McVie and Buckingham respond with the phrase \"We love it\". A guitar solo (played by Toto's Steve Lukather) follows, before the song ends with the chorus.\n\nLyrical analysis\nNewman is well known for his sardonic lyrics, as he would often write a song from a character's perspective and mock the first-person character and others like them. This style of songwriting can be seen in some of Newman's other songs, such as the slaveholder's perspective in \"Sail Away\" (1972), and the redneck perspective in \"Rednecks\" (1974). Despite its lively sound, \"I Love L.A.\" also includes these sardonic lyrics, specifically about the shallow and dark aspects of Los Angeles. When Newman is listing off various sites in Los Angeles, Newman is discussing how residents will talk about the lavish excess of the city (palm trees, beautiful women) in an attempt to hide the squalor (a homeless man begging for money).\nNicholas Pell of LA Weekly noted how there were other parts of the song that serve as subtle insults to the city. He noted the Santa Ana winds in reality are very unpleasant, as the strong winds blow palm leaves and furniture around, and often bring hot dry weather. Pell believes the four streets listed at the end of the song were the four \"must avoid\" streets of 1983, due to gang violence and urban neglect. Pell ultimately described \"I Love L.A.\" as a \"paean to the moral weakness and intellectual vapidity\" of Los Angeles. When journalist Timothy White asked whether or not \"I Love L.A.\" was written as an insult to Los Angeles, Newman responded by saying he felt the lyrics were ambiguous. In a separate interview, Newman confessed an affection for his native city despite its imperfections: \"There's some kind of ignorance L.A. has that I'm proud of. The open car and the redhead, the Beach Boys... that sounds really good to me.\"\n\nRelease and reception\n\"I Love L.A.\" was released in 1983 as the lead single from Trouble in Paradise. At first, the single was considered a flop, as it failed to make the Billboard Hot 100, and was not distributed to retailers outside of the West Coast of the United States. The song did, however, reach #110 on Billboard's Bubbling Under chart during April 1983.\nThe following year, Los Angeles hosted the Summer Olympics, and the company Nike ran an ambush marketing campaign during the event. The campaign included a commercial featuring Newman singing \"I Love L.A.\" while Olympic athletes Mary Decker and Carl Lewis ran and jumped wearing Nike gear. The commercial played throughout the Olympics, and as a result, \"I Love L.A.\" received worldwide exposure. It became one of the best-selling songs in Los Angeles, as citizens of Los Angeles saw the song as a celebration of their city.\n\nCredits and personnel\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of Trouble in Paradise.\n\nCovers and parodies\nIn 1998, the rock group Jake Trout and the Flounders \u2013 consisting of professional golfers Payne Stewart, Peter Jacobsen and Larry Rinker \u2013 recorded a golf-themed parody of the song titled \"I Love to Play\", for their album of the same name.\nIn 1985, Kris Kardashian (now Kris Jenner) covered the song with her own spin titled \"I Love My Friends\". Her daughters recreated the video for her 60th birthday in 2015.\n\nIn popular culture\n\"I Love L.A.\" has been used in many feature films. The song was the first and the last music video aired on Cable Music Channel. The song was also used in some of the network's IDs and commercial promos.\n\"I Love L.A.\" is played following major sporting events in Los Angeles if the home team has scored or won, notably when the Los Angeles Dodgers, Los Angeles Lakers, Los Angeles Rams, Los Angeles Kings and the Los Angeles Galaxy win, with it being the Kings' former goal song. The Dodgers adapted the title to \"We Love L.A.\" as a marketing slogan for the 2015 season, prompting Los Angeles Times writer Steve Dilbeck to quip, \"It's not 'I Love L.A.' like in the song, but we love L.A. Guess they wanted to save paying royalties to Randy Newman.\"\nThe sequence of streets in the song was parodied in the 1985 song \"Born in East L.A.\" by Cheech Marin. But instead of listing the streets sung by Randy Newman, listed are Soto Street, Brooklyn Avenue, City Terrace, and Whittier Boulevard, all streets of East Los Angeles.\nIn June 2014, as part of losing a bet on the National Hockey League Stanley Cup finals between the New York Rangers and the Los Angeles Kings with Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti, New York City mayor Bill de Blasio sang the song on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, wearing an \"I Love L.A.\" T-shirt and accompanied by disadvantaged youth from the 52nd Street Project.\n\nSee also\n\n\"Theme from New York, New York\" by Frank Sinatra\n\"I Love New York\"\n\"I Left My Heart in San Francisco\" by Tony Bennett\n\"Viva Las Vegas\" by Elvis Presley\n\"Sweet Home Chicago\"\n\"Sweet Home Alabama\"\n\n\n== References ==","112":"The International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is a numeric commercial book identifier that is intended to be unique. Publishers purchase or receive ISBNs from an affiliate of the International ISBN Agency.\nA different ISBN is assigned to each separate edition and variation of a publication, but not to a simple reprinting of an existing item. For example, an e-book, a paperback and a hardcover edition of the same book must each have a different ISBN, but an unchanged reprint of the hardcover edition keeps the same ISBN. The ISBN is ten digits long if assigned before 2007, and thirteen digits long if assigned on or after 1 January 2007. The method of assigning an ISBN is nation-specific and varies between countries, often depending on how large the publishing industry is within a country.\nThe first version of the ISBN identification format was devised in 1967, based upon the 9-digit Standard Book Numbering (SBN) created in 1966. The 10-digit ISBN format was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and was published in 1970 as international standard ISO 2108 (any 9-digit SBN can be converted to a 10-digit ISBN by prefixing it with a zero).\nPrivately published books sometimes appear without an ISBN. The International ISBN Agency sometimes assigns ISBNs to such books on its own initiative.\nA separate identifier code of a similar kind, the International Standard Serial Number (ISSN), identifies periodical publications such as magazines and newspapers. The International Standard Music Number (ISMN) covers musical scores.\n\nHistory\nThe Standard Book Number (SBN) is a commercial system using nine-digit code numbers to identify books. In 1965, British bookseller and stationers WHSmith announced plans to implement a standard numbering system for its books. They hired consultants to work on their behalf, and the system was devised by Gordon Foster, emeritus professor of statistics at Trinity College Dublin. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Technical Committee on Documentation sought to adapt the British SBN for international use. The ISBN identification format was conceived in 1967 in the United Kingdom by David Whitaker (regarded as the \"Father of the ISBN\") and in 1968 in the United States by Emery Koltay (who later became director of the U.S. ISBN agency R. R. Bowker).\nThe 10-digit ISBN format was developed by the ISO and was published in 1970 as international standard ISO 2108. The United Kingdom continued to use the nine-digit SBN code until 1974. ISO has appointed the International ISBN Agency as the registration authority for ISBN worldwide and the ISBN Standard is developed under the control of ISO Technical Committee 46\/Subcommittee 9 TC 46\/SC 9. The ISO on-line facility only refers back to 1978.\n\nAn SBN may be converted to an ISBN by prefixing the digit \"0\". For example, the second edition of Mr. J. G. Reeder Returns, published by Hodder in 1965, has \"SBN 340 01381 8\", where \"340\" indicates the publisher, \"01381\" is the serial number assigned by the publisher, and \"8\" is the check digit. By prefixing a zero, this can be converted to ISBN 0-340-01381-8; the check digit does not need to be re-calculated. Some publishers, such as Ballantine Books, would sometimes use 12-digit SBNs where the last three digits indicated the price of the book; for example, Woodstock Handmade Houses had a 12-digit Standard Book Number of 345-24223-8-595 (valid SBN: 345-24223-8, ISBN: 0-345-24223-8), and it cost US$5.95.\nSince 1 January 2007, ISBNs have contained thirteen digits, a format that is compatible with \"Bookland\" European Article Numbers, which have 13 digits.\nThe United States, with 3.9 million registered ISBNs in 2020, was by far the biggest user of the ISBN identifier in 2020, followed by the Republic of Korea (329,582), Germany (284,000), China (263,066), the UK (188,553) and Indonesia (144,793). Lifetime ISBNs registered in the United States are over 39 million as of 2020.\n\nOverview\nA separate ISBN is assigned to each edition and variation (except reprintings) of a publication. For example, an ebook, audiobook, paperback, and hardcover edition of the same book must each have a different ISBN assigned to it.:\u200a12\u200a The ISBN is thirteen digits long if assigned on or after 1 January 2007, and ten digits long if assigned before 2007. An International Standard Book Number consists of four parts (if it is a 10-digit ISBN) or five parts (for a 13-digit ISBN).\nSection 5 of the International ISBN Agency's official user manual:\u200a11\u200a describes the structure of the 13-digit ISBN, as follows:\n\nfor a 13-digit ISBN, a prefix element \u2013 a GS1 prefix: so far 978 or 979 have been made available by GS1,\nthe registration group element (language-sharing country group, individual country or territory),\nthe registrant element,\nthe publication element, and\na checksum character or check digit.\nA 13-digit ISBN can be separated into its parts (prefix element, registration group, registrant, publication and check digit), and when this is done it is customary to separate the parts with hyphens or spaces. Separating the parts (registration group, registrant, publication and check digit) of a 10-digit ISBN is also done with either hyphens or spaces. Figuring out how to correctly separate a given ISBN is complicated, because most of the parts do not use a fixed number of digits.\n\nIssuing process\nISBN issuance is country-specific, in that ISBNs are issued by the ISBN registration agency that is responsible for that country or territory regardless of the publication language. The ranges of ISBNs assigned to any particular country are based on the publishing profile of the country concerned, and so the ranges will vary depending on the number of books and the number, type, and size of publishers that are active. Some ISBN registration agencies are based in national libraries or within ministries of culture and thus may receive direct funding from the government to support their services. In other cases, the ISBN registration service is provided by organisations such as bibliographic data providers that are not government funded.\nA full directory of ISBN agencies is available on the International ISBN Agency website.

R. Bowker\n\nRegistration group element\nThe ISBN registration group element is a 1-to-5-digit number that is valid within a single prefix element (i.e. one of 978 or 979),:\u200a11\u200a and can be separated between hyphens, such as \"978-1-...\". Registration groups have primarily been allocated within the 978 prefix element. The single-digit registration groups within the 978-prefix element are: 0 or 1 for English-speaking countries; 2 for French-speaking countries; 3 for German-speaking countries; 4 for Japan; 5 for Russian-speaking countries; and 7 for People's Republic of China. Example 5-digit registration groups are 99936 and 99980, for Bhutan. The allocated registration groups are: 0\u20135, 600\u2013631, 65, 7, 80\u201394, 950\u2013989, 9910\u20139989, and 99901\u201399993. Books published in rare languages typically have longer group elements.\nWithin the 979 prefix element, the registration group 0 is reserved for compatibility with International Standard Music Numbers (ISMNs), but such material is not actually assigned an ISBN. The registration groups within prefix element 979 that have been assigned are 8 for the United States of America, 10 for France, 11 for the Republic of Korea, and 12 for Italy.\nThe original 9-digit standard book number (SBN) had no registration group identifier, but prefixing a zero to a 9-digit SBN creates a valid 10-digit ISBN.\n\nRegistrant element\nThe national ISBN agency assigns the registrant element (cf. Category:ISBN agencies) and an accompanying series of ISBNs within that registrant element to the publisher; the publisher then allocates one of the ISBNs to each of its books. In most countries, a book publisher is not legally required to assign an ISBN, although most large bookstores only handle publications that have ISBNs assigned to them.\nThe International ISBN Agency maintains the details of over one million ISBN prefixes and publishers in the Global Register of Publishers. This database is freely searchable over the internet.\nPublishers receive blocks of ISBNs, with larger blocks allotted to publishers expecting to need them; a small publisher may receive ISBNs of one or more digits for the registration group identifier, several digits for the registrant, and a single digit for the publication element. Once that block of ISBNs is used, the publisher may receive another block of ISBNs, with a different registrant element. Consequently, a publisher may have different allotted registrant elements. There also may be more than one registration group identifier used in a country. This might occur once all the registrant elements from a particular registration group have been allocated to publishers.\nBy using variable block lengths, registration agencies are able to customise the allocations of ISBNs that they make to publishers. For example, a large publisher may be given a block of ISBNs where fewer digits are allocated for the registrant element and many digits are allocated for the publication element; likewise, countries publishing many titles have few allocated digits for the registration group identifier and many for the registrant and publication elements. Here are some sample ISBN-10 codes, illustrating block length variations.\n\nEnglish-language pattern\nEnglish-language registration group elements are 0 and 1 (2 of more than 220 registration group elements). These two registration group elements are divided into registrant elements in a systematic pattern, which allows their length to be determined, as follows:\n\nCheck digits\nA check digit is a form of redundancy check used for error detection, the decimal equivalent of a binary check bit. It consists of a single digit computed from the other digits in the number. The method for the 10-digit ISBN is an extension of that for SBNs, so the two systems are compatible; an SBN prefixed with a zero (the 10-digit ISBN) will give the same check digit as the SBN without the zero. The check digit is base eleven, and can be an integer between 0 and 9, or an 'X'. The system for 13-digit ISBNs is not compatible with SBNs and will, in general, give a different check digit from the corresponding 10-digit ISBN, so does not provide the same protection against transposition. This is because the 13-digit code was required to be compatible with the EAN format, and hence could not contain the letter 'X'.\n\nISBN-10 check digits\nAccording to the 2001 edition of the International ISBN Agency's official user manual, the ISBN-10 check digit (which is the last digit of the 10-digit ISBN) must range from 0 to 10 (the symbol 'X' is used for 10), and must be such that the sum of the ten digits, each multiplied by its (integer) weight, descending from 10 to 1, is a multiple of 11. That is, if xi is the ith digit, then x10 must be chosen such that:\n\nFor example, for an ISBN-10 of 0-306-40615-2:\n\nFormally, using modular arithmetic, this is rendered\n\nIt is also true for ISBN-10s that the sum of all ten digits, each multiplied by its weight in ascending order from 1 to 10, is a multiple of 11. For this example:\n\nFormally, this is rendered\n\nThe two most common errors in handling an ISBN (e.g. when typing it or writing it down) are a single altered digit or the transposition of adjacent digits. It can be proven mathematically that all pairs of valid ISBN-10s differ in at least two digits. It can also be proven that there are no pairs of valid ISBN-10s with eight identical digits and two transposed digits (these proofs are true because the ISBN is less than eleven digits long and because 11 is a prime number). The ISBN check digit method therefore ensures that it will always be possible to detect these two most common types of error, i.e., if either of these types of error has occurred, the result will never be a valid ISBN\u2014the sum of the digits multiplied by their weights will never be a multiple of 11. However, if the error were to occur in the publishing house and remain undetected, the book would be issued with an invalid ISBN.\nIn contrast, it is possible for other types of error, such as two altered non-transposed digits, or three altered digits, to result in a valid ISBN (although it is still unlikely).\n\nISBN-10 check digit calculation\nEach of the first nine digits of the 10-digit ISBN\u2014excluding the check digit itself\u2014is multiplied by its (integer) weight, descending from 10 to 2, and the sum of these nine products found. The value of the check digit is simply the one number between 0 and 10 which, when added to this sum, means the total is a multiple of 11.\nFor example, the check digit for an ISBN-10 of 0-306-40615-? is calculated as follows:\n\nAdding 2 to 130 gives a multiple of 11 (because 132 = 12\u00d711)\u2014this is the only number between 0 and 10 which does so. Therefore, the check digit has to be 2, and the complete sequence is ISBN 0-306-40615-2. If the value of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            10\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{10}}\n  \n required to satisfy this condition is 10, then an 'X' should be used.\nAlternatively, modular arithmetic is convenient for calculating the check digit using modulus 11. The remainder of this sum when it is divided by 11 (i.e. its value modulo 11), is computed. This remainder plus the check digit must equal either 0 or 11. Therefore, the check digit is (11 minus the remainder of the sum of the products modulo 11) modulo 11. Taking the remainder modulo 11 a second time accounts for the possibility that the first remainder is 0. Without the second modulo operation, the calculation could result in a check digit value of 11 \u2212 0 = 11, which is invalid. (Strictly speaking, the first \"modulo 11\" is not needed, but it may be considered to simplify the calculation.)\nFor example, the check digit for the ISBN of 0-306-40615-? is calculated as follows:\n\nThus the check digit is 2.\nIt is possible to avoid the multiplications in a software implementation by using two accumulators. Repeatedly adding t into s computes the necessary multiples:\n\nThe modular reduction can be done once at the end, as shown above (in which case s could hold a value as large as 496, for the invalid ISBN 99999-999-9-X), or s and t could be reduced by a conditional subtract after each addition.\n\nISBN-13 check digit calculation\nAppendix 1 of the International ISBN Agency's official user manual:\u200a33\u200a describes how the 13-digit ISBN check digit is calculated. The ISBN-13 check digit, which is the last digit of the ISBN, must range from 0 to 9 and must be such that the sum of all the thirteen digits, each multiplied by its (integer) weight, alternating between 1 and 3, is a multiple of 10. As ISBN-13 is a subset of EAN-13, the algorithm for calculating the check digit is exactly the same for both.\nFormally, using modular arithmetic, this is rendered:\n\nThe calculation of an ISBN-13 check digit begins with the first twelve digits of the 13-digit ISBN (thus excluding the check digit itself). Each digit, from left to right, is alternately multiplied by 1 or 3, then those products are summed modulo 10 to give a value ranging from 0 to 9. Subtracted from 10, that leaves a result from 1 to 10. A zero replaces a ten, so, in all cases, a single check digit results.\nFor example, the ISBN-13 check digit of 978-0-306-40615-? is calculated as follows:\n\ns = 9\u00d71 + 7\u00d73 + 8\u00d71 + 0\u00d73 + 3\u00d71 + 0\u00d73 + 6\u00d71 + 4\u00d73 + 0\u00d71 + 6\u00d73 + 1\u00d71 + 5\u00d73\n  =   9 +  21 +   8 +   0 +   3 +   0 +   6 +  12 +   0 +  18 +   1 +  15\n  = 93\n93 \/ 10 = 9 remainder 3\n10 \u2013  3 = 7\n\nThus, the check digit is 7, and the complete sequence is ISBN 978-0-306-40615-7.\nIn general, the ISBN check digit is calculated as follows.\nLet\n\nThen\n\nThis check system\u2014similar to the UPC check digit formula\u2014does not catch all errors of adjacent digit transposition. Specifically, if the difference between two adjacent digits is 5, the check digit will not catch their transposition. For instance, the above example allows this situation with the 6 followed by a 1. The correct order contributes 3 \u00d7 6 + 1 \u00d7 1 = 19 to the sum; while, if the digits are transposed (1 followed by a 6), the contribution of those two digits will be 3 \u00d7 1 + 1 \u00d7 6 = 9. However, 19 and 9 are congruent modulo 10, and so produce the same, final result: both ISBNs will have a check digit of 7. The ISBN-10 formula uses the prime modulus 11 which avoids this blind spot, but requires more than the digits 0\u20139 to express the check digit.\nAdditionally, if the sum of the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th digits is tripled then added to the remaining digits (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, and 13th), the total will always be divisible by 10 (i.e., end in 0).\n\nISBN-10 to ISBN-13 conversion\nA 10-digit ISBN is converted to a 13-digit ISBN by prepending \"978\" to the  ISBN-10 and recalculating the final checksum digit using the ISBN-13 algorithm. The reverse process can also be performed, but not for numbers commencing with a prefix other than 978, which have no 10-digit equivalent.\n\nErrors in usage\nPublishers and libraries have varied policies about the use of the ISBN check digit. Publishers sometimes fail to check the correspondence of a book title and its ISBN before publishing it; that failure causes book identification problems for libraries, booksellers, and readers. For example, ISBN 0-590-76484-5 is shared by two books\u2014Ninja gaiden: a novel based on the best-selling game by Tecmo (1990) and Wacky laws (1997), both published by Scholastic.\nMost libraries and booksellers display the book record for an invalid ISBN issued by the publisher. The Library of Congress catalogue contains books published with invalid ISBNs, which it usually tags with the phrase \"Cancelled ISBN\". The International Union Library Catalog (a.k.a., WorldCat OCLC\u2014Online Computer Library Center system) often indexes by invalid ISBNs, if the book is indexed in that way by a member library.\n\neISBN\nOnly the term \"ISBN\" should be used; the terms \"eISBN\" and \"e-ISBN\" have historically been sources of confusion and should be avoided. If a book exists in one or more digital (e-book) formats, each of those formats must have its own ISBN. In other words, each of the three separate EPUB, Amazon Kindle, and PDF formats of a particular book will have its own specific ISBN. They should not share the ISBN of the paper version, and there is no generic \"eISBN\" which encompasses all the e-book formats for a title.\n\nEAN format used in barcodes, and upgrading\nThe barcodes on a book's back cover (or inside a mass-market paperback book's front cover) are EAN-13; they may have a separate barcode encoding five digits called an EAN-5 for the currency and the recommended retail price. For 10-digit ISBNs, the number \"978\", the Bookland \"country code\", is prefixed to the ISBN in the barcode data, and the check digit is recalculated according to the EAN-13 formula (modulo 10, 1\u00d7 and 3\u00d7 weighting on alternating digits).\nPartly because of an expected shortage in certain ISBN categories, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) decided to migrate to a 13-digit ISBN (ISBN-13). The process began on 1 January 2005 and was planned to conclude on 1 January 2007. As of 2011, all the 13-digit ISBNs began with 978. As the 978 ISBN supply is exhausted, the 979 prefix was introduced. Part of the 979 prefix is reserved for use with the Musicland code for musical scores with an ISMN. The 10-digit ISMN codes differed visually as they began with an \"M\" letter; the bar code represents the \"M\" as a zero, and for checksum purposes it counted as a 3. All ISMNs are now thirteen digits commencing 979-0; 979-1 to 979-9 will be used by ISBN.\nPublisher identification code numbers are unlikely to be the same in the 978 and 979 ISBNs, likewise, there is no guarantee that language area code numbers will be the same. Moreover, the 10-digit ISBN check digit generally is not the same as the 13-digit ISBN check digit. Because the GTIN-13 is part of the Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) system (that includes the GTIN-14, the GTIN-12, and the GTIN-8), the 13-digit ISBN falls within the 14-digit data field range.\nBarcode format compatibility is maintained, because (aside from the group breaks) the ISBN-13 barcode format is identical to the EAN barcode format of existing 10-digit ISBNs. So, migration to an EAN-based system allows booksellers the use of a single numbering system for both books and non-book products that is compatible with existing ISBN based data, with only minimal changes to information technology systems. Hence, many booksellers (e.g., Barnes & Noble) migrated to EAN barcodes as early as March 2005. Although many American and Canadian booksellers were able to read EAN-13 barcodes before 2005, most general retailers could not read them. The upgrading of the UPC barcode system to full EAN-13, in 2005, eased migration to the ISBN in North America.\n\nSee also\nASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number)\nBICI (Book Item and Component Identifier)\nBook sources search \u2013 a Wikipedia resource that allows search by ISBNs\nCODEN (serial publication identifier currently used by libraries; replaced by the ISSN for new works)\nDOI (Digital Object Identifier)\nESTC (English Short Title Catalogue)\nISAN (International Standard Audiovisual Number)\nISRC (International Standard Recording Code)\nISTC (International Standard Text Code)\nISWC (International Standard Musical Work Code)\nISSN (International Standard Serial Number)\nISWN (International Standard Wine Number)\nLCCN (Library of Congress Control Number)\nLicense number (East German books) (Book identification system used between 1951 and 1990 in the former GDR)\nList of group-0 ISBN publisher codes\nList of group-1 ISBN publisher codes\nList of ISBN registration groups\nSICI (Serial Item and Contribution Identifier)\nVD 16 (Verzeichnis der im deutschen Sprachbereich erschienenen Drucke des 16.

The main portion of the existing route begins at Vista Del Mar in Los Angeles near the Los Angeles International Airport and ends at the Anaheim\u2013Orange city line at Via Escola where it becomes Cannon Street. Historically, the Imperial Highway extended from Vista Del Mar to Calexico, where a portion of the highway still exists. The original route was replaced with other highways, leading the older portions of the Imperial Highway to fall out of use.\n\nRoute\nThe total length of the Greater Los Angeles portion of the Imperial Highway is approximately 41 miles (66 km), of which 14 miles (23 km) run through Orange County and 27 miles (43 km) through Los Angeles County.\nBetween SR 91 and SR 39, Imperial Highway is signed as State Route 90. A de facto freeway portion of the route in Yorba Linda is also known as the Richard M. Nixon Freeway.\nThe portion in Los Angeles County between Lakewood Boulevard and Valley View Avenue is located about one mile north of, and runs parallel to, Rosecrans Avenue.\n\nCities\nStarting from Cannon Street & Via Escola in Orange, going east to west Cannon Street becomes Imperial Highway upon entering Anaheim. The highway then passes through the cities and communities of Anaheim Hills, Yorba Linda, Placentia, Brea, Fullerton, La Habra, La Mirada, Santa Fe Springs (some sections in La Mirada and Santa Fe Springs are next to unincorporated LA County), Norwalk, Downey, South Gate, Lynwood, Los Angeles (Watts, and South LA \u2013 a portion after South LA is in unincorporated LA County), Inglewood, Hawthorne, El Segundo (southside of street only), and Westchester (part of Los Angeles on the northside). Imperial Highway ends at Dockweiler Beach on Vista Del Mar near Playa Del Rey, just past LAX.\n\nFreeways\nAlong its route, Imperial Highway crosses over or under these freeways from west to east:\n\nInterstate 105\nInterstate 405\nInterstate 110\nInterstate 710\nInterstate 605\nInterstate 5\nCalifornia State Route 57\nCalifornia State Route 91\nInterstate 8\n\nTransportation\nMetro Local lines 120 and formerly 625 run via Imperial Highway, as well as Norwalk Transit line 4; Metro line 625 ran between Pershing Drive and La Cienega Boulevard. Metro line 120 runs between Aviation Boulevard and Norwalk Station, and Norwalk line 4 between Norwalk Station and Beach Boulevard. Imperial intersects with the Metro A and C Lines at Wilmington Avenue in Willowbrook at the Willowbrook\/Rosa Parks station. There is also another C Line station at Aviation Boulevard.\nWestern terminus coordinates (El Segundo): 33\u00b055\u203250.91\u2033N 118\u00b026\u20325.42\u2033W\nEastern terminus coordinates (Anaheim): 33\u00b050\u20327.76\u2033N 117\u00b047\u203243.32\u2033W\n\nHistory\nImperial Highway was built in large part because of lobbying from the Imperial Highway Association, founded in 1929. The Imperial Highway Association lobbied city and county governments to build Imperial Highway, gaining cities along the way until the highway finished construction in 1961. \nImperial Highway was initially conceived as a commercial route connecting Imperial County to Los Angeles County. A segment remains today in Imperial County which connects Interstate 8 near Ocotillo. Another segment adjacent to Lake Elsinore (Riverside County) was once indicated on 1960s vicinity maps by H.M. Gousha (Gousha), publisher of street maps.\n\nOther uses\nThere are other Imperial Highways in the United States, including one in San Diego (better known as Imperial Avenue) and in the Detroit suburbs of Redford Township, Michigan and Westland, Michigan. Despite the name, Westland's version runs a mere three blocks, north from Bock Street, then northeast from Hambleton Street, across John Hauk Road and stopping at Pardo Street. (It used to continue to Ford Road, but this section has been a hardware store parking lot since the 1970s.)\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nBrigandi, Phil (Spring 2010). \"From the Desert to the Sea: The Story of the Imperial Highway\".

Since 2011 the alley has become a notable site for Los Angeles street art hosting murals and sculpture that commemorate its historical significance to Skid Row's American Indian community.\n\nHistory\nReferred to as \u201cone of the most famous public spaces in the country\u201d among Native Americans, the tiny street (officially named Werdin Place) lay adjacent to United American Indian Involvement, Inc. (UAII), an outreach center for American Indians that became an important locus for social, spiritual, political and rehabilitative activities for the community. Established in 1974, UAII provided health and support services to Los Angeles\u2019 Native American population, initially focused primarily on recovery services for those addicted to drugs and alcohol. During this time, Los Angeles was estimated to have the largest Native American population\u2014anywhere from 40,000 to 100,000\u2014of any city in the United States, with over 100 federally recognized tribes represented within LA county. In addition to its offices, the organization\u2019s facility included dormitories that became de facto residences for many displaced Indians. UAII anchored the block at 118 Winston Street, at the alley\u2019s northeast corner with Winston Street, until it moved to its new location at 1125 West 6th Street in the 1990s.\nIndian Alley comprises a block of Werdin Place, running south from Winston Street to East 5th Street. It is bounded to the west by Main Street and to the east by Los Angeles Street. The site has appeared as a location in numerous movies and television shows, including The Sting, Baretta, Hill Street Blues, Police Story, Quincy ME and Starsky & Hutch.\n\nIndian Alley Art Project\nIn recent years Indian Alley\u2019s heritage has been resurrected and commemorated through a series of murals and other public art installations in and around Werdin Place and Winston Street. Through the coordination of Stephen Zeigler and 118 Winston, an art gallery and yoga studio occupying the former UAII site, paintings and sculpture by prominent Los Angeles street artists depicting noteworthy Native American leaders and social activists have made Indian Alley a significant site for Los Angeles street art. When Zeigler and his wife moved into the space in 2008, he made a habit of cleaning the space in and around the alley, which was then commonly used for drug dealing and prostitution. Zeigler developed an interest in the history of the site; his research revealed the block\u2019s former significance to Los Angeles' American Indian population as well as its more common name, Indian Alley.\nIn 2011 Zeigler began recruiting local street artists to install murals in the alley, with the express purpose of highlighting the special heritage of the place. Murals and sculpture selected for their relevance to Indian Alley\u2019s history include portraits of local Native American activist Robert Sundance and eighteenth-century California anticolonialist Toypurina, along with Native American symbols and more abstract pieces and positive social messaging. Contributors to the ongoing art project include Maya\/Nahuatl artist Votan and Jemez Pueblo Indian Jaque Fragua, local artists Wild Life (American artist), Bandit, Sketchy, Gabette, Free Humanity, Random Act and Teacher, as well as street art notable Shepard Fairey.\n\nReferences\n16.

The entire route is known as the northern segment of the San Diego Freeway. I-405 is a bypass auxiliary route of I-5, running along the southern and western parts of the Greater Los Angeles urban area from Irvine in the south to Sylmar in the north.\nI-405, heavily traveled by both commuters and freight haulers along its entire length, is the busiest and most congested freeway in the United States. The freeway's annual average daily traffic between exits 21 and 22 in Seal Beach reached 374,000 in 2008, making it the highest count in the nation. It has played a crucial role in the development of dozens of cities and suburbs along its route through Los Angeles and Orange counties. It also serves Los Angeles International Airport, Long Beach Airport, and Orange County's John Wayne Airport.\n\nRoute description\nOrange County\nI-405 begins at the El Toro Y interchange in southeastern Irvine in Orange County, splitting from its parent I-5 and inheriting that route's San Diego Freeway title; I-5 continues north as the Santa Ana Freeway. The freeway passes immediately south of the Irvine Spectrum Center mall before intersecting with State Route 133 (SR 133). It then continues through Irvine, passing north of the University of California, Irvine, and then along the northern boundary of John Wayne Airport. After passing the airport, the freeway enters Costa Mesa and has an interchange with SR 55. It passes South Coast Plaza before a partial interchange with SR 73, which serves as a partially-tolled bypass of I-405 between Costa Mesa and Laguna Niguel.\nThe freeway then travels through Fountain Valley and along the edges of Westminster and Huntington Beach before entering Seal Beach, where it begins to run concurrently with SR 22. It continues along the northern edge of Seal Beach, passing between Naval Weapons Station Seal Beach and Joint Forces Training Base - Los Alamitos, before SR 22 splits from I-405 and continues west while the freeway turns north. I-405 then intersects the southern end of I-605 before crossing the San Gabriel River and entering Los Angeles County.\n\nLos Angeles County\nI-405 enters Los Angeles County in the city of Long Beach. It passes to the north of California State University, Long Beach, and then along the south of Long Beach Airport. The freeway then intersects with I-710 before entering Carson (and crossing through a small sliver of the city of Los Angeles before reentering Carson). It passes near California State University, Dominguez Hills, and Dignity Health Sports Park, home of Major League Soccer club LA Galaxy. A weigh station for both directions is located in Carson between the Avalon Boulevard and Main Street exits.\n\nThe freeway then intersects with I-110 as it briefly reenters the city of Los Angeles by passing through the Harbor Gateway, a strip of land connecting San Pedro to the rest of the city. I-405 then continues to roughly parallel the contour of the coastline as it passes through the South Bay communities of Torrance, Lawndale, Redondo Beach, Hawthorne, and El Segundo. The freeway then encounters I-105 on the southeastern corner of Los Angeles International Airport. It passes to the east of the airport, serving it with exits at the Imperial Highway and Century Boulevard.\nI-405 next passes through Inglewood, coming near SoFi Stadium, home to the Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Chargers of the National Football League. It then passes through Westchester and Culver City where it meets SR 90, the Marina Freeway. It serves the Los Angeles neighborhoods of Mar Vista and West Los Angeles while passing a few miles east of Santa Monica, intersecting with I-10 in the process. The freeway continues into Westwood, passing just to the west of University of California, Los Angeles. It then passes the Getty Center as it ascends Sepulveda Pass through the Santa Monica Mountains.\n\nAfter cresting the mountains, I-405 descends into the San Fernando Valley, intersecting US Route 101 (US 101) in the Sherman Oaks neighborhood of Los Angeles. The freeway then continues due north through the western part of the valley, passing east of Van Nuys Airport and California State University, Northridge. It intersects SR 118 in the Mission Hills area before ending in a merge with I-5 in Sylmar.\nI-405 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. The entire freeway is known as the San Diego Freeway, and parts of it are less commonly known as the Sepulveda Freeway (after Sepulveda Boulevard).\n\nExpress lanes\nHigh-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes along I-405 between SR 73 in Costa Mesa and the Orange\u2013Los Angeles county line opened on December 1, 2023. This was part of the I-405 Improvement Project that started construction in March 2018. The project included converting the existing high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes, with them closing in November to test the tolling equipment. In addition, two lanes in each direction were added in each direction, one toll lane and one general purpose lane, making the upgrade from five to seven lanes in each direction.\nAs of December 2023, the HOT lanes are a 24\/7 service. Solo drivers are tolled using a congestion pricing system based on the real-time levels of traffic. For two-person carpools, they would be charged the posted toll during weekday peak hours between 6:00 am and 10:00 am and between 3:00 pm and 8:00 pm and weekend peak hours between 1:00 pm and 6:00 pm; no toll would charged during off-peak hours until 3+1\u20442 years after their opening. Carpools with three or more occupants are not charged. All tolls are collected using an open road tolling system, and therefore there are no toll booths to receive cash. Each vehicle using the HOT lanes is required to carry a FasTrak Flex transponder, with its switch set to indicate the number of the vehicle's occupants (1, 2, or 3 or more). Solo drivers may also use the FasTrak standard tag without the switch. Drivers without any FasTrak tag will be assessed a toll violation regardless of whether they qualified for free.\n\nTraffic congestion\nThe freeway is one of the busiest freeways in the nation and is the busiest freeway in California. The freeway's congestion problems have led to jokes that the road was numbered 405 because traffic moves at \"four or five\" miles per hour (6.4 or 8.0 km\/h), or because drivers had spent \"four or five\" hours to travel anywhere. Indeed, average speeds as low as 5 mph (8.0 km\/h) are routinely recorded during morning and afternoon commutes, and its interchanges with the Ventura Freeway (US 101) and with the Santa Monica Freeway (I-10) each consistently rank among the five most congested freeway interchanges in the US. As a result of these congestion problems, delays passing through the entirety of Greater Los Angeles using this bypass route instead of merely using the primary route I-5 through Downtown Los Angeles may be present.\nI-405 is the only major north\u2013south freeway in the densely populated areas between West Los Angeles and Downtown Los Angeles, crossing the Santa Monica Mountains and connecting the San Fernando Valley and the Los Angeles Basin. It is also a major connection for traffic en route to either the Port of Los Angeles, the Port of Long Beach, Los Angeles International Airport, or SoFi Stadium. By 2040, this corridor is estimated to increase by 35 percent and travel times reduced by 75 percent. The freeway's West Los Angeles section is the subject of annual gridlock photos and videos taken during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, most often from an aerial view.\nAnother parallel freeway was proposed to connect the valley and basin (the Laurel Canyon Freeway or La Cienega Freeway) but has faced upper-class and NIMBY homeowner opposition. Despite four years of construction disruptions and billions of dollars of public money, Los Angeles Times commentary claims traffic with the lane expansions is actually just as bad or worse. \nUnlike some of the other major travel corridors in the region (such as I-5 which parallels the LOSSAN Corridor), I-405 has no rail-based public transit which parallels it along the west side of Orange and Los Angeles counties. There is a proposal for a Sepulveda Transit Corridor which would parallel I-405 through Sepulveda Pass, one of the major bottlenecks on the route, which would ease congestion by providing an alternative to driving.\n\nHistory\nI-405 was approved as a chargeable Interstate (in other words, an Interstate financed with federal funds) in 1955. The Division of Highways originally requested I-9 for the corridor, while the Santa Ana Freeway would be I-11; I-3 was later requested in April 1958 before the Division of Highways agreed to use I-405. Construction began in 1957 with the first section, mostly north of Los Angeles International Airport, which was completed in 1961 and initially signed as SR 7. The 5.7-mile (9.2 km) section through Sepulveda Pass was dedicated on December 21, 1962, and cost $20 million to construct. It was designed with a maximum grade of 5.5 percent and required the relocation of Sepulveda Boulevard and the Mulholland Highway, which was moved 1.1 miles (1.8 km) to the south along a new 579-foot-long (176 m) bridge over the freeway. Additional sections west of Alameda Street were completed in 1962 and 1963, creating 41.8 miles (67.3 km) of continuous freeway.\nThe highway was renumbered to I-405 during the 1964 state highway renumbering. The Orange County portion of the San Diego Freeway took 13 years to construct, with the first section opening in 1958; The final section of I-405, 8 miles (13 km) leading to I-5 in Irvine, was dedicated on December 6, 1968, and opened to traffic in January 1969.\n\n\"Carmageddon\"\nA section of I-405 was closed over the weekend of Friday, July 15, 2011, as part of the Sepulveda Pass Improvements Project. Before the closing, local radio DJs and television newscasts referred to it as \"Carmageddon\" and \"Carpocalypse\", parodying the notion of Armageddon and the Apocalypse, since it was anticipated that the closure would severely impact traffic. In reality, traffic was lighter than normal across a wide area. The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) reported that fewer vehicles used the roads than usual, and those who did travel by road arrived more quickly than on a normal weekend. The Metrolink commuter train system recorded its highest-ever weekend ridership since it began operating in 1991. Ridership was 50 percent higher than the same weekend in 2010 and 10 percent higher than the previous weekend ridership record, which occurred during the U2 360\u00b0 Tour in June 2011. The Los Angeles Times on Sunday, July 17, 2011, featured comments and images of people enjoying the moment next to the I-405 freeway with the free-flowing traffic.\nIn response to JetBlue's offer of special flights between Hollywood Burbank Airport in Burbank and Long Beach Airport, a distance of only 29 miles (47 km), for $4.00, a group of cyclists did the same journey in one and a half hours, compared to two and a half hours by plane (including a drive to the airport from West Hollywood 90 minutes in advance of the flight and travel time to the end destination). There was also some debate about whether the Los Angeles area could benefit from car-free weekends regularly.\nThe Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority then had full closure of a 10-mile (16 km) stretch of I-405 on the weekend of September 29\u201330, 2012, while construction crews worked to demolish a portion of the Mulholland Bridge.\nResearchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, used the closure of I-405 to study particulate matter air pollution. The researchers took air samples before, during, and after the closure. The researchers found an 83-percent reduction in ultrafine particles, 55-percent reduction in fine particle matter, and 62-percent less black carbon.\n\nSepulveda Pass Improvements Project\nThe $1-billion Sepulveda Pass Improvements Project added a high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane and associated changes to freeway entrances, exits, and underpasses along a 10-mile (16 km) stretch through Sepulveda Pass between I-10 and US 101\/Ventura Boulevard. The project was completed as a design\u2013build in contrast to the traditional design\u2013bid\u2013build used typically in infrastructure improvement. This section of I-405 was closed for a weekend in mid-July 2011 to demolish the Mulholland Drive Bridge, and a 10-mile (16 km) section was closed for the last weekend of September 2012.\nJamzilla was the name for the I-405 closure on Presidents' Day weekend 2014. There were lane closures and complete closures on I-405 starting February 14 at 10:00 pm until February 18 at 6:00 am to pave and restripe the northbound lanes.\nOn May 23, 2014, the 10-mile (16 km) HOV lane was opened to traffic.\n\nFuture\nManchester and Century Boulevard interchanges\nProposed changes between the Manchester and Century Boulevard interchanges in the city of Inglewood are to provide a new southbound onramp and a new northbound offramp for Arbor Vitae Street, to reconstruct and widened the Arbor Vitae Street over-bridge and replace the Century Boulevard overcrossing structure. This work would reduce congestion on the approach to Los Angeles International Airport. Caltrans has not yet issued a start date for this work.\n\nSepulveda Pass express lanes\nThe HOVs lane that were constructed as part of the Sepulveda Pass Improvements Project are proposed to be upgraded to express lanes by 2028.\n\nExit list\nSee also\nCalifornia Roads portal\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nCaltrans: I-405 highway conditions\nCaltrans Traffic Conditions Map\nCalifornia Highway Patrol Traffic Incidents\n405 Express Lanes official website\nCalifornia @ AARoads.com - I-405\nCalifornia Highways: I-405","116":"Jan and Dean were an American rock duo consisting of William Jan Berry (April 3, 1941 \u2013 March 26, 2004) and Dean Ormsby Torrence (born March 10, 1940).  In the early 1960s, they were pioneers of the California Sound and vocal surf music styles popularized by the Beach Boys.\nAmong their most successful songs was 1963's \"Surf City\", the first surf song ever to reach the #1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US.  Their other charting top 10 singles were \"Baby Talk\" (1959), \"Drag City\" (1963), \"Dead Man's Curve\" (1964; inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2008,) and \"The Little Old Lady (from Pasadena)\" (1964). \nIn 1972, Torrence won the Grammy Award for Best Album Cover for the psychedelic rock band Pollution's first eponymous 1971 album, and was nominated three other times in the same category for albums of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.  In 2013, Torrence's design contribution of the Surf City Allstars' In Concert CD was named a Silver Award of Distinction at the Communicator Awards competition.\n\nEarly lives\nWilliam Jan Berry (April 3, 1941 \u2013 March 26, 2004), was born in Los Angeles to Clara Lorentze Mustad (born September 2, 1919, Bergen, Norway \u2013 died July 9, 2009) and aeronautical engineer William L. Berry (born December 7, 1909, New York City \u2013 died December 19, 2004, Camarillo, California), He was raised in Bel Air, Los Angeles. Jan's father worked for Howard Hughes as a project manager of the \"Spruce Goose\" and flew on its only flight with Hughes.\nDean Ormsby Torrence (born  (1940-03-10) March 10, 1940) was born in Los Angeles, the son of Natalie Ormsby (April 10, 1911 \u2013 August 10, 2008) and Maurice Dean Torrence (December 5, 1907 \u2013 November 16, 1997). His father, Maurice, was a graduate of Stanford University, and was a sales manager at the Wilshire Oil Company.\n\nHistory\n1957\u201359: formation\nBerry and Torrence met while both were students at Emerson Junior High School in Westwood, Los Angeles, and both were on the school's football team.  By 1957, they were students in the  class of 1958 at the nearby University High School, where again they were both on the school's football team, the Warriors. Berry and Torrence had adjoining lockers, and after football practice, they began harmonizing together in the showers with several other football players, including future actor James Brolin.\n\nThe Barons\nIn order to enter a talent competition at University High School, Berry and Torrence helped form a doo-wop group known as \"The Barons\" (named after their high school's Hi-Y club, of which they were members), which was composed of fellow University High students William \"Chuck\" Steele (lead singer), Arnold P. \"Arnie\" Ginsburg (born November 19, 1939; 1st tenor), Wallace S. \"Wally\" Yagi (born July 20, 1940; 2nd tenor), John 'Sagi\" Seligman (2nd tenor), with Berry singing bass and Torrence providing falsetto.\nDuring its short duration, Sandy Nelson, Torrence's neighbor, played drums, and future Beach Boy Bruce Johnston occasionally sang and played piano. The Barons rehearsed for hours in Berry's parents' garage, where Berry's father provided an upright piano and two two-track Ampex reel-to-reel tape recorders.\nIn 1958, the Barons performed to popular acclaim at the talent competition at University High School, covering contemporary hits like \"Get a Job\", \"Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay\", and \"Short Shorts\". Following the contest, various members of the Barons drifted away, leaving only Berry and Torrence, who tried to write their own songs.\n\nJan & Arnie\nAfter being inspired by a poster featuring a local Hollywood burlesque performer, Virginia Lee Hicks, who was then performing as Jennie Lee, the \"Bazoom Girl\", at the New Follies Burlesk at 548 S. Main St, Los Angeles,  Ginsburg wrote a tribute song, \"Jennie Lee\", that he brought to Berry and Torrence. Berry adapted the Civil War tune \"Aura Lea\" and arranged the harmonies. After weeks of practice, Berry, Ginsburg, and Torrence planned to make a demo recording in Berry's garage, but Torrence was conscripted into the United States Army Reserve, forcing Berry and Ginsburg to record \"Jennie Lee\" without Torrence, with Berry's friend and fellow University High student Donald J. Altfeld (born March 18, 1940, in Los Angeles ) \"beating out the rhythm on a children's metal high chair\". The next day Berry took their recording to Radio Recorders, a small recording studio, to have it transferred to an acetate disc. Joe Lubin, Vice President and Head of A & R of Arwin Records, was impressed and offered to add instruments and to release it through Arwin.\nIn March 1958, the fathers of Berry and Ginsburg signed contracts authorizing Lubin to produce, arrange, and manage their sons.\nProduced by Lubin, \"Jennie Lee\" (Arwin 108), backed with \"Gotta Get a Date\" (credited to Ginsburg, Berry & Lubin), became a surprise commercial success. According to Berry biographer Mark A. Moore, \"The song (with backing vocals, plus additional instruments added by the Ernie Freeman combo) had a raucous R&B flavor, with a bouncing bomp-bomp vocal hook that would become a signature from Jan on future recordings.\" Distributed by Dot Records, \"Jennie Lee\" was released in mid-April, entered the charts on May 10, 1958, the same day they appeared on ABC's Dick Clark Show. \"Jennie Lee\" peaked at No. 3 on the Cash Box charts on June 21, 1958, No. 4 on the R&B charts, and No. 8 on the Billboard charts on June 30, 1958. Billy Ward and his Dominoes's R&B cover of \"Jennie Lee\" reached No. 55 in the Pop charts in June 1958, while other cover versions including that of Moon Mullican (Coral 9-61994) and Bobby Phillips & the Toppers (Tops 45-R422-49), released in 1958 failed to chart.\nIn July 1958, Jan & Arnie released their second single, \"Gas Money\" backed with \"Bonnie Lou\" (Arwin 111), both written by Berry, Ginsburg, and Altfeld. Like \"Jennie Lee\", \"Gas Money\" contained a few elements of what would later become surf music. It entered the Billboard charts on August 24, 1958, and peaked at No. 81 a week later. Jan & Arnie were a featured act on the Summer Dance Party that toured the US East Coast, including Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Connecticut in July 1958. By the end of the month, they traveled to Manhattan to appear on The Dick Clark Show.\nOn August 24, 1958, Jan & Arnie played in a live show hosted by Dick Clark that featured Bobby Darin, the Champs, Sheb Wooley, the Blossoms, the Six Teens, Jerry Wallace, Jack Jones, Rod McKuen and the Ernie Freeman Orchestra in front of nearly 12,000 fans at the first rock-n-roll show ever held at the Hollywood Bowl.\nBy September 6, 1958, Jan & Arnie's third and final single, \"The Beat That Can't Be Beat\" backed with \"I Love Linda\" (Arwin 113), again composed by the Berry, Ginsburg, and Altfeld team, was released. However this single failed to chart, due in part to a lack of distribution. On October 19, 1958, Jan & Arnie performed \"The Beat That Can't Be Beat\" on CBS's Jack Benny Show.\nArnie Ginsburg recorded a one-off single with a band named the Rituals on the Arwin label. The single, \"Girl in Zanzibar\" b\/w \"Guitarro\", was released on vinyl in January 1959, preceding Jan and Dean's first single \"Baby Talk\", released in May 1959. Other than Arnie, the single featured Richard Podolor on guitar, Sandy Nelson on drums, Bruce Johnston on piano, Dave Shostac on sax, Harper Cosby on bass, and Mike Deasy on guitar. It is unclear if the actual single was released for the general public but there are several promotional copies pressed to vinyl in existence.\nBy the end of the year, when Torrence had completed his six-month stint at Fort Ord, Ginsburg had become disenchanted with the music business. Ginsburg enrolled in the School of Architecture and Design at the University of Southern California and graduated in the field of product design in 1966. After graduation Ginsburg worked for several noted Los Angeles architects, among them Charles Eames, and in December 1973 he was granted a U.S. patent for a table he designed.\nGinsburg moved in 1975 to Santa Barbara, California, where he worked as an architectural designer. designing the innovative Ginsburg House. In September 1976, Ginsburg and Michael W. O'Neill were granted a patent for a portable batting cage.\n\n1959\u201362: early records\nAfter Torrence returned from a six-month compulsory stint in the US Army Reserve, Berry and Torrence began to make music as \"Jan and Dean\". With the help of record producers Herb Alpert and Lou Adler, Jan and Dean scored a No. 10 hit on the Dore label with \"Baby Talk\" (1959) (which was incorrectly labeled as Jan & Arnie when it initially was released), then scored a series of hits over the next couple of years. Playing local venues, they met and performed with the Beach Boys, and discovered the appeal of the latter's \"surf sound\". By this time Berry was co-writing, arranging, and producing all of Jan and Dean's original material.\nDuring this time Berry co-wrote or arranged and produced songs for other artists outside of Jan and Dean, including the Angels (\"I Adore Him\", Top 30), the Gents, the Matadors (Sinners), Pixie (unreleased), Jill Gibson, Shelley Fabares, Deane Hawley, the Rip Chords (\"Three Window Coupe\", Top 30), and Johnny Crawford, among others.\nUnlike most other rock 'n roll acts of the period, Jan and Dean did not give music their full-time attention. Jan and Dean were college students, maintaining their studies while writing and recording music and making public appearances on the side. Torrence majored in advertising design in the school of architecture at USC, where he also was a member of the Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity. Berry took science and music classes at UCLA, became a member of Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, and entered the California College of Medicine (now the UC Irvine School of Medicine) in 1963.\n\n1963\u201366: peak years\nJan and Dean reached their commercial peak in 1963 and 1964, after they met Brian Wilson. The duo scored sixteen Top 40 hits on the Billboard and Cash Box magazine charts, with a total of twenty-six chart hits over an eight-year period (1959-1966). Berry and Wilson collaborated on roughly a dozen hits and album cuts for Jan and Dean, including \"Surf City\", co-written by Jan Berry and Brian Wilson  (#1, 1963).  Subsequent top 10 hits included \"Drag City\" (#10, 1964), the eerily portentous \"Dead Man's Curve\" (#8, 1964), and \"The Little Old Lady from Pasadena\" (#3, 1964).\nIn 1964, at the height of their fame, Jan and Dean hosted and performed at The T.A.M.I. Show, a historic concert film directed by Steve Binder. The film also featured such acts as the Rolling Stones, Chuck Berry, Gerry & the Pacemakers, James Brown, Billy J. Kramer & the Dakotas, Marvin Gaye, the Supremes, Lesley Gore, Smokey Robinson & the Miracles and the Beach Boys. Also in 1964, the duo performed the title track for the Columbia Pictures film Ride the Wild Surf, starring Fabian Forte, Tab Hunter, Peter Brown, Shelley Fabares, and Barbara Eden. The song, penned by Jan Berry, Brian Wilson and Roger Christian, was a Top 20 national hit. The pair were also to have appeared in the film, but their roles were cut following their friendship with Barry Keenan, who had engineered the Frank Sinatra Jr. kidnapping.\nJan and Dean also filmed two unreleased television pilots: Surf Scene in 1963 and On the Run in 1966. Their feature film for Paramount Pictures Easy Come, Easy Go was canceled when Berry, as well as the film's director and other crew members, were seriously injured in a railroad accident while shooting the film in Chatsworth, California, in August 1965.\nAfter the surfing craze, Jan and Dean scored two Top-30 hits in 1965: \"You Really Know How to Hurt a Guy\" got up to 27 and \"I Found a Girl\" got to 30\u2014the latter from the album Folk 'n Roll. During this period, they also began to experiment with cutting-edge comedy concepts such as the original (unreleased) Filet of Soul and Jan & Dean Meet Batman. The former's album cover shows Berry with his leg in a cast as a result of the accident while filming Easy Come, Easy Go.\nIn 1966, Jan Berry recorded \"The Universal Coward\", an angry response to Donovan\u2019s anti-war single \"Universal Soldier\"(originally written by Buffy Sainte-Marie) even though Berry never served in the military.\n\n1966\u201368: Berry's car wreck\nOn April 12, 1966, Berry received severe head injuries in an automobile accident on Whittier Drive, just a short distance from Dead Man's Curve in Beverly Hills, California, two years after the song had become a hit. He was en route to a business meeting when he crashed his Corvette into a parked truck on Whittier Drive, near the intersection of Sunset Boulevard, in Beverly Hills. Berry also had separated from his girlfriend of seven years, singer-artist Jill Gibson, later a member of the Mamas & the Papas for a short time, who also had co-written several songs with him. He was in a coma for more than two months before finally awakening on the morning of June 16.\nBerry recovered from brain damage and partial paralysis. He had limited use of his right arm, and had to learn to write with his left hand as well as learning to walk again.\nIn Berry's absence, Torrence released several singles on the J&D Record Co. label and recorded Save for a Rainy Day in 1966, a concept album featuring all rain-themed songs. Torrence posed with Berry's brother Ken for the album cover photos. Columbia Records released one single from the project (\"Yellow Balloon\") as did the song's writer, Gary Zekley, with the group the Yellow Balloon.\n\n Besides his studio work, Torrence became a graphic artist, starting his own company, Kittyhawk Graphics, and designing and creating album covers and logos for other musicians and recording artists, including Harry Nilsson, Steve Martin, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Dennis Wilson, Bruce Johnston, the Beach Boys, Diana Ross and the Supremes, Linda Ronstadt, Canned Heat, the Ventures and many others. Torrence (with Gene Brownell) won a Grammy Award for \"Album Cover of the Year\" in 1971, for the album Pollution by Pollution on Prophesy Records.\nBerry returned to the studio in April 1967, almost one year to the day after his accident. Working with Alan Wolfson, he began writing and producing music again. In December 1967, Jan and Dean signed an agreement with Warner Bros. Records. Warner issued three singles under the name \"Jan and Dean\", but a 1968 Berry-produced album for Warner Bros., the psychedelic Carnival of Sound, remained unreleased until February 2010, when Rhino Records' \"Handmade\" label put out CD and vinyl compilations of all tracks recorded for Carnival, along with various outtakes and remixes from the project.\n\nLater years\nIn 1971, Jan and Dean released the album Jan & Dean Anthology Album under the label United Artists Records. The album included many of their top hits, starting with 1958's \"Jennie Lee\" and ending with 1968's \"Vegetables\".\nBerry began to sing again in the early 1970s, touring with his Aloha band, while Dean began performing with a band called Papa Doo Run Run.\nOn August 26, 1973, Torrence was scheduled to appear at the Hollywood Palladium as part of Jim Pewter's \"Surfer's Stomp\" reunion. Torrence had recently released some Jan & Dean songs with new vocal parts by Bruce Johnston (of the Beach Boys) and producer Terry Melcher under the moniker the Legendary Masked Surfers. Torrence arranged with Berry to join him lip-syncing on stage to a pre-recorded track. The two anticipated that the audience would know it was a tape recording, and they decided to make light of it during the performance. That night, they joked around and stopped lip-syncing on stage while the music continued, but the audience became angry and started booing. The duo's first live performance after Berry's accident occurred at the Palomino Nightclub in North Hollywood on June 5, 1976, ten years after the accident, as guests of Disneyland regulars Papa Doo Run Run. Their first actual multi-song concert billed as Jan and Dean took place in 1978 in New York City at the Palladium as part of the Murray the K Brooklyn Fox Reunion Show. This was followed by a handful of East Coast shows as guests of their longtime friends the Beach Boys. Four nationwide J & D headlining tours followed through 1980. Berry was still suffering the effects of his 1966 accident, with partial paralysis and aphasia.\nThe duo experienced a resurgence after Paul Morantz's \"Road back from Deadman's Curve\" article appeared in Rolling Stone in 1974, writing the piece after spending extensive time with the two singers, their families, doctors and associates. Morantz first submitted the story to Playboy, who recommended it to Rolling Stone. He then wrote a film treatment from his story which was purchased by CBS.\nOn February 3, 1978, CBS aired a made-for-TV film about the duo titled Deadman's Curve. The biopic starred Richard Hatch as Jan Berry and Bruce Davison as Dean Torrence, with cameo appearances by Dick Clark, Wolfman Jack, Mike Love of the Beach Boys, and Bruce Johnston (who at that time was temporarily out of the Beach Boys), as well as Berry himself. Near the end of the film he can be seen sitting in the audience, watching \"himself\" (Richard Hatch) perform onstage. The part of Jan and Dean's band was played by Papa Doo Run Run, which included Mark Ward and Jim Armstrong, who went on to form Jan and Dean and the Bel-Air Bandits. Johnston and Berry had known each other since high school, and had played music together in Berry's garage in Bel Air \u2014 long before Jan and Dean or the Beach Boys were formed. Following the release of the film, the duo made steps toward an official comeback that year, including touring with the Beach Boys, and performing with Papa Doo Run Run at Cupertino High School. In the Netherlands the showing on television of the movie by Veronica in August 1979 earned them a huge hit record of the re-recorded \"Surf City\" and \"Deadman's Curve\" songs as a double A-sided single record release, and a golden oldies record having \"The Little Old Lady From Pasadena\" as its flip side reached a lower position in the charts.\nIn the early 1980s, Papa Doo Run Run left to explore other performance and recording ventures. Berry struggled to overcome drug addiction. In 1979, Berry had performed over 100 concerts of Jan and Dean songs with another front man from Hawaii, Randy Ruff. Torrence also toured briefly as \"Mike & Dean\", with Mike Love of the Beach Boys. Later, the duo reunited for good. In \"Phase II\" of their career, Torrence led the touring operation.\n\nJan and Dean continued to tour on their own throughout the 1980s, the 1990s, and into the new millennium \u2013 with 1960s nostalgia providing them with a ready audience, headlining oldies shows throughout North America. Sundazed Records reissued Torrence's Save for a Rainy Day in 1996 in CD and vinyl formats, as well as the collector's vinyl 45 rpm companion EP, \"Sounds For A Rainy Day\", featuring four instrumental versions of the album's tracks.\nBetween the 1970s and the early 2000s, Torrence issued a number of re-recordings of classic Jan and Dean and Beach Boys hits. A double album titled One Summer Night \/ Live was issued by Rhino Records in 1982. Torrence released the album Silver Summer with the help of Mike Love in 1985 for Jan & Dean's 25th anniversary. Silver Summer was officially released as a Jan & Dean album, but falsely gives credit to Berry as co-producer and singer; Berry did not contribute to the album. Torrence participated with Berry on Port to Paradise, released as a cassette on the J&D Records label in 1986. In 1997, after many years of hard work, Berry released a solo album called Second Wave on One Way Records. June 11, 2002, Torrence released a solo album titled Anthology: Legendary Masked Surfer Unmasked.\nOn August 31, 1991, Berry married Gertie Filip at the Stardust Convention Centre in Las Vegas, Nevada. Torrence was Berry's best man at the wedding.\n\nBerry's death\nBerry died on March 26, 2004, as the result of a seizure at age 62. He was an organ donor and his body was cremated. On April 18, a \"Celebration of Life\" was held in Berry's memory at the Roxy Theatre on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood, California. Attendees included Torrence, Lou Adler, Jill Gibson, and Nancy Sinatra, along with many family members, friends, and musicians associated with Jan and Dean and the Beach Boys, including the original members of Papa Doo Run Run.\nIn February 2010, the Jan and Dean album Carnival of Sound was released on the Rhino Handmade label. The album cover was designed by Torrence. Along with the CD, there was a limited edition (1500 copies), which included a 10-track LP. The album was released in Europe in April 2010 in its original US form.\nIn 2012, Torrence reunited with Bruce Davison, who portrayed him in the 1978 film Deadman's Curve, to perform with the Bamboo Trading Company on their From Kitty Hawk To Surf City album. The songs were \"Shrewd Awakening\" and \"Tonga Hut\", which was featured on the film Return of the Killer Shrews, a sequel to the 1959 film The Killer Shrews and also \"Tweet (Don't Talk Anymore)\", \"Drinkin' In the Sunshine\", and \"Star Of The Beach\". The album also features Dean's two daughters, Jillian and Katie Torrence. Torrence and his two daughters were featured in the music video of \"Shrewd Awakening\".\nAfter Berry's death, Torrence began touring occasionally with the Surf City All-Stars. He serves as a spokesman for the City of Huntington Beach, California, which, thanks in part to his efforts, is nationally recognized as \"Surf City USA\". Torrence's website features\u2014among other things\u2014rare images, a complete Jan and Dean discography, a biography, and a timeline of his career with cohort Jan Berry. He currently resides in Huntington Beach, California, with his wife and two daughters.\n\nLegacy\nIn 1964, Jan and Dean were signed to host what became the first multi-act rock and roll show that was edited into a motion picture designed for wide distribution. The T.A.M.I. Show became a seminal and original production \u2013 in essence one of the first rock videos \u2013 on its release in 1964. Using a high-resolution videotape process called Electronovision (transferred from television directly onto 35mm motion picture stock as a kinescope), new sound recording techniques and having a remarkable cast, The T.A.M.I. Show set the standard for all succeeding music film and video work, including many of the early videos shown by MTV 17 years later. The revolutionary technical achievements of The T.A.M.I. Show and the list of performers (including a performance by James Brown that many critics have called the best of his career) marked a high point for Jan and Dean, as they were the hosts and one of the main featured acts as well. They became one of the main faces of mid-1960s music, until Berry's auto accident two years later, through their T.A.M.I. Show appearance.\nAccording to rock critic Dave Marsh, the attitude and public persona of punk rock can be traced to Jan and Dean.\nBrian Wilson has cited Berry as having a direct impact on his own growth as a record producer.\nIn an interview conducted by Jan and Dean fan and historian David Beard for the Collectors' Choice release, Jan & Dean, the Complete Liberty Singles, Dean Torrence stated that he felt the duo should be in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame: \"We have the scoreboard if you just want to compare number of hits and musical projects done. We beat 75 percent of the people in there. So what else is it? I've got to think that we were pretty irreverent when it came to the music industry. They kind of always held that against us. That's okay with me.\"\nJan and Dean were inducted into the Hollywood Rock Walk of Fame on April 12, 1996, exactly 30 years after Jan Berry had his near fatal car accident.\nOn January 28, 2023, Jan and Dean were inducted into the California Music Hall Of Fame.\nThe Who covered Jan and Dean's \"Bucket T\" on their UK EP Ready Steady Who from 1966, one of only a few songs the group performed where surf-fan Keith Moon provided the lead vocals.\nAlternative rock group the Red Hot Chili Peppers referenced the duo in their song \"Did I Let You Know\", on the album I'm with You.\n\nDiscography\nReferences\nSources\nAdams, Mark, Jan & Dean\/Dean Torrence Interviews, archived from the original on 2007-11-14, retrieved 2007-02-15\nBerry, Torrence, Jan & Dean Archives Volume 1.

It is owned by the Public Media Group of Southern California alongside the market's primary PBS member, Huntington Beach\u2013licensed KOCE-TV (channel 50). The two stations share studios at The Pointe (on West Alameda Avenue and Bob Hope Drive, between The Burbank Studios and Walt Disney Studios complexes) in Burbank; KCET's transmitter is located atop Mount Wilson in the San Gabriel Mountains (north of Sierra Madre).\n\nHistory\nBackground of educational television in Southern California\nKCET was the second attempt at establishing an educational station in the Los Angeles area: KTHE, operated by the University of Southern California, had previously broadcast on channel 28, beginning on September 22, 1953. It was the second educational television station in the United States, signing on six months and four days after KUHT in Houston, but ceased broadcasting after only nine months on the air because its primary benefactor, the Hancock Foundation, determined that the station was too much of a financial drain on its resources.\n\nStation history\nEarly history, as an NET station\nKCET\u2014the call letters of which stand for either California Educational Television, Committee for Educational Television, Community Educational Television, or Cultural and Educational Television\u2014first signed on the air on September 28, 1964, as an affiliate of National Educational Television (NET). The station was originally licensed to the non-profit group Community Television of Southern California (CTSC). Part of the station's initial funding came from four of Los Angeles's commercial stations\u2013KNXT (channel 2; now KCBS-TV), KNBC (channel 4), KTTV (channel 11) and KCOP (channel 13)\u2013along with grants from the Ford Foundation and the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare. KCET initially broadcast in black and white from Monday through Friday. James Loper, a co-founder of CTSC, served as the station's director of education from 1964 to 1966 and then vice president and general manager from 1966 to 1971. Loper then served as president of KCET from 1971 to 1983. Creative Person\u2014John Burton a 30-minute film biography of Glass artist and Philosopher John Burton was the first color film commissioned by KCET-TV in 1965. It won the first two Los Angeles area Emmys for KCET for John Burton, and for the production by George Van Valkenburg. Van Valkenburg also produced a one-hour documentary film titled Paris Air Show 1967 for KCET.\nKCET was originally located at 1313 North Vine Street in Hollywood, at what was the original Mutual-Don Lee Broadcasting System Building.  The facility was also originally home to two of Los Angeles' first television stations\u2014KTSL (channel 2; now KCBS-TV), and KFI\/KHJ-TV (channel 9; now KCAL-TV), which both signed-on the air in May, and August 1948 respectively.  Both stations eventually moved out by the early 1960s, just a couple of years before KCET officially took to the air.  ABC also began taking up occupancy in the building, using it as a secondary studio facility for its television studio lot (which at the time also housed KABC-TV) near the eastern end of Hollywood.\nPrior to applying for and receiving a construction permit to build the new channel 28, CTSC attempted to acquire one of Los Angeles's seven existing VHF commercial stations. In 1968, Community Television of Southern California emerged as a potential buyer of KTLA's channel 5 license from then-owner Gene Autry, but could not raise the cash needed to make a serious offer. If CTSC succeeded in moving KCET to channel 5, the move would have mirrored a similar occurrence seven years earlier in the New York City area, where local broadcasters assisted a non-profit group in purchasing commercial independent VHF station WNTA-TV and converting it into non-commercial, educational WNDT (it is now WNET).\n\nAs a PBS member station\nOn October 5, 1970, KCET became a charter member of the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) at the programming service's inception. For most of the next 40 years, it was the second most-watched PBS station in the country and occasionally produced programs distributed to PBS and to individual public television stations. The station served as Southern California's flagship PBS member station, with San Bernardino-licensed KVCR (channel 24)\u2014which the San Bernardino Community College District signed on the air on September 11, 1962\u2014as the service's original sole secondary outlet. KCET gained additional competitors when the Coast Community College District signed on Huntington Beach-licensed KOCE-TV (channel 50) on November 20, 1972, and the Los Angeles Unified School District signed on secondary Los Angeles member KLCS (channel 58) on November 5, 1973.\nIn 1971, KCET purchased the former Monogram Pictures property at 1425 Fleming Street (now Hoover Street) in a historic area of East Hollywood\u2014which was used as a film and television studio from 1912 to 1970\u2014to serve as the station's headquarters, an acquisition assisted in part by financial contributions from both the Ford Foundation and the Michael Connell Foundation. The building was renamed the Weingart Educational Telecommunications Center and housed KCET's master control, digital control rooms, ingest, and editing stations on the first floor, and engineering, and new media operations, and news and public affairs departments on the second floor.\nIn 1994, KCET and Store of Knowledge Inc., a Cerritos-based company, launched the KCET Store of Knowledge in Glendale as the first of many partnership stores with PBS affiliates. The store was a partnership between KCET, educational store Lakeshore Learning Materials, and the venture capital firm of Riordan, Lewis and Haden, which included former Los Angeles mayor Richard Riordan. The chain continued to operate until 2001. In 2004, as part of its image-reclaiming public relations after the Gulf oil spill, BP started granting KCET half the funding for preschool shows including A Place of Our Own and Los Ninos en Su Casa, a Spanish-language version. The other half of the $50 million grants for the show and supporting outreach programs came from First 5 California plus additional funding from an anonymous donor. The show won Peabody and local Emmy awards and was shown nationally over PBS. KCET renamed its production studio to BP Studios in thanks.\nPBS included BP's and other grants for the two pre-school shows in its complex progressive dues structures, even though the grants came with the stipulation that they could not be used for administrative costs. The PBS dues for KCET had previously been $4.9 million but with the grants included the dues increased by 40% to close to $7 million. Other large funding sources that had previously been counted on were shrinking and thus could not be tapped to pay the dues. KCET's request that these specific grants, which were restricted to show production only, not be counted towards the dues owed was denied; PBS executives indicated that PBS stations were expected to anticipate their dues and increase their reserves to pay them, and therefore would not give special treatment to KCET. With the January 2010 half-year payment coming up, KCET offered to reduce their status to a secondary affiliation, reducing the dues owed to a total of $1.3 million. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) would pay $750,000 and a special campaign was to raise the rest. PBS rejected the offer, insisting the station remain as the primary affiliate.\n\nAs an independent public television station\nOn October 8, 2010, KCET announced that it could not reach an agreement to remain with PBS, and would end its partnership with PBS after 40 years to become an independent public television station\u2014the second-largest such station in the United States in terms of market size, behind WNYE-TV in New York City\u2014on January 1, 2011. KCET station management cited unresolvable financial and programming disputes among its major reasons for leaving PBS. After channel 28 left PBS, KOCE-TV replaced KCET as the area's primary PBS station. Prior to the new affiliation arrangement, KCET discussed plans to purchase KOCE-TV from its licensee, the Coast Community College District, but later opted not to place a bid for the station. A consortium involving Southern California's PBS stations\u2014KCET, KOCE, secondary Los Angeles affiliate KLCS and San Bernardino-licensed KVCR\u2014was also proposed to be formed to unite various functions, certain programming, fundraising and marketing, to save money. However, KCET passed on the offer.\nOn February 4, 2011, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) fined KCET $10,000 for failure to make its public file available for inspection by the general public. On March 30, 2011, the Los Angeles Times reported that in light of the sharp decrease in KCET's ratings and pledges following disaffiliation from PBS, it was in negotiations to sell the Hollywood studio to the Church of Scientology, with KCET relocating to a smaller site following the sale. The sale of the property, which was sold for $45 million, closed on April 25, 2011, with part of the proceeds going towards KCET's leasing of the studios until new facilities were found. KCET relocated in April 2012 to a new complex in a high-rise, state-of-the art building, The Pointe located in Burbank. The move left CW affiliate KTLA (channel 5) as the last remaining radio or television broadcaster in Los Angeles that maintains studio facilities in Hollywood, as other area stations had moved their operations to other L.A.-area neighborhoods and cities within the region. At the end of the 2011 fiscal year, contributions and grants to KCET decreased even further, down 41% from the previous year to $22.3 million.\nIn August 2011, KCET and Eyetronics Media & Studios (a company owned by former Walt Disney Company executive Dominique Bigle) agreed to partner on producing or acquiring Southern California-focused original series.\n\nMerger with Link TV\nIn October 2012, KCET announced it intended to merge with San Francisco-based Link Media (owner of non-commercial satellite network Link TV) to form KCETLink, a joint non-profit venture based in Burbank operating as a single 501(c)(3) multimedia organization; under the terms of the agreement, KCET would also add Link TV on one of the station's digital subchannels. KCETLink then reached a much wider broadcast audience that includes Link Media's 33 million subscribers on DirecTV and Dish Network, and KCET's 5.6 million households in Southern and Central California. On January 5, 2015, Michael Riley, former executive at ABC Family (now Freeform), was named the new CEO of KCETLink (replacing Al Jerome, who left in January 16, 2017, KCET would later stop carrying Link TV over the air, replacing it with PBS Kids Channel.\n\nMerger with KOCE; return to PBS\nOn April 25, 2018, KCETLink Media Group and the KOCE-TV Foundation announced that they would merge. KOCE would remain the primary PBS station for the market, but KCET would return to the network as a secondary member, and both stations would continue to provide their existing programming services. Once the merger was completed, KOCE moved from its Costa Mesa, California, facility to the current KCET facility in Burbank, while maintaining the Costa Mesa location as a secondary facility. In a joint statement, the two organizations stated that this merger would \"[combine] PBS SoCal's beloved quality programming and community engagement excellence with KCETLink's passion for creating smart, original content that captures the spirit of the region\". The merger was completed on October 1, 2018, with the combined company branded as Public Media Group of Southern California.\nIn October 2019 (one year after the merger with KOCE was completed), KCET officially rejoined PBS after eight years as an educational independent station. In January 2024, PBS SoCal announced plans to rebrand KCET as PBS SoCal Plus starting on February 6.\n\nSubchannel history\nIn 2006, KCET launched a digital channel, KCET Desert Cities, for digital television and cable for the Coachella Valley. (In September of that year, KCET announced a similar channel for Orange County in partnership with California State University, Fullerton to be launched in late 2007, when it replaced a simulcast of KCET's analog signal.) In August 2007, KCET began carrying PBS and American Public Television's cultural, news and history-oriented network PBS World on digital subchannel 28.4, and the Spanish language educational network V-me on digital subchannel 28.3.\nWith KCET discontinuing its membership with PBS on January 1, 2011, KCET restructured its subchannel offerings; KCET-DT 28.2 converted to children's programming service under the brand KCET Kids & Family, itself a conversion of KCET Desert Cities and KCET Orange (with programs seen on the respective channels being shifted to KCET's main channel to occupy a daytime lifestyle block), while PBS World was replaced by MHz Worldview on KCET-DT4. (V-me programming continued to be carried on KCET-DT3.) KCET primary subchannel offered themed nights during the first year of operation. On January 1, 2013, as a byproduct of the Link Media merger, LinkTV\u2014under the brand \"KCETLink\", which replaced the channel's national feed on local cable and satellite providers and simulcasted LinkTV-licensed content\u2014replaced KCET Kids & Family on digital subchannel 28.2.\nOn August 5, 2013, KCET replaced MHz Worldview with NHK World on subchannel 28.4. (MHz Worldview moved to a subchannel of KLCS-DT.) On March 30, 2017, KCET ceased carrying V-Me on its subchannel as the network transitioned to a commercial ad-supported channel. KCET is in the process of determining what might replace the network. It was replaced by KCETLink+ on the same day. KCETLink+ was eventually shut down and NHK World moved up to the 28.3 subchannel with its former 28.4 subchannel discontinued.\n\nProgramming\nWhile it acted as the flagship PBS station for the Los Angeles metropolitan area, KCET mainly distributed Los Angeles-based productions for other independent producers, rather than producing much programming by itself for the national PBS system. The mascot who appears during breaks is Captain Infinity, who breaks the fourth wall.\nKCET produced Roger Fisher's The Advocates (1969\u20131984), Boboquivari (1970\u20131971), Leon Russell's Homewood Session (1970 TV Special), Meeting of Minds (1977\u20131981), Sid The Science Kid (2008-2013), and Artbound (2012\u2013).\nIn 1971, KCET began producing Hollywood Television Theater, TV movies directed by Norman Lloyd, Stacy Keach, Ivan Dixon, Lee Grant, and others. In 1976, KCET began producing Visions.\nIt produced the acclaimed Carl Sagan series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage from 1978 to 1979. KCET produced or presented The Cousteau Odyssey,  Trying Times, and the Hispanic family drama American Family for PBS. It was one of the consortium of stations that produced American Playhouse.\nTo commemorate the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, KCET produced a six-part miniseries in conjunction with the BBC called Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State.\nHuell Howser's California's Gold was produced at the KCET lot, until the series ended following Howser's death in 2013.\nKCET also produced the weeknight talk show Tavis Smiley and a PBS science show, Wired Science. A television program designed for care-givers, A Place of Our Own and its Spanish language equivalent, Los Ni\u00f1os en Su Casa are taped at the KCET studios, produced with a grant from BP.\nA few children's programs have also come from KCET\u2014Storytime, The Puzzle Place, Adventures from the Book of Virtues, The Charlie Horse Music Pizza, and Sid the Science Kid (the latter now airing on KOCE).\nKCET also produced California Connected, a television newsmagazine about various people, places and events throughout California, co-produced with KQED in San Francisco, KVIE in Sacramento, and KPBS in San Diego. This series ended its run in 2007 after five seasons.\n\nOn December 9, 2010, KCET announced its new program schedule after its disaffiliation from PBS in 2011. Programming included movies; travel, science, and drama programs, Britcoms and news programs, as the station maintains their relationship with program syndicators American Public Television and NETA, among others, which allow non-PBS stations to air their programming. Some of the programs that were announced and\/or continued on the new lineup include Globe Trekker, Rick Steves' Europe, Burt Wolf: Travels and Traditions, The Nature of Things with David Suzuki, The McLaughlin Group, Inside Washington, BBC World News, Keeping Up Appearances, As Time Goes By, Visiting With Huell Howser, and KCET's newsmagazine, SoCal Connected.\nKCET's 2012 schedule included Open Call a weekly series showcasing arts and culture in Southern California hosted by opera singer Suzanna Guzm\u00e1n; expansion of its interview program, LA Tonight with Roy Firestone; Your Turn to Care, a four-part documentary about caregivers hosted by Holly Robinson Peete; the BBC crime drama Inspector George Gently; the British ITV dramedy, Doc Martin; and Classic Cool Theater, a showcase of classic films, cartoons and newsreels.\nProgramming additions in 2015 included Moone Boy, Death in Paradise, Border Blaster, and Earth Focus.  Shows licensed on LinkTV that aired on KCET in 2014 including Arab Labor and Borgen are also part of the ongoing schedule. KCET added more programs a few years later such as Zula Patrol and Wunderkind Little Amadeus.\nCurrent original programming includes the history series Lost L.A., the arts series Artbound, and the food series Breaking Bread with chef-host Roy Choi.\nStarting in early 2019, KCET began integrating its originally-produced programming with that of KOCE's, including distribution of its programs on PBS' video platforms. In addition, KCET also began re-introducing PBS-distributed programming on its daily schedule in August 2019, including PBS NewsHour (which is aired live at 3 p.m. PT with the national 6 p.m. ET airing), Amanpour & Company, Nova, American Masters, and other notable news programs and documentaries commonly found on other PBS member stations.\n\nLife & Times\nLife & Times was a local news magazine and public affairs series produced by and broadcast on KCET from 1991 to 2007. \nIt was KCET's award-winning signature local program, and was hosted by Val Zavala. Co-hosts for Life & Times had included Patt Morrison, Hugh Hewitt, Rub\u00e9n Mart\u00ednez, Kerman Maddox, Errol St. Clair Smith, Jess Marlow, Warren Olney, and Jerry Nachman. \nOver its 16 years on the air, Life & Times covered major issues such as politics, education, the environment, demographics, transportation, science, culture and arts. It also offered viewers profile, features, and interviews with authors, community leaders, elected officials, educators, artists, activists, actors and scholars. While it was on air it won more than 25 L.A. Area Emmy awards, numerous Golden Mikes and many other awards.\n\nTechnical information\nSubchannels\nAnalog-to-digital conversion and spectrum incentive auction\nKCET began transmitting a digital television signal on UHF channel 59 in 2000. From that point until 2007, the majority of the programs (apart from most of those that aired during prime time) that were carried on KCET's main channel\u2014which, like most PBS stations that transmitted digital television signals during that time period, served as a designated high definition feed\u2014differed from the schedule maintained by its analog UHF channel 28 signal. It was simulcast on digital subchannel 28.2. In August 2007, programming from the main signal was integrated into the HD subchannel to accommodate for spectrum space, while at the same time preserving the integrity of the HD transmissions.\nThe station shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 28, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station's digital signal operated on a high-band UHF channel (in the 52\u201369 channel range) that was removed from broadcast use after the official June 12, 2009, transition date; as a result, KCET selected its former analog channel allocation on UHF channel 28 for its post-transition digital operations.\nOn September 10, 2014, it was announced that after negotiations with KLCS' licensee, the Los Angeles Unified School District, KCET and KLCS would consolidate their broadcast signals onto one over-the-air channel band, so the remaining wireless spectrum can be divested during the FCC's 2016 spectrum incentive auction. Both stations will retain separate licenses. Earlier in the year, KLCS had participated in a trial of channel sharing with KJLA.\n\nTranslators\nK04SB-D  Bakersfield\nK25QB-D  Lucerne Valley\nK09XW-D  Palm Desert, etc.\nK35LA-D  Palm Springs\nK16FC-D  San Luis Obispo\nK33QS-D  Santa Barbara, etc.\nK26FT-D  Santa Barbara\nK23OM-D  Victorville\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website","119":"KTLA (channel 5) is a television station in Los Angeles, California, United States, serving as the West Coast flagship of The CW. It is the largest directly owned property of the network's majority owner, Nexstar Media Group, and is the second-largest operated property after WPIX in New York City. KTLA's studios are located at the Sunset Bronson Studios on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, and its transmitter is located atop Mount Wilson.\nKTLA was the first commercially licensed television station in the western United States, having begun operations in January 1947. Although not as widespread in national carriage as its Chicago sister station WGN-TV, KTLA is available as a superstation via DirecTV and Dish Network (the latter service available only to grandfathered subscribers that had purchased its a la carte superstation tier before Dish halted sales of the package to new subscribers in September 2013), as well as on cable providers in select cities within the southwestern United States and throughout Canada.\nAs of 2015, KTLA operates an internet-only news radio channel on iHeartRadio.\n\nHistory\nExperimental years\nThe station was licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1939 as experimental station W6XYZ, broadcasting on VHF channel 4; it did not sign on the air until September 1942. The station was originally owned by Paramount Pictures subsidiary Television Productions, Inc., and was based at the Paramount Studios lot. Klaus Landsberg, already an accomplished television pioneer at the age of 26, was the original station manager and engineer.\n\nEarly years as a commercially licensed station\nOn January 22, 1947, the station was licensed for commercial broadcasting as KTLA on channel 5, becoming the first commercial television station in California, the first in the city of Los Angeles, the first to broadcast west of the Mississippi River, and the eighth commercial television station in the United States. Estimates of television sets in Los Angeles County at the time ranged from 350 to 600, since experimental station W6XAO (later KTSL and KNXT, now KCBS-TV) was already in operation broadcasting with a regular schedule. Bob Hope served as the emcee for KTLA's inaugural broadcast, titled as The Western Premiere of Commercial Television, which was broadcast live that evening from a garage on the Paramount Studios lot and featured appearances from many Hollywood luminaries. Hope delivered what was perhaps the most famous line of the telecast when, at the program's start, he identified the new station as \"KTL\" \u2013 mistakenly omitting the \"A\" at the end of the call sign. A 10-minute fragment from KTLA's first broadcast exists at the Paley Center for Media.\nKTLA was originally affiliated with the DuMont Television Network, of which Paramount held a minority stake; it disaffiliated from the network in 1948 and converted into an independent station. Despite this, the FCC still considered Paramount as controlling manager of DuMont due to the strength of the company's voting stock and their influence in managing the network. As a result, the agency did not allow DuMont to buy additional VHF stations\u2014a problem that would later play a large role in the failure of DuMont, whose programming was splintered among other Los Angeles stations\u2014including KTSL, KHJ-TV (channel 9, now KCAL-TV), KTTV (channel 11) and KCOP-TV (channel 13)\u2014until the network's demise in 1956. Paramount even launched a short-lived programming service, the Paramount Television Network, in 1948, with KTLA and WBKB-TV (now WBBM-TV) in Chicago serving as its flagship stations. The service never gelled into a true television network, but during KTLA's early years, the station produced over a dozen series that were syndicated in much of the U.S., including Armchair Detective, Bandstand Revue, Dixie Showboat, Frosty Frolics, Hollywood Reel, Hollywood Wrestling, Latin Cruise, Movietown, RSVP, Olympic Wrestling, Sandy Dreams, and Time for Beany.\nIn 1958, KTLA moved its operations into the Paramount Sunset Studios on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood. For many years, those who have worked on Stage 6 at KTLA were told that it was the site where Al Jolson's landmark film The Jazz Singer was shot in 1927, when the lot was known as the Warner Bros. Sunset Studios; Mark Evanier, who wrote for one such show in 1978, points out on his website that Stage 6 did not even exist at the time that The Jazz Singer was produced and that it was actually probably filmed at what is now Stage 9. The former Warner Bros.\/Paramount lot is now known as Sunset Bronson Studios, where KTLA's facility remains based to this day, and where shows such as WKRP in Cincinnati, Judge Judy, Hannah Montana, The Gong Show, Solid Gold, Name That Tune, Family Feud, The Newlywed Game, MADtv and Let's Make a Deal have been produced over the years. KTLA is currently the only Los Angeles area broadcaster that remains based in Hollywood as many other television and radio stations have moved to other parts of the region.\nKTLA has the distinction as being the first news station to use a helicopter as a news broadcasting platform. KTLA engineer John D. Silva pioneered the use of a Bell 47G-2 outfitted with transmitters to relay live breaking news back to the KTLA transmitter receiver on Mount Wilson to scoop their competitors, making their first successful in-flight broadcast on July 4, 1958.\n\nGolden West Broadcasters ownership\nIn November 1963, KTLA was purchased by actor and singer Gene Autry for $12 million; upon the sale's finalization in May 1964, Autry merged the station with his other broadcasting properties, including KMPC radio (710 AM, now KSPN) into an umbrella company known as Golden West Broadcasters. During the 1970s, KTLA was uplinked to satellite and became one of the nation's first superstations; the station was eventually carried on cable providers across much of the United States located west of the Mississippi River.\nKTLA sought a different programming strategy from its competitors during the late 1960s and 1970s, emphasizing syndicated reruns of off-network hour long dramas with a heavy emphasis on western-themed programs such as The Gene Autry Show, Bonanza, The Big Valley, first-run talk shows, movies and sports programming. Children's programs, with the exception of weekend morning Popeye cartoons (which originally came from former parent Paramount, but had been sold off to what became the syndication arm of United Artists Television), were also phased out. Popeye continued Sunday Mornings but with only the 1960s King Features episodes. Later in the 1970s more drama shows like Kung Fu, Wonder Woman and Starsky & Hutch were added. In 1979, KTLA acquired much of the programming inventory of struggling independent competitor KBSC-TV (channel 52, now Telemundo owned-and-operated station KVEA) including The Little Rascals, The Three Stooges, The Munsters, The Addams Family, Gilligan's Island, Leave It to Beaver, among others. These shows ran weekend mornings and weekend early afternoons. In 1979, KTLA acquired Happy Days, in 1981 Laverne & Shirley, Little House on the Prairie, in 1982 Taxi, and CHiPs, among other shows. The station continued to emphasize hour long dramas during the day on weekdays but began to run recent sitcoms in the evenings.\n\nTribune Broadcasting ownership\nIn November 1982, Golden West sold KTLA to investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts for $245 million. In May 1985, KKR sold the station to Chicago-based Tribune Broadcasting, for a then-record price of $510 million, which beat the station's earlier record sale price set by the 1982 acquisition by KKR. Under Tribune, KTLA continued to acquire high rated off-network sitcoms as well as talk shows for its schedule.\nKTLA became an affiliate of the MGM\/UA Premiere Network, a film-based ad hoc television network, with the showing of Clash of the Titans. The station added the syndicated Action Pack programming block to its schedule starting in mid-January 1994.\nKTLA spent much of the early and mid-1980s battling KTTV (channel 11) for the spot of the top-rated independent station in Southern California, offering a variety of general entertainment programs including movies, sports and off-network reruns; it took the top spot among the market's independents full-time after KTTV became a Fox charter station upon that network's start-up in October 1986. The station stayed out of the kids' business throughout the 1980s, unlike other Tribune stations but acquired stronger programming like Charles in Charge, Full House, Cheers, Punky Brewster, and Silver Spoons. The station also mixed in a few classic sitcoms weekday early mornings as well as on weekends. In the summer of 1991, the station debuted a two-hour weekday morning newscast. Sitcoms ran on the station 9 a.m. to noon weekdays.\n\nWB affiliation\nOn November 2, 1993, the Warner Bros. Television division of Time Warner and the Tribune Company announced the formation of The WB Television Network. Due to the company's ownership interest in the network (initially a 12.5% stake, later expanding to 22%), Tribune signed its seven existing independent stations (one such station, Atlanta's WGNX, joined CBS instead one month prior to The WB's launch), along with an eighth that the company had acquired the following year, to serve as The WB's charter affiliates. With this, KTLA became a network affiliate for the first time in 47 years when The WB launched on January 11, 1995.\nLike with other WB-affiliated stations during the network's first four years, KTLA initially continued to essentially program as a de facto independent station as The WB had broadcast only a two-hour prime time schedule on Wednesday nights at the network's launch; the station continued to broadcast films in prime time along with some first-run syndicated scripted series on nights when network programs did not air. The WB would eventually carry prime time shows six nights a week (Sunday through Friday) by September 1999. In September 1995, KTLA added afternoon cartoons and Saturday morning cartoons from the network's newly launched Kids' WB block, bringing weekday children's programs back to channel 5 for the first time in close to 25 years. The station continued use the \"Channel 5\" brand it used prior to its WB affiliation (with The WB logo simply tacked onto the station's \"Gold 5\" logo) until 1997, when the station overhauled its on-air branding to \"KTLA 5, L.A.'s WB\".\nThe Tribune Company purchased the Times Mirror Company (then-owners of the Los Angeles Times) in 2000, bringing the newspaper into common ownership with channel 5; ironically, the Los Angeles Times was the original owner of Fox owned-and-operated station KTTV from 1949 (under a joint venture with CBS through 1951) until it sold the station to Metromedia (successor to DuMont's owned and operated stations) in 1963 (that company would eventually become Fox Television Stations upon Metromedia's 1986 merger with News Corporation); as FCC rules prohibited the common ownership of newspapers and broadcast outlets in the same market, Tribune filed for and was granted a waiver by the agency to acquire the Times. The Times and KTLA were separated on August 4, 2014, when Tribune spun off its publishing division into a separate company; KTLA and Tribune's other broadcasting properties (as well as its Media Services and real estate units) remained with the original company, which was renamed as the Tribune Media Company.\nKTLA unveiled a new branding campaign on January 1, 2005, that omitted all references to its over-the-air channel 5 position (although the references returned after the station became a CW affiliate one year later). The new look included a modernized logo with a halo emblem over the KTLA calls and WB logo, and a change in branding to KTLA, The WB.\n\nCW affiliation\nOn January 24, 2006, the Warner Bros. unit of Time Warner (now Warner Bros. Discovery) and CBS Corporation (now Paramount Global) announced that the two companies would shut down The WB and UPN and combine the networks' respective programming to create a new \"fifth\" network called The CW. With the announcement, Tribune Broadcasting signed ten-year agreements for KTLA and 16 of the company's 18 other WB-affiliated stations (three of which it would sell to other groups shortly before The CW launched including WLVI, WATL, and WCWN) to become charter affiliates of The CW. The station changed its branding to \"KTLA 5, The CW\" on September 17, 2006, immediately after the airing of The WB's final broadcast, The Night of Favorites and Farewells.\n\nOn January 22, 2007, KTLA celebrated its 60th anniversary of continuous broadcasting. Two days later, on January 24, 2007, KTLA became the first television entity to be honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In addition to the station itself, six other individuals associated with KTLA\u2014former owner Gene Autry, newsmen Hal Fishman, George Putnam, Stan Chambers and Larry McCormick, and founding manager Klaus Landsberg\u2014have received stars on the Walk of Fame. In addition, KTLA continued its celebration on the weekend after Thanksgiving with a 60-hour marathon of classic shows that aired on KTLA in the past such as The Honeymooners, The Jack Benny Program, The Little Rascals, Wonder Woman and Peter Gunn. KTLA also aired retrospectives of historic Los Angeles news stories during its weekend evening newscasts, but was not aired on November 24 due to coverage of the Corral Canyon fire in Malibu.\nOn February 14, 2008, the Tribune Company sold Tribune Studios and related real estate in Los Angeles to equity firm Hudson Capital LLC for $125 million, with the studio lot being renamed Sunset Bronson Studios following the sale. There had been speculation that KTLA would move into the Los Angeles Times Building in downtown Los Angeles, combining operations and staff with the Times newspaper; this arrangement is also used by two other Tribune combined newspaper-broadcast operations: Miami's WSFL-TV is based in the offices of former sister newspaper Sun-Sentinel, while the Hartford duopoly of WTIC-TV\/WTXX moved into new facilities in the Hartford Courant building in December 2009.\nOn October 14, 2009, KTLA unveiled a new logo and a redesigned news set, bringing back the classic stylized number \"5\" that was previously used by the station from 1981 to 1997, and eliminating The CW's logo from regular usage (though it is still used in promotions for the network's programs). The \"LA\" in the KTLA callsign is rendered in bold lettering to emphasize the station's Los Angeles location and coverage area, similar to a previous wordmark logo used from 1997 to 2005.\n\nAborted sale to Sinclair and sale to Nexstar\nSinclair Broadcast Group entered into an agreement to acquire Tribune Media on May 8, 2017, for $3.9 billion, plus the assumption of $2.7 billion in Tribune debt. The prospect of Sinclair acquiring KTLA was met with consternation among station employees, due to concerns over the influence the company might have on the station's news content. Sinclair has been known for requiring its stations to run news reports and commentaries that reflect a conservative perspective; the city of Los Angeles and some adjacent and outlying suburbs are predominately liberal, while some outlying areas elsewhere in the market (including portions of Orange County) lean conservative. The deal received significant scrutiny over Sinclair's forthrightness in its applications to sell certain conflict properties, prompting the FCC to designate it for hearing and leading Tribune to terminate the deal and sue Sinclair for breach of contract.\nFollowing the Sinclair deal's collapse, Nexstar Media Group of Irving, Texas, announced its purchase of Tribune Media on December 3, 2018, for $6.4 billion in cash and debt. The sale was completed on September 19, 2019.\nNexstar renewed their affiliation deal with The CW on May 20, 2021, which covered the company's then-37 CW-affiliated stations in many media markets, including KTLA.\n\nProgramming\nKTLA clears the entire CW schedule, although since the expansion of its Saturday morning newscast in May 2014, it has aired the network's children's block\u2014currently known as One Magnificent Morning\u2014three hours later (from 10 a.m. to 3 pm) than the network's other Pacific Time Zone affiliates until September 30, 2017. From October 7 to December 30, 2017, the station aired the OMM block locally on a two-hour delayed basis from 10 a.m. to 1 pm. On January 6, 2018, the station began airing the OMM block again on a three-hour delayed basis, this time from 11 a.m. to 2 pm, due to the expansion of its weekend morning newscast to five hours. Until the network returned the weekday hour of programming to its affiliates in September 2021, the station also aired The CW Daytime reruns of the syndicated talk show The Jerry Springer Show at 2 p.m.\u2014one hour earlier than the network's recommended timeslot at 3 p.m.\u2014due to its 3 p.m. newscast (a scheduling inherited from The Bill Cunningham Show after KTLA displaced the program from its network-dictated timeslot following the launch of its mid-afternoon newscast in December 2014 and, most recently, The Robert Irvine Show).\nThroughout the film and television awards seasons, as KTLA is unassociated with an entity owning a film or television studio or streaming service, those entities will often purchase the hours before prime time on KTLA to present \"for your consideration\" programs regarding their series or films, often behind-the-scenes looks and interviews with acting nominees for the interest of awards voters. The station is also a part of Nexstar's statewide network when KTLA or another California Nexstar station originates a political debate for statewide office.\nKTLA has also broadcast the annual Tournament of Roses Parade from Pasadena each New Year's Day since 1948; while other local stations have also broadcast the parade over the years, KTLA remains the sole English-language outlet in the Los Angeles market to continuously broadcast the event. The station also served as host broadcaster of the Hollywood Christmas Parade, which was later syndicated to all Tribune-owned stations and the Hallmark Channel, a role it resumed in 2015 when The CW received the national broadcast rights. KTLA also broadcasts the San Diego Big Bay Boom July 4 fireworks show, with coverage produced by sister station KSWB-TV.\n\nSports programming\nKTLA serves as the over-the-air home of the Los Angeles Clippers, broadcasting 15 preseason and regular season games starting in the 2022\u201323 season. The station had earlier carried the team from 1985 to 1991 and from 2002 to 2009.\nFrom 1964 to 1995, KTLA served as the broadcast television home of the Los Angeles\/California Angels baseball team, after then-Angels owner Gene Autry purchased the station through Golden West Broadcasters. The television rights to Angels games moved to KCAL-TV in 1996 (which KTLA had previously assumed broadcast rights from, and whose then-owner The Walt Disney Company's ownership interest in the Angels briefly overlapped with KCAL's contract with the team).\nKTLA served as the local over-the-air television broadcaster rights to Los Angeles Dodgers baseball games from 1993 to 2001. The station would return to its over-the-air relationship with the Dodgers on September 2, 2016, when KTLA entered into an agreement with Charter Communications (which had acquired Time Warner Cable's Southern California systems earlier that year through its acquisition of the latter cable provider) to simulcast six regular season games scheduled for the final two weeks of the 2016 season to which regional sports network SportsNet LA already held rights to broadcast through its contract with the Dodgers. This arrangement would extend into the following year, when on March 8, 2017, SportsNet LA agreed to simulcast ten Dodgers games scheduled during the first and last five weeks of the 2017 regular season on KTLA. The original decision for the simulcasting arrangement was made after complaints were raised that fans would not be able to watch the final broadcasts of retiring legendary commentator Vin Scully, since SportsNet LA's availability in Southern California is primarily limited to Charter Spectrum systems because of disagreements between Charter\/TWC and five major television providers serving the region (Cox Communications, Frontier FiOS, AT&T U-verse, DirecTV and Dish Network) over transmission rates that have prevented them from agreeing to carry the channel. Channel 5 would continue this arrangement with SportsNet LA since  the 2018 season.\nKTLA also carried selected Los Angeles Lakers road games from 1967 to 1977, and as well as selected Los Angeles Kings road games during that same time period (and again selected telecasts during the majority of the Wayne Gretzky era in the late 1980s to mid 1990s). Other than telecasts of preseason games from the Las Vegas Raiders (who were based in Los Angeles from 1982 until the team returned to Oakland in 1994) syndicated by the Las Vegas Silver and Black Network, along with a 30-minute show each weekend during the regular season before the game, KTLA does produce one sporting event each year, the LA Marathon, which features many of the Morning News on-air staff, along with running specialists on a Sunday morning in February\/March of each year.\n\nNews operation\nKTLA presently broadcasts 94 hours, 20 minutes of locally produced newscasts each week (with 15 hours, 20 minutes each weekday; 8 hours, 20 minutes on Saturdays and 9 hours, 20 minutes on Sundays); in regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the highest newscast output among television stations in California and in the United States as a whole. KTLA produces a 15-minute sports wrap-up show every night at 10:45 pm, during KTLA 5 News at 10:00; produces a 30-minute show, KTLA 5 Sports Final, on the weekends at 11:35 p.m. after KTLA 5 News at 11:00.\nKTLA's news department is located inside the former Warner Bros. Cartoons studio (known as the Hal Fishman Newsroom since 2000) at the corner of Van Ness and Fernwood in Hollywood. Although KTLA does not cover police pursuits as much as other stations, it has put more emphasis in local crime stories, as opposed to politics, health and other serious news. KTLA had created synergy between Tribune Company entities. For example, entertainment reporter Sam Rubin would often be featured in addition to his KTLA work as the main Los Angeles-based entertainment reporter for Chicago sister station WGN-TV. Los Angeles Times columnist David Lazarus also reported on consumer stories from the paper's headquarters in El Segundo, before switching full time to KTLA in 2022.\nFor many years, Channel 5's news department, which has existed since its sign-on, was considered the benchmark of Los Angeles television. In 1958, KTLA began operating a well-equipped helicopter for newsgathering known as the \"Telecopter\", and was the most advanced airborne television broadcast device of its time; it was ultimately sold to NBC-owned KNBC (channel 4), which flew the Telecopter with pilot Francis Gary Powers and cameraman George Spears until it crashed on August 1, 1977, killing the two on board.\nDuring the early 1960s, under the final years of ownership under Paramount Pictures, KTLA launched am:LA, a one-hour morning news program anchored by Stan Chambers, and with it, it was the first extended morning newscast in Southern California. Before eventually launching a 10 p.m. newscast in 1965, originally titled Newscene (also known over the years as The George Putnam News, NewsWatch, Channel 5\/KTLA News at Ten and KTLA Prime News), KTLA had its weeknight evening newscasts airing at 7 and 11 pm, with the latter in direct competition with the network-owned local newscasts on KNXT (now KCBS-TV), KRCA-TV (now KNBC) and KABC-TV. Traditionally, the evening news programs are often serious and no-nonsense in nature and has received many journalism awards. Putnam and fellow KTLA news anchors Hal Fishman and Larry McCormick became icons in Los Angeles television news over the years. Accompanying his news anchoring career, McCormick also hosted Making It!, a public affairs program on the station which featured stories on the entrepreneurial successes of ethnic minorities. Its veteran field reporters have included 62-year KTLA veteran Stan Chambers and Warren Wilson. Stu Nahan, Keith Olbermann and Ed Arnold (former anchor of KOCE-TV's Real Orange) formerly served as sports anchors.\nIn March 1991, KTLA was the first station to air the infamous video of Rodney King's beating by three Los Angeles police officers, whose eventual acquittal sparked rioting within the city in 1992. In July 1991, KTLA debuted the Los Angeles market's first live, local morning two-hour newscast, the KTLA Morning News, to compete with the network morning shows on KABC-TV (channel 7), KCBS-TV (channel 2) and KNBC (which each started at 7 am, as KTLA's program initially did). The program suffered from low ratings at first; however, the ability to cover breaking news live (as opposed to the network morning programs, which were aired on a three-hour tape delay) attracted more viewers to the program. As time went on, the Morning News has enjoyed great ratings success, generally ranking number one in its main 7\u20139 a.m. time period. The program's success spawned rival KTTV to launch its own morning newscast, Good Day L.A., in 1993. From 1994 to 1995, the station aired gavel to gavel coverage of the O. J. Simpson trial anchored by Marta Waller (this coverage was rebroadcast by other stations such as Portland, Oregon WB affiliate [and future Tribune sister station] KWBP (now KRCW-TV)).\nThe station debuted a midday newscast at noon in 1995, which later moved to 11 a.m. the following year, which lasted less than two years before it was canceled in 1997. In recent years, KTLA's newscasts have become more tabloid-based in nature, perhaps to compete with KTTV (both stations have rivaled each other in the ratings for many years). With this, KTLA has placed more emphasis on entertainment news and has featured personalities such as Mindy Burbano Stearns, Zorianna Kitt, Ross King and most recently Jessica Holmes as entertainment reporters. In 2004, KTLA debuted a segment on its morning newscast titled \"The Audition\", in which several actors and actresses competed for a role as weathercaster on its 10 p.m. newscast. King won the first installment, followed by Holmes as the winner of the second installment (Holmes now serves as co-anchor of the 7\u201311 a.m. weekday block of the KTLA Morning News).\nOn January 13, 2007, KTLA became the second television station in the Los Angeles market (after KABC-TV) to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. On July 30, 2007, Hal Fishman anchored what would be his final newscast for KTLA. Following several days of hospitalization for a liver infection, Fishman died on August 7, 2007. KTLA's newscasts that day were dedicated to Fishman, for whom the station dedicated its news studio in 2000. After Fishman's passing, longtime Morning Show co-host Carlos Amezcua became the interim co-anchor on the 10 p.m. newscast. Local media speculated that Amezcua would be named full-time anchor of the prime time newscast; however, on September 4, Amezcua announced his departure from KTLA to replace John Beard as co-anchor of KTTV's 10 p.m. newscast. Morning co-anchor Emmett Miller took over as interim evening anchor and was named as Fishman's permanent replacement on December 4.\nAfter former KCBS\/KCAL general manager Don Corsini was appointed as KTLA's president and general manager in January 2009, the station spearheaded an expansion of its news programming that year. On January 19, KTLA soft-launched a nightly half-hour 6:30 p.m. newscast (the market's first since KCAL-TV and KCBS-TV ran newscasts in that slot \u2013 KCBS's being part of an hour-long 6 p.m. newscast \u2013 during the mid-1990s, prior to CBS's 2002 purchase of KCAL). Then on April 1, 2009, the KTLA Morning News was expanded by a half-hour to start at 4:30 a.m. and an hour-long midday newscast at 1 p.m. debuted. On April 4, the weekend edition of the 6:30 p.m. newscast expanded to a full hour at 6 pm, with the 6:30 p.m. weekday newscasts following suit that September. Shortly afterward, KTLA expanded the station's traffic reports to the afternoon and evening newscasts (the weekday edition of the Morning News uses a dedicated traffic anchor, while traffic reports for all other newscasts are done by channel 5's on-air weather staff).\nIn April 2011, KTLA added weekend morning newscasts (an hour-long newscast at 6 a.m. on Saturdays, which expanded to two hours at 5 a.m. in September 2012 and a three-hour Sunday newscast at 6 am; the Saturday morning edition aired in the earlier timeslot due to The CW's Vortexx animation block). In August 2011, KTLA added a two-hour prime time newscast titled the KTLA 5 Sunday Edition from 8 to 10 p.m. on Sunday evenings, leading into that night's 10 p.m. newscast (the 8 p.m. hour of the program was later dropped in September 2013, while the 9 p.m. hour moved to 7 p.m. on October 7, 2018, to accommodate the return of The CW's Sunday night two-hour prime time block). On February 2, 2012, KTLA expanded the weekday edition of the KTLA Morning News to begin at 4 a.m.\nOn May 9, 2014, the Saturday morning newscast was expanded to three hours and moved to 6\u20139 a.m., in a uniform timeslot as the Sunday morning newscast, causing The CW's children's program block at the time, Vortexx, to be aired to a two-hour tape delay (that broadcast expanded to four hours from 6 to 10 a.m. on August 6, 2016, further aligning it with the prior expansion of the Sunday morning newscast into the same four-hour slot on July 5, 2015, and pushing the successor One Magnificent Morning block back by an additional hour). The following month on June 16, KTLA quietly \"soft launched\" a half-hour nightly newscast at 11 p.m. without any promotion (becoming Tribune's first news-producing CW affiliate to carry a newscast in the traditional late news timeslot), its first regularly-scheduled 11 pm newscast since 1965.\nOn December 26, 2014, KTLA added separate hour-long, weekday afternoon newscasts at 2 and 3 pm. The creation of the three-hour mid-afternoon news block\u2014which expanded upon the existing 1 p.m. newscast\u2014was in response to CBS Television Stations' December 10 announcement that it would discontinue KCAL-TV's newscasts at 2 and 3 p.m. late that month to refocus newsgathering resources towards KCAL's 4 p.m. newscast and the respective evening newscasts on KCAL and sister station KCBS-TV. While the 3 p.m. broadcast was a permanent addition, the 2 p.m. newscast was intended as a temporary fill-in that ran until December 31, 2014 (it was replaced two days later on January 2, 2015, by a double-run of Celebrity Name Game). In July 2015, KTLA became the first television station in Los Angeles to carry live audio simulcasts of its newscasts on the iHeartRadio app.\nOn June 12, 2017, KTLA expanded the weekday edition of the KTLA 5 Morning News to 11 am.\nOn January 6, 2018, KTLA expanded the weekend edition of the KTLA 5 Morning News to 11 am.\nOn May 1, 2018, KTLA debuted an hour long newscast at 11 am.\nOn October 7, 2018, KTLA moved its Sunday Edition up two hours earlier to 7 p.m. due to The CW adding prime time programming on Sundays.\nOn December 27, 2018, KTLA Weekend News anchor and reporter, Chris Burrous, was found unconscious from a methamphetamine overdose in a Days Inn hotel room in Glendale, California. He was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital.\nOn January 12, 2019, KTLA began producing a weekend 30-minute edition of KTLA 5 Sports Final at 11:35 pm after the 11 p.m. newscast.\nOn February 9, 2019, KTLA added a new hour-long 5 p.m. weekend newscast.\nOn September 21, 2020, KTLA added a new hour-long 12 p.m. weekday newscast. The newscast had started months earlier due to the COVID-19 pandemic and became permanent on that day. Also on that day, the lifestyle show LA Unscripted debuted.\nOn May 3, 2021, KTLA launched Off the Clock, a program featuring the Morning News team in a more relaxed environment, on streaming. Subsequently with the ending of Maury, Off the Clock was brought to broadcast airing at 2 p.m.\nOn October 4, 2021, KTLA added a new hour-long 5 p.m. weekday newscast.\nOn February 20, 2023, KTLA added a new hour-long 4 p.m. weekday newscast. Including LA Unscripted, KTLA runs continuous news and information programming from 4 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. on weekdays.\n\nControversies\nIn 1978, Arnold Shapiro's documentary Scared Straight! was broadcast on the station without edits for the film's profanity, narrated by Peter Falk as a controversial deterrent to juvenile delinquency.\nIn 2004, People and Hollywood Reporter entertainment writer Zorianna Kit was hired as an on-air reporter despite having no television news experience (Kit had previously served as a panelist on the short-lived television series Movie Club with John Ridley). Kit raised ethical questions in January 2005 when she made an on-air criticism of Brad Grey's appointment as the head of Paramount Pictures, without disclosing that her husband, producer Bo Zenga, had sued Grey over profits from the film Scary Movie. The issue was reported in the Los Angeles Times and in mid-January, Kit apologized on-air; she left KTLA in July 2005.\nIn January 2006, KTLA management came under fire for replacing Stephanie Edwards, who emceed the Tournament of Roses Parade for nearly three decades, with Bob Eubanks, as co-host of the station's annual broadcast of the parade. Edwards was moved out of the booth and became a street reporter, being replaced in the booth by Michaela Pereira. The move was widely seen as insensitive and created a storm of controversy, including a scathing Times column by Patt Morrison. This situation was made worse because it was raining that day, and Edwards was forced to stay outside near the parade route. Pereira fully replaced Edwards in 2007, though in September 2008, KTLA management announced that Edwards would resume co-hosting duties with Eubanks for the parade's 2009 telecast.\nIn February 2006, the Pasadena Star-News reported that anchors Carlos Amezcua and Michaela Pereira, and entertainment reporter Sam Rubin, had accepted free rooms at the recently renovated Ritz-Carlton Huntington Hotel and Spa in Pasadena. The station telecast an entire Morning News episode from Pasadena, although the hotel was not specifically mentioned. Still, it was widely seen as a significant ethical lapse, one that violated Tribune Company guidelines.\nOn March 4, 2006, the Times reported that Michaela Pereira had accepted $10,000 worth of furniture for her Pasadena home. The furnishings, delivered in September 2005, were to be part of an unaired \"Extreme Home Makeover\" segment on the Morning News. The furniture company was never paid, stating that it was under the impression that the work was in exchange for favorable coverage.\nIn June 2009, the Los Angeles Times reported that anchor Lu Parker began a relationship with Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa in March of that year. KTLA management was reportedly unaware of this until May 2009. Parker reported several stories on Villaraigosa's political future before being reassigned.\nDuring a live interview on February 10, 2014, entertainment reporter Sam Rubin got a \"shellacking\" by actor Samuel L. Jackson after Rubin confused him with Laurence Fishburne in an opening reference to \"the Super Bowl commercial\". While Rubin promptly apologized and later suggested that he was referring to a different commercial, Rubin received heavy criticism from Jackson for mixing him up with \"the other black guy\" \u2013 in an outrage over purported racial 'in-discrimination'. Jackson also referred to other examples on Twitter.\nIn September 2022, long-time news anchor Lynette Romero left the station for a weekday morning news position at cross-town rival KNBC. Romero was given the opportunity to say goodbye to viewers, but decided to take vacation time through the end of her contract. Instead, entertainment reporter Sam Rubin told viewers she was leaving the station. The following weekend, Romero's co-anchor Mark Mester delivered a four-minute monologue in which he apologized on behalf of the station for its \"inappropriate\" remarks about Romero's departure. Mester was suspended for the comments; the station ultimately fired him. The incident prompted a severe backlash against KTLA and its management over the handling of Romero's departure and the subsequent firing of Mester.\n\nNotable current on-air staff\nGayle Anderson \u2013 reporter\nWendy Burch \u2013 reporter\nCher Calvin \u2013 anchor\nDayna Devon \u2013 reporter; also host of LA Unscripted\nCourtney Friel \u2013 anchor and general assignment reporter\nSteve Hartman \u2013 sports anchor\nJessica Holmes \u2013 anchor\nDerrin Horton \u2013 sports director\nLauren Lyster \u2013 general assignment reporter\nMicah Ohlman \u2013 anchor\nLu Parker \u2013 anchor\n\nNotable former on-air staff\nTechnical information\nSubchannels\nThe station's signal is multiplexed:\n\nAnalog-to-digital conversion\nKTLA, in the tradition of television pioneering successes, was an FCC volunteer \"early adopter\" HD station. On October 28, 1998, KTLA-DT signed on with the West Coast's first commercially broadcast high definition programming. It was on UHF channel 31 in 1080i 16:9 format. Frank Geraty was the KTLA Director of Broadcast Operations and Engineering, and Ira Goldstone was the Corporate VP of Engineering. At precisely 9 am, VIP Milton Berle threw the ceremonial \"Transmit On\" switch, as he did at the Chicago World's Fair in 1939 at the birth of analog television broadcasting. The modern day event took place during KTLA's signature morning news broadcast and KTLA HD programming began simultaneously transmitting for the first time along with its analog channel. KTLA-DT went on to do the first HD Rose Parade and the first HD Dodgers baseball game broadcasts in the several months that followed.\nKTLA ended regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 5, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 31, using virtual channel 5.\nVeteran newsman Stan Chambers, who was hired by KTLA almost a year after its 1947 launch and remained with the station until his retirement in 2010, was given the honor of \"throwing\" a ceremonial mock switch from the analog to digital position, signaling the engineers to shut down the analog signal at its Mount Wilson transmitter site at 10:45 pm, during KTLA's Prime News telecast. Covering the on-air event for KTLA was Stan's grandson, reporter Jaime Chambers. As part of the SAFER Act, KTLA temporarily restored its analog signal 15 minutes later at 11 p.m. to inform viewers of the digital television transition through a loop of public service announcements from the National Association of Broadcasters, which ran until June 26, 2009. It was one of four local stations (alongside KCBS-TV, KNBC, and KWHY-TV) to offer this service.\n\nSpectrum auction repack\nKTLA was one of nearly 1,000 television stations that changed their digital signal allocation in the spectrum auction repack of late 2017 or early 2018. The station reallocated to UHF channel 35 in phase two of the auction. The spectrum change took place on March 18, 2019.\n\nTranslators\nK29NN-D  Lucerne Valley\nK30GU-D  Morongo Valley\nK27NX-D  Ridgecrest\nK15FC-D  Twentynine Palms\n\nSee also\nLos Angeles portal\n Television portal\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nwww.ktla.antennatv.tv \u2013 KTLA-DT2 (\"Antenna TV Los Angeles\") official website\n\"Look Out, W6XAO, Here Comes Paramount\" Metropolitan News-Enterprise column on KTLA when it broadcast as experimental TV station W6XYZ, taking on the sole existing experimental station in L.A.

This creates some amount of tension between him and his friends, who have been losing their interest in racing and have been attempting to make serious inroads in the music industry. Steve's blossoming relationship with singer Tina (Deborah Van Valkenburgh) causes him to re-think his mantra, as he realizes that a truly fulfilling life involves more than just work and play.\nThe film was poorly regarded critically and did not perform well in the box office, although it was significant in being among the first films about street racing and communities of street racers, as well as because it was inspired by the activities of real people who raced in the Los Angeles area. It also marked somewhat of a return for Dennis Hopper, who had spent several months secluded away from Los Angeles prior to making his appearance.\n\nPlot\nSteve (Harry Hamlin) works at a Porsche repair garage by day and by night reigns as the \"King of The Mountain\", the most successful and talented of a group that organize, wager on and participate in races up and down the narrow, winding roads of Mulholland Drive in the hills on the edge of the San Fernando Valley. In his highly tuned 356 Speedster, Steve races against both newcomers and veterans alike, never really considering the risks associated with the lifestyle or if there might be more for him elsewhere.\nSteve's friends Buddy (Joseph Bottoms) and Roger (Richard Cox) want to get into the music industry, and although they once raced alongside Steve, their focus has shifted away from racing in favor of their potential careers, leaving Steve to reign as King alone, racing night after night for the thrills, but without much of the joy he once got from the racing. Aside from wanting the thrill, Steve is egged on by Cal (Dennis Hopper), a co-worker and the former King who reigned until a near-fatal accident destroyed his now aging, dilapidated Corvette and drove him over the edge mentally.\nWhen Steve meets Tina (Deborah Van Valkenburgh), a young singer working with Buddy and Roger, he quickly falls for her and tries to introduce her to the world of street racing, but finds that she isn't as enthralled with it as he is and isn't interested in returning to the races or in being involved with a man who is constantly risking his life for a thrill. Torn between Tina and his life as a racer, Steve must choose to either remain King, or abdicate and leave so that he can start over in \"real life\". All the while, Cal is secretly rebuilding his Corvette, and he wants a shot at winning his title back.\nThe film's climax depicts a dangerous, high speed race down the hill between Steve and Cal.\n\nBackground\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s small groups were racing on some of the narrow, steep, twisting and particularly dangerous portions of Mulholland in and near the Santa Monica Mountains as well as on nearby stretches of Laurel Canyon Boulevard, Coldwater Canyon, Nichols Canyon Road and other adjacent streets. This community of racers became notorious to the nearby canyon residents and later, to people all across the city. Light Police patrols were eventually increased into a full-force crackdown on racing in the area after complaints were fielded from the residents and accidents, sometimes resulting in death and\/or serious injury occurred. On a few occasions, Police were forced to chase suspected racers through the narrow roads, and were not always able to keep up, leading to a few \"escapes\" by the racers.\nDuring the late 1970s an article titled \"Thunder Road\" [1] appeared in an issue of New West Magazine, the article detailed some of what was going on in the canyon and made specific reference to two particular drivers; Chris Banning, who owned and raced a heavily modified Porsche 911 and Charles \"Crazy Charlie\" Woit, who owned and raced a vintage, 427 cubic-inch Big-Block powered Chevrolet Corvette. The article provided the inspiration for the film, and its two main characters, who were based on Banning and Woit.\nIn 2006, Chris Banning wrote a book entitled \"The Mulholland Experience\" detailing his experiences, what it was like being a part of that community, and being the inspiration for the film.\n\nProduction\nHarry Hamlin's Speedster was actually a modified Volkswagen Beetle based kit car wearing a replica body with flared fenders; actual Speedsters did not have the flares. This was done primarily because real Speedsters are very rare; it would have been difficult and expensive to locate a real one for rent and the possibility of damaging the vehicle was too great.\nDennis Hopper actually drove his character's Corvette on at least one instance to get footage for the film's climactic race. The vehicle was fitted with three compact Arri cameras, each with a three hundred foot roll of film installed and each connected to an in-cabin switch allowing Hopper to turn them on when he started and off when the film ran out. On the day the footage was to be shot, Hopper was reportedly very drunk; he had spent the day in his trailer drinking beer. Despite crew protests, director Noel Nosseck allowed Hopper to drive the car, and according to crew members he entered the car with a fresh six-pack. After taking off, he spent almost an hour in the vehicle, despite there being only enough film for a few minutes of footage, and returned with the six-pack empty.\n\nHome media\nThe film's only official home video release was a VHS format version available for a brief period during the 1980s. DVD copies of the film occasionally appear for sale on sites such as EBay, these are legal \"backup\" copies made from VHS cassettes.\nIn 2016, the film was officially released in the U.S. for Digital HD and Video On Demand and is available from digital retailers like iTunes and Amazon.\nKing of the Mountain was officially released on Blu-Ray on November 24, 2020. Bonus features include a 10 minute interview with Harry Hamlin and an interview with the director, Noel Nosseck.

It is owned and operated by the network's Fox Television Stations division alongside MyNetworkTV outlet KCOP-TV (channel 13). The two stations share studios at the Fox Television Center in West Los Angeles; KTTV's transmitter is located atop Mount Wilson.\n\nHistory\nEarly years (1947\u20131954)\nKTTV's origins can be traced to 1947, when the station's license and construction permit was secured by the Times Mirror Company, publishers of the Los Angeles Times. It was one of five licenses that were granted simultaneously by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to parties interested in expanding commercial television in Los Angeles. In 1948, CBS, which owned KNX radio, purchased a 49% interest in the station and assisted in completing its construction in exchange for making channel 11 the network's Los Angeles television outlet. KTTV began operations on January 1, 1949, and was operated initially by KTTV, Incorporated, the Times\/CBS-owned holding company. The station's first telecast was the Tournament of Roses Parade, which channel 11 would air every New Year's Day until 1995.\nIn May 1950, Times-Mirror purchased the Nassour Studios \u2013 a large motion picture facility on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, and centralized KTTV's operations there. CBS did not join Times-Mirror in the purchase; at the time its West Coast production facilities were based at Columbia Square, with its CBS Television City facility in the planning stages. KTTV converted the Nassour Studios into a major production house for television, producing programs locally and for the emerging syndication market. Prior to the move, KTTV operated out of several different facilities, including the former headquarters of Capitol Records (which was later the longtime home of KHJ radio and what is now KCAL-TV) on Melrose Avenue.\nLater in 1950, CBS chose to acquire its own station in Los Angeles \u2013 pioneer station KTSL (channel 2, renamed KNXT and now KCBS-TV) \u2013 which was being spun off by the Don Lee Broadcasting System as a result of its sale to General Tire and Rubber. The KTSL purchase forced CBS to divest its interest in KTTV due to FCC rules in effect at the time that barred the common ownership of two television stations in the same media market; the Los Angeles Times would regain full ownership of channel 11 when the sales were finalized on January 1, 1951. KTTV's relationship with CBS ended after exactly two years as the network moved its programming to KTSL. A few months later, channel 11 agreed to become the new Los Angeles outlet of the DuMont Television Network, which had been affiliated with KTSL, and before that KTLA (channel 5).\n\nIndependence (1954\u20131986)\nIn 1954, DuMont moved its programming to KHJ-TV (channel 9, now KCAL-TV), and KTTV became an independent station. During the late 1950s, the station was also briefly affiliated with the NTA Film Network. In 1958, channel 11 scored an advantage against its rivals when it became the television home of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team, which had relocated from Brooklyn, New York, that year. For the first 11 years and at the request of the team, KTTV's Dodger telecasts were limited to road games against the archrival San Francisco Giants. Eventually, the number of Dodger games broadcast on the station increased and the home game blackout was lifted; the relationship between KTTV and the Dodgers would last until the end of the 1992 season.\nThe show Confidential File on KTTV covered the 1962 convention of the Daughters of Bilitis and aired after Confidential File became syndicated nationally; this was probably the first American national broadcast that specifically covered lesbianism.\nThe Times-Mirror Company sold the station to Metromedia in 1963. Later that year, Metromedia purchased KLAC (570 AM) and the original KLAC-FM (102.7 FM, now KIIS-FM), giving channel 11 sister stations on the radio dial. Metromedia would later engineer a trade of FM frequencies, resulting in KLAC-FM moving to 94.7 FM (later to become KMET, now KTWV) in 1965.\nBy the 1970s, KTTV offered a traditional general entertainment schedule common among independent stations at the time, consisting of children's programs, off-network reruns, sports programming and old movies, along with a 10 p.m. newscast. Some of the staff members in the earlier 1970s were John Jones, Sales Manager; George Putnam, news anchorman; Putnam's co-anchor Hal Fishman; Ken Jones, first black on-air TV newsman in L.A.; Tom Kelly, TV sports reporter; Terry Mayo, noontime news; and Rona Barrett, who taped her syndicated gossip report at KTTV, written by assistant Barbara Sternig. With the evolution of cable television, KTTV became a regional superstation. Thanks to its Dodgers broadcasts and round-the-clock programming, KTTV was seen on various cable systems across the Western United States during the 1970s and into the 1980s, as far east as El Paso, Texas. KTLA, with its Angels broadcasts, also became a superstation. KTTV and KTLA were seen on most Southern and Central California cable systems, with KHJ-TV and KCOP also getting carried outside Los Angeles to a lesser extent.\nIn 1973, as part of an agreement signed with four citizen groups and filed with the station's renewal application, KTTV began banning 42 violent animated series, most notably Popeye, Superman, Batman and Aquaman, while applying a \"caution to parents\" warning to 81 violent live-action series which are shown before 8:30 p.m., most notably The Outer Limits.\n\nAs a Fox-owned station (1986\u2013present)\nIn 1986, Australian newspaper publisher Rupert Murdoch and his company, the News Corporation (which had acquired a controlling ownership interest in the 20th Century Fox film studio the year before), purchased KTTV and the other Metromedia television stations. The Metromedia stations ended up becoming part of a new holding company formed by News Corporation called Fox Television Stations; those stations formed the basis for the new Fox Broadcasting Company television network, which made its debut on October 9, 1986. Following the News Corporation purchase, KTTV added more first-run syndicated talk, court and reality shows. By the early 1990s, it began to run afternoon cartoons from the network's Fox Kids block (which debuted in 1990), as well as top-rated off-network sitcoms during the evening hours. KTTV removed cartoons on weekday mornings in June 1993, due to the launch of the morning newscast Good Day L.A.\nIn 2001, Fox Television Stations acquired several UPN affiliates owned by Chris-Craft Industries through its BHC Communications station group, creating a duopoly between KTTV and KCOP-TV (channel 13). That fall, channel 11 dropped the Fox Kids weekday block and moved it to KCOP; Fox Kids discontinued its weekday block altogether in January 2002, with the lineup left airing only on Saturday mornings. Since the 4Kids block was replaced by Fox with the infomercial block Weekend Marketplace in December 2008, the station now airs five hours of educational programming, two more than required under FCC guidelines, as Xploration Station replaced Weekend Marketplace, which moved to KCOP, in September 2014.\nKTTV also airs reruns of I Love Lucy, which had premiered in 1951, months after the station lost its CBS affiliation. Reruns of the sitcom are still popular among Southern California viewers and have continued to air in the Los Angeles market perpetually since the series ended its run in 1957, thus making KTTV only the second station in the market (the other being KCBS-TV) to continue airing the sitcom since it ended. Weekday airings of I Love Lucy have since moved to KCOP (which airs the program in a one-hour block), but KTTV continues to air the landmark sitcom on weekends during the late afternoon hours.\nIn 1996, KTTV relocated its longtime studios on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, known as \"Metromedia Square\" (and later renamed the \"Fox Television Center\") to a new studio facility a few miles away on South Bundy Drive in West Los Angeles, near the Fox network headquarters (the network's headquarters are located on the 20th Century Fox studio lot). Several television series were filmed at the historic Metromedia Square television studio (which was once home to Norman Lear's Tandem Productions and TAT Communications Company) such as The Jeffersons, Mama's Family, Diff'rent Strokes, One Day at a Time, Soul Train, Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman, Fernwood 2 Night and the groundbreaking sketch comedy In Living Color. Many of those programs, either in first-run or off-network syndication, aired on KTTV. The Metromedia complex was demolished in 2003 to make way for the construction of Helen Bernstein High School (which is part of the Los Angeles Unified School District).\nOn May 16, 2006, KTTV launched a new website based on Fox Television Stations' MyFox interface; this format became standard on the websites of each of the Fox-owned stations \u2013 and was even adopted by some of Fox's affiliates not owned by the network \u2013 by the end of that year (the \"MyFox\" branded websites were operated by former News Corporation subsidiary EndPlay until 2012, when the sites were migrated to the WorldNow platform).\nKTTV launched the Light TV network on a subchannel starting December 22, 2016, with another Fox TV station, WNYW.\nOn December 14, 2017, The Walt Disney Company, owner of ABC and KABC-TV, announced its intent to buy KTTV's parent company, 21st Century Fox, for $52.4 billion; the sale excluded the Fox Television Stations unit (including KTTV and KCOP), the Fox network, Fox News, Fox Sports 1 and the MyNetworkTV programming service, which were transferred to a separate company.\n\nProgramming\nSports programming\nSince the team's move to Los Angeles in 1958 (with exception of a brief pause from 1993 to 1995), KTTV has carried Los Angeles Dodgers baseball games from varying sources; the station aired road games beginning in the late 1970s with the home games on the subscription\/pay-per-view service Dodgervision; these road games aired on the station until 1992, when KTLA began airing the road games beginning with the 1993 season. Currently, select Dodger games are broadcast nationally through the network's sports division via its MLB package since 1996. KTTV has also aired the Dodgers' 2017, 2018 and 2020 World Series appearances, including the team's championship victory in 2020, their first title in 32 years. All other Dodger games are currently broadcast locally through SportsNet LA (with a small number of games simulcast over-the-air on KTLA since 2016). KTTV also airs any Angels games that are aired through Fox's MLB contract, including the team's World Series victory in 2002.\nFrom 1972 to 1974, the station also carried games involving the Los Angeles Sharks of the WHA.\nWith the return of the Rams franchise to Los Angeles, since 2016, KTTV has been the 'unofficial home' for the Los Angeles Rams through the network's primary rights of the National Football Conference. It had held this role for one season in 1994 prior to their move to St. Louis (that same year, Channel 11 aired two home interconference contests featuring the Raiders during their last season in Los Angeles). During the NFL regular season, Rams games are rotated with KNBC (through NBC Sunday Night Football), KABC-TV (through Monday Night Football) and most especially KCBS-TV (through the NFL on CBS). Since 2017, it has also broadcast Los Angeles Chargers games featuring a visiting NFC team, or games that are cross-flexed from CBS, with some select games from either team carried by KCOP if both teams are playing at the same time. Beginning in the 2018 season, the station began airing Thursday Night Football which is simulcast on NFL Network and if either one of the two LA teams are playing it serves as the local area station for gameday telecasts.\n\nNews operation\nKTTV presently broadcasts 52 hours of local newscasts each week (with 10 hours each weekday and two hours each on Saturdays and Sundays); this gives KTTV the second-largest local news output of any television station in the Los Angeles market, behind CW owned-and-operated station KTLA's 94 hours, 20 minutes of weekly newscasts. The station also produces The Issue Is:, a political discussion program hosted by Elex Michaelson which airs Friday nights at 10:30 p.m. and is also syndicated to other Fox stations across California, including KICU-TV in San Jose and KSWB-TV in San Diego. As is standard with Fox stations that carry early evening weekend newscasts, KTTV's Saturday and Sunday 5 p.m. newscasts are subject to delay or preemption due to network sports coverage.\nKTTV operates a Bell 407, branded on-air as \"SkyFox\", to provide aerial coverage of breaking news stories. KTTV previously operated two helicopters; one of them (known as \"Sky Fox 2\") was destroyed after it crashed at Van Nuys Airport in 2000.\nThroughout its history, the station has always operated a news department, partly owing to its former ties to the Los Angeles Times. KTTV aired an 8 p.m. newscast from 1984 to 1987; it also briefly moved its 10 p.m. newscast to 11 p.m. in 1986, in order to compete with existing local newscasts in that same timeslot on KABC-TV, KNBC and KCBS-TV; the newscast's format initially was unchanged, but the 8 p.m. edition was later dropped while the 11 p.m. newscast reverted to its previous 10 p.m. slot shortly after News Corporation took over Metromedia in the fall of 1987. During this time period, the station also experimented with newscasts at midday and midnight.\nIn June 1993, the station launched a new morning news program called Good Day L.A., a program that was inspired by sister station WNYW's Good Day New York, which debuted in 1988. On July 14, 2008, KTTV launched a half-hour 10 a.m. newscast, following Good Day L.A., as the station's first midday newscast since the mid-1980s; KTTV is currently the only station in Los Angeles to have a local newscast in that timeslot. KTTV and KCOP began producing its local newscasts in high definition on October 15, 2008. On December 1, 2008, KTTV fully took over production of KCOP's 11 p.m. newscast, which was reduced from an hour to 30 minutes and retitled Fox News at 11, marking the end of a KCOP-produced and branded newscast. The newscast on channel 13 then became anchored by KTTV's 10 p.m. anchors Carlos Amezcua and Christine Devine, as it was considered an extension of the earlier newscast (in the case of KCOP, all of its newscasts on that station were eliminated on September 22, 2013).\nOn December 8, 2008, KTTV debuted a half-hour midday newscast at noon on weekdays. On April 27, 2009, KTTV introduced Good Day L.A. Today, a recap program airing at 12:30 p.m. weekdays that featured select segments featured on that day's edition of Good Day L.A.; that show has since been replaced by TMZ on TV. On April 12, 2010, the station expanded its weekday morning newscast by a half-hour to 4:30 a.m. Until September 12, 2011, KTTV was one of only two Fox owned-and-operated stations (the other being Chicago's WFLD) that did not have an early evening newscast on weeknights and\/or weekends; this changed when KTTV launched an hour-long 5 p.m. newscast on that date called Studio 11 L.A. On June 30, 2014, KTTV expanded its noon newscast from 30 minutes to 1 hour.\nOn April 28, 2016, KTTV changed the name of its 5 p.m. newscast to Fox 11 5:00 News using the same anchors from Studio 11 L.A. Weekend early evening newscasts became known as Fox 11 Weekend News.\nIn September 2018, KTTV canceled its half-hour 10 a.m. newscast.\nOn December 10, 2018, Fox 11 Morning News adopted the Good Day L.A. branding, expanding the newscast from 7 a.m. to 4:30 a.m.\nOn April 1, 2019, Good Day L.A. expands from 4:30 a.m. to 4 a.m.\nIn September 2022, Good Day L.A. expanded to 10 a.m., running until 11 a.m. KTTV also cancelled its mid-day newscast in the same month.\n\nAnonymous news report\nOn July 26, 2007, KTTV aired a report on the hacktivist group Anonymous, calling them a group of \"hackers on steroids\", \"domestic terrorists\", and collectively an \"Internet hate machine\". The report, which became the source for numerous internet memes, featured an unnamed former \"hacker\" who had fallen out with Anonymous and explained his view of the Anonymous culture. In addition, the report also mentioned \"raids\" on Habbo, a \"national campaign to spoil the new Harry Potter book ending\", and threats to \"bomb sports stadiums\".\n\nNotable current on-air staff\nChristine Devine \u2013 anchor  (1990\u2013present)\nLaura Diaz \u2013 reporter (2012\u2013present)\nGigi Graciette \u2013 reporter (2002\u2013present)\nAraksya Karapetyan \u2013 anchor (2012\u2013present)\nJennifer Lahmers \u2013 anchor (2023\u2013present)\nMaria Quiban \u2013 weather anchor (2000\u2013present)\nGina Silva \u2013 general assignment and investigative reporter (2001\u2013present)\nMarla Tellez \u2013 anchor and reporter (2014\u2013present); cousin of Rowdy Tellez, Milwaukee Brewers player\n\nNotable former on-air staff\nCarlos Amezcua \u2013 anchor (2007\u20132013, later with KUSI in San Diego)\nJohn Beard \u2013 anchor (later with WGRZ in Buffalo)\nRod Bernsen \u2013 helicopter reporter (retired)\nLisa Breckenridge \u2013 anchor (1999\u20132017)\nTony Cox \u2013 anchor\/reporter (later with NPR)\nSteve Edwards \u2013 anchor (1995\u20132017)\nHal Fishman (later with KTLA; deceased)\nCourtney Friel \u2013 reporter, now with KTLA\nDavid Garcia \u2013 anchor\/reporter (later with KPSP-CD in Palm Springs; deceased)\nLisa Joyner (later with KCBS-TV\/KCAL-TV)\nSteve Kmetko \u2013 reporter (2007\u20132008)\nCarol Lin \u2013 weekend anchor\/reporter\nDorothy Lucey \u2013 Good Day L.A. co-host\/entertainment anchor\nJean Martirez \u2013 former morning anchor\nLisa McRee \u2013 former fill-in anchor\nAntonio Mora \u2013 anchor\nMichaela Pereira \u2013 anchor\/reporter (2020\u20132022)\nGeorge Putnam \u2013 anchor (deceased)\nJillian (Barberie) Reynolds \u2013 Good Day L.A. co-host\/weather reporter (1995\u20132012)\nBill Ritter \u2013 Reporter (now at WABC)\nLauren Sanchez \u2013 former entertainment reporter, special projects reporter, and fill-in anchor\nMaria Sansone \u2013 Good Day LA co-host and anchor\nJohn Schwada \u2013 political reporter\nMark Thompson \u2013 chief meteorologist\/local program host (1992\u20132011) \u2013 now at KFI Los Angeles\nJane Wells \u2013 reporter (now with the Los Angeles bureau of CNBC)\nBill Welsh \u2013 reporter\n\nTechnical information\nSubchannels\nThe station's signal is multiplexed:\n\nAnalog-to-digital conversion\nKTTV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 11, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television.

It was released as the first promotional single from the band's fifth studio album, Death of a Bachelor, on November 26, 2015 (Thanksgiving Day) through Fueled by Ramen and DCD2. The song was written by Brendon Urie, White Sea and Jake Sinclair and was produced by Sinclair.\n\nBackground\nThe song's inspiration derives from Urie's passion for Los Angeles and is about someone who has fallen in love with L.A. and will stop at nothing to survive and succeed in the city. A video of the audio for \"LA Devotee\" was uploaded to Fueled by Ramen's official YouTube channel on the day of its release, November 26, 2015. It has been streamed over 55 million times on YouTube and over 262 million times on Spotify as of December 2022.\n\nMusic video\nThe song's official music video was released September 22, 2016, starring Noah Schnapp, a child actor known for his role as Will Byers in the Netflix series Stranger Things. The video starts with a young girl played by Anna Sachtleben nervously trying to cross a field with a dog barking in the background. The girl falls down and gets kidnapped by an unknown cloaked figure as the camera shows a shot of the mysterious \"Join Us\" logo cropped into the field. The next scene shows a young boy (Schnapp) being strapped to a chair singing the song while experiencing bizarre things, with Brendon also singing the song on a screen. The young girl also makes an appearance forcing the boy to drink a Eucharist. The last scene shows four cloaked figures strapping two mechanisms to the boy, causing him to be electrocuted and then suffer a seizure. Afterwards, the video ends with Brendon walking up to him with rubber gloves in a menacing manner. It is unknown what Brendon is to do next. \nBetween shots of Schnapp being tortured, several disturbing images can be seen, including men with animal heads, blood poured over a skull, children with black holes for their eyes, and a symbol of the Church of Satan (featuring Baphomet's head inside an inverted pentagon) projected over Urie's face.\n\nOther references\nThe song references multiple places in the Great Los Angeles area, including:\n\nMulholland Drive\nHollywood Shrine\n\nCharts\nCertifications\n\n\n== References ==","123":"La Brea Avenue is a prominent north-south thoroughfare in the City of Los Angeles and in Los Angeles County, California.\n\nLa Brea is known for having diverse ethnic communities, and many shops and restaurants along its route.\n\nHistory\nLa Brea is the Spanish phrase meaning \"the tar.\" The La Brea Tar Pits, which the 1828 Mexican land grant Rancho La Brea was named for, are to the west of its intersection with Wilshire Boulevard in the Mid-Wilshire area.\nIn its early history, its northern section followed Arroyo La Brea, a former creek fed by springs in the Santa Monica Mountains that flowed south into Ballona Creek.

It was named for Rancho Las Cienegas, literally \"The Ranch Of The Swamps,\" an area of marshland south of Rancho La Brea.\n\nRoute description\nFrom south of Fairview Boulevard and from north of Obama Boulevard (formerly Rodeo Road), La Cienega Boulevard is a regular surface street.  Offices for A&E Network, The History Channel and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences are located on La Cienega as were the studios of Citadel Broadcasting flagships KABC and KLOS, two of Los Angeles' biggest radio stations, which were demolished for an apartment and shopping complex, currently under construction. La Cienega Boulevard was formerly the location of the headquarters of the defunct book publisher Price Stern Sloan. A portion of La Cienega in and adjacent to Beverly Hills is known as \"Restaurant Row\" for its large number of upscale restaurants.  South of Olympic, La Cienega through between the Pico-Robertson and South Carthay neighborhoods in West Los Angeles and through the Crestview neighborhood in West Los Angeles into Culver City and is known for its large number of automotive-related business including several used car dealerships and many body shops and auto mechanics.\n\nIt continues south passing Interstate 10, and the Metro E Line. \nUnusually for Southern California, south of the Santa Monica (10) Freeway, La Cienega was built to freeway standards in the late 1940s as part of the proposed Laurel Canyon Freeway, part of State Route 170.  The SR 170 freeway was never completed south of U.S. Route 101, and the stretch of La Cienega from just north of Fairview Blvd in Inglewood, through Baldwin Hills and along the Kenneth Hahn State Recreation Area to Obama Boulevard in Los Angeles is a divided, limited access expressway with few traffic signals.  As such, emergency call boxes like those found along the area's freeways were installed along that stretch in the early 1970s.\nSouth of Fairview Boulevard, La Cienega runs parallel to the San Diego (405) Freeway and terminates at El Segundo Boulevard in Del Aire along the west side of the freeway. A non-contiguous segment also named La Cienega Boulevard runs along the east side of the 405 freeway, roughly between El Segundo Boulevard and Rosecrans Avenue in Del Aire.\n\nLa Cienega Design Quarter\nThe area of La Cienega Boulevard, from Beverly Boulevard to Santa Monica Boulevard, and its satellite streets is known as the La Cienega Design Quarter. Its shops and galleries house many antiques, furniture, rugs, accessories and art. Art dealer Felix Landau operated his trend-setting gallery there in the 1960s.\n\nRestaurant Row\nLa Cienega in Beverly Hills, north of Wilshire Boulevard, is known as Restaurant Row because it features many upscale restaurants. From Wilshire in Beverly Hills traveling north the best known establishments include Benihana, The Stinking Rose, Darioush, the original Lawry's the Prime Rib, Hakobe, Tokyo Table - Tokyo City Cuisine, Matsuhisa, Fogo de Ch\u00e3o, Gyu-Kaku, Woo Lae Oak, The Bazaar by Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, and Morton's.\n\nEtymology\nLa Cienega Boulevard is named after Rancho Las Cienegas Mexican land grant roughly in the region now called \"West Los Angeles.\" The Spanish phrase la ci\u00e9naga translates into English as \"the swamp\" and the area named \"Las Ci\u00e9negas\" was a continual marshland due to the course of the Los Angeles River through that area prior to a massive southerly shift in 1825 to roughly its present course. The difference in spelling in Los Angeles between the Castilian Spanish word ci\u00e9naga and the name of the thoroughfare, which is common in other Iberian languages like Extremaduran, originated with the name of the ranch.\n\nTransportation\nMetro Local lines 105 runs on La Cienega Boulevard.

The lake bed still exists as a municipal park (Lacy Park) in the City of San Marino just south of the Raymond Dike, but it holds no water.

Pacific Electric would go on to operate local Red Cars along the street, with service ending in January 1941.\n\nIn Altadena\nThe northernmost end of the road lies at the very foot of the San Gabriel Mountains in Altadena and immediately accesses Las Flores Canyon. The first resident of Las Flores Canyon was the Forsyth Ranch. It sold in 1919 to Mr. Cobb who had an enormous and fascinating estate on the alluvial fan which emanates from the Canyon. Las Flores was also known for its small and short-lived gold mining operations there. The Cobb Estate was deeded to the United States Forest Service as a free growth Arboretum in 1967. The gates on Lake Avenue mark the entrance to the estate which still has its long, paved, curving driveway which leads to the site of the defunct manor. The adjacent trailhead of the Sam Merrill Trail also leads into the canyon from Lake Avenue. This is the origin of the local term \"top of Lake,\" which refers to the northernmost neighborhoods.\nIn the days of the Red Car in Altadena (1902\u20131941), Lake Avenue was known as the short line, or Oak Knoll line. Oak Knoll is the street into which Lake Avenue transitions with a slow curve to the right and then back to the left. The Pacific Electric cars came up from a switch on the Huntington Drive line below the famous hotel of the same name. The \u201cshort line\u201d was a shorter way to get to Lake and Mariposa in Altadena without having to ride the circuitous route up Fair Oaks Avenue.\nIn 1914 a spur on the short line was built across Mendocino Street from Lake Avenue to Allen Street and the development of Country Club Parks. The line was put there to access the new development and the Altadena Country Club and Golf Course.\n\nIn Pasadena\nLake Avenue was originally named Lake Vineyard Avenue after the ranch of the same name (on which the lake mentioned above was located) on which the street was partially located. Lake Avenue is located centrally to Pasadena and is the East West divider of the city; Fair Oaks Avenue and Colorado Boulevard mark the postal center of town (0e\/w, 0n\/s) where its downtown section had originally developed. This postal division carries through into Altadena. However, Lake defines County Road Division No. 5 (West) from County Road Division No. 4 (East). Holliston Church is located at the intersection with Colorado. Lake Avenue defines the eastern boundary of the original Woodbury Ranch purchase of 937 acres (3.79 km2).\nIn Pasadena, Lake Avenue serves a great number of business districts and is relatively free of residential addresses, though some still exist from earlier times. Well known to locals is the South Lake Avenue Business District which runs south from Green Street to California Boulevard, about 1-mile (1.6 km) in length.  The shops on the east side of South Lake Avenue are notable for being accessible from the street and from Shoppers' lane, a half-mile long alleyway that runs alongside Lake Avenue. Also located on Lake Avenue is a large Macy's department store built in early 1940s modern architecture.\n\nSee also\nList of streets in the San Gabriel Valley\nColorado Boulevard\nMount Wilson Toll Road\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nReid, Hiram A.

In addition to Sun Valley, it runs through North Hollywood and Universal City. It runs for about 7.3 miles (11.7 km) before ending directly south of Ventura Boulevard. It crosses intersections with Interstate 5, State Route 134, and US Route 101. From a 5-way intersection at Victory Boulevard it runs diagonally to the southeast, creating 6-way intersections at the crossings of Burbank Boulevard and Tujunga Avenue, as well as Vineland Avenue and Camarillo Street.\nAt its busy southern end, Lankershim crosses the Los Angeles River as it briefly merges with Cahuenga Boulevard before passing the historic Campo de Cahuenga and the Universal City\/Studio City Metro Station, then crossing the Hollywood Freeway and Ventura Boulevard, all within the space of about 0.5 miles (0.80 km).\n\nTransportation\nMetro Local line 224 serves Lankershim Boulevard.\nIt passes two Metro Rail stations, North Hollywood and Universal City\/Studio City, both served by the B Line, and the former station is also served by the G Line.\n\nHistory\nNamed for one of the area's founding families, Lankershim Boulevard is one of the oldest streets in the area surrounding what is now the neighborhood of North Hollywood. It was a major thoroughfare for the town of Toluca (which was itself renamed \"Lankershim\" in 1896), connecting it to Los Angeles by way of the Cahuenga Pass. In the center of Toluca, it crossed the Southern Pacific Railroad, with a depot near the current location of the North Hollywood Metro Station at Chandler Boulevard. The foundations of the original Campo de Cahuenga adobe were unearthed beneath Lankershim Boulevard during construction of the Metro Red Line subway. These parts of the foundations within the park are preserved as an exhibit, and the \"footprint\" of the foundations under the street and sidewalk is marked by decorative pavement.\nLankershim Boulevard around Magnolia Boulevard was the heart of the town of Lankershim and of North Hollywood and until the mid-1950s boasted the largest concentration of retail stores, banks, restaurants, and entertainment in the Valley. In 1953, for example, the shopping strip included three full-line department stores: J.C. Penney at 5261 Lankershim, Yeakel & Goss department store at 5272, and the upscale single-location Rathbun's department store at 5307\u201315. There were also branches of the large Harris & Frank clothing chain at 5236 Lankershim, J. J. Newberry five and dime at 5321, and Safeway at 5356. However, the nearby Valley Plaza shopping center, designed for accessibility by car with plenty of free parking, opened in 1951 and kept growing until 1956 when it claimed to be the third-largest shopping center in the country. It was difficult for the Lankershim retail district to compete and by 1980, most stores had closed including Rathbun's. Donte's, one of the West Coast's best known jazz clubs in the 1970s and 1980s was at 4269. It opened in 1966 and closed in 1988 and is now the Century West BMW auto dealer site.\n\nCicLAvia\nIn 2015, Lankershim Boulevard, along with Ventura Boulevard, was the site of CicLAvia, an event sponsored by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority in which major roads are temporarily closed to motorized vehicle traffic and used for recreational human-powered transport.\n\n\n== References ==","127":"Laurel Canyon Boulevard is a major street in the city of Los Angeles. It starts off at Polk Street in Sylmar in the northern San Fernando Valley near the junction of the San Diego (Interstate 405) and the Golden State (I-5)) freeways. Laurel Canyon Boulevard bypasses the city of San Fernando to the west, running parallel to I-5 in the vicinity of Pacoima and Arleta. The portion through Sun Valley passes through rock quarries and a great deal of open space.\nFrom the intersection with Webb Avenue, Laurel Canyon Boulevard heads due south, cutting through North Hollywood, closely following the Hollywood Freeway (SR 170). Laurel Canyon Boulevard passes through the Valley Village neighborhood, one mile (1.6 km) west of the Hollywood Split (the intersection of the Hollywood (U.S. 101\/SR 170) and Ventura (U.S. 101\/SR 134) freeways). This would have been the start of the proposed Laurel Canyon Freeway, which would have provided a direct freeway connection from the southeastern San Fernando Valley to the Los Angeles International Airport. The proposed route was along the current routing of Laurel Canyon Boulevard, but the emergence of the Laurel Canyon neighborhood as a movie star enclave doomed the project, as did local opposition.\nLaurel Canyon itself found counterculture fame in the 1960s as home to many of L.A.'s top rock musicians, such as Frank Zappa. The bohemian spirit endures; every year, residents gather for a group photograph at the country market. Laurel Canyon Boulevard was also immortalized by The Doors in their 1968 song \"Love Street.\"\nLaurel Canyon Boulevard crosses the Laurel Canyon G Line station at its intersection with Chandler Boulevard in Valley Village.

Laurel Canyon Boulevard\u2019s southern terminus is at its intersection with Sunset Boulevard and Crescent Heights Boulevard.\nLaurel Canyon Boulevard and Coldwater Canyon Avenue to the west between the southern San Fernando Valley and West Hollywood are also popular alternate routes to the Hollywood Freeway (US 101) during rush hour.\n\nLaurel Canyon Freeway\nThe Laurel Canyon Freeway was to have been a north-south freeway in Central Los Angeles and its suburbs.  It derived its name from Laurel Canyon, the proposed route by which the freeway would traverse the Santa Monica Mountains.\nIts proposed alignment was from the intersection of the Hollywood Freeway (U.S. Route 101) and the Ventura Freeway (California State Route 134) in the southeastern San Fernando Valley \u2014 to the San Diego Freeway (I-405) near Los Angeles International Airport.\nHowever, the emerging popularity of Laurel Canyon as a movie star enclave in the 1960s ultimately doomed the project. The only portion of the freeway that was built was a small section of La Cienega Boulevard through the Baldwin Hills district of southwestern Los Angeles.\n\nHistory\nIn 1919 Harry Houdini rented the cottage at 2435 Laurel Canyon Boulevard, while making movies for Lasky Pictures.  His wife occupied it for a time after his death. As of 2011 that site was a vacant lot.  The main mansion building itself was rebuilt after it was destroyed in the 1959 Laurel Canyon fire, and is now a historic venue.

With roughly 3.9 million residents within the city limits as of 2020, It is the second-most populous city in the United States, behind only New York City; it is also the commercial, financial and cultural center of Southern California. Los Angeles has an ethnically and culturally diverse population, and is the principal city of a metropolitan area of 13.2 million people. Greater Los Angeles, which includes the Los Angeles and Riverside\u2013San Bernardino metropolitan areas, is a sprawling metropolis of over 20.6 million residents as of 2024.\nThe majority of the city proper lies in a basin in Southern California adjacent to the Pacific Ocean in the west and extending partly through the Santa Monica Mountains and north into the San Fernando Valley, with the city bordering the San Gabriel Valley to its east. It covers about 469 square miles (1,210 km2), and is the county seat of Los Angeles County, which is the most populous county in the United States with an estimated 9.86 million residents as of 2022. It is the fourth-most visited city in the U.S. with over 2.7 million visitors as of 2022.\nThe area that became Los Angeles was originally inhabited by the indigenous Tongva people and later claimed by Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo for Spain in 1542. The city was founded on September 4, 1781, under Spanish governor Felipe de Neve, on the village of Yaanga. It became a part of Mexico in 1821 following the Mexican War of Independence. In 1848, at the end of the Mexican\u2013American War, Los Angeles and the rest of California were purchased as part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and became part of the United States. Los Angeles was incorporated as a municipality on April 4, 1850, five months before California achieved statehood. The discovery of oil in the 1890s brought rapid growth to the city. The city was further expanded with the completion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913, which delivers water from Eastern California.\nLos Angeles has a diverse economy with a broad range of industries. Despite a steep exodus of film and television production since the COVID-19 pandemic, Los Angeles is still one of the largest hubs of American film production, the world's largest by revenue; the city is an important site in the history of film. It also has one of the busiest container ports in the Americas. In 2018, the Los Angeles metropolitan area had a gross metropolitan product of over $1.0 trillion, making it the city with the third-largest GDP in the world, after New York and Tokyo. Los Angeles hosted the Summer Olympics in 1932 and 1984, and will also host in 2028. Despite a business exodus from Downtown Los Angeles since the COVID-19 pandemic, the city's urban core is evolving as a cultural center with the world's largest showcase of architecture designed by Frank Gehry.\n\nToponymy\nOn September 4, 1781, a group of 44 settlers known as \"Los Pobladores\" founded the pueblo (town) they called El Pueblo de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora la Reina de los \u00c1ngeles, 'The Town of Our Lady the Queen of the Angels'. The original name of the settlement is disputed; the Guinness Book of World Records rendered it as \"El Pueblo de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora la Reina de los \u00c1ngeles de Porci\u00fancula\"; other sources have shortened or alternate versions of the longer name.\nThe local English pronunciation of the name of the city has varied over time. A 1953 article in the journal of the American Name Society asserts that the pronunciation  lawss AN-j\u0259l-\u0259s was established following the 1850 incorporation of the city and that since the 1880s the pronunciation  lohss ANG-g\u0259l-\u0259s emerged from a trend in California to give places Spanish, or Spanish-sounding, names and pronunciations. In 1908, librarian Charles Fletcher Lummis, who argued for the name's pronunciation with a hard g (), reported that there were at least 12 pronunciation variants. In the early 1900s, the Los Angeles Times advocated for pronouncing it Loce AHNG-hayl-ais (), approximating Spanish [los \u02c8a\u014bxeles], by printing the respelling under its masthead for several years. This did not find favor.\nSince the 1930s,  has been most common. In 1934, the United States Board on Geographic Names decreed that this pronunciation be used by the federal government. This was also endorsed in 1952 by a \"jury\" appointed by Mayor Fletcher Bowron to devise an official pronunciation.\nCommon pronunciations in the United Kingdom include  loss AN-jil-eez, -\u2060iz, -\u2060iss. Phonetician Jack Windsor Lewis described the most common one,  , as a spelling pronunciation based on analogy to Greek words ending in -\u200des, \"reflecting a time when the classics were familiar if Spanish was not\".\n\nHistory\nIndigenous history\nThe settlement of Indigenous Californians in the modern Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley was dominated by the Tongva (now also known as the Gabriele\u00f1o since the era of Spanish colonization). The historic center of Tongva power in the region was the settlement of Yaanga (Tongva: Iy\u00e1ang\u1e9a), meaning \"place of the poison oak\", which would one day be the site where the Spanish founded the Pueblo de Los \u00c1ngeles. Iy\u00e1ang\u1e9a has also been translated as \"the valley of smoke\".\n\nSpanish rule\nMaritime explorer Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo claimed the area of southern California for the Spanish Empire in 1542, while on an official military exploring expedition, as he was moving northward along the Pacific coast from earlier colonizing bases of New Spain in Central and South America. Gaspar de Portol\u00e0 and Franciscan missionary Juan Cresp\u00ed reached the present site of Los Angeles on August 2, 1769.\n\nIn 1771, Franciscan friar Jun\u00edpero Serra directed the building of the Mission San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel, the first mission in the area. On September 4, 1781, a group of 44 settlers known as \"Los Pobladores\" founded the pueblo (town) they called El Pueblo de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora la Reina de los \u00c1ngeles, 'The Town of Our Lady the Queen of the Angels'. The present-day city has the largest Roman Catholic archdiocese in the United States. Two-thirds of the Mexican or (New Spain) settlers were mestizo or mulatto, a mixture of African, indigenous and European ancestry. The settlement remained a small ranch town for decades, but by 1820, the population had increased to about 650 residents. Today, the pueblo is commemorated in the historic district of Los Angeles Pueblo Plaza and Olvera Street, the oldest part of Los Angeles.\n\nMexican rule\nNew Spain achieved its independence from the Spanish Empire in 1821, and the pueblo now existed within the new Mexican Republic. During Mexican rule, Governor P\u00edo Pico made Los Angeles the regional capital of Alta California. By this time, the new republic introduced more secularization acts within the Los Angeles region. In 1846, during the wider Mexican-American war, marines from the United States occupied the pueblo. This resulted in the siege of Los Angeles where 150 Mexican militias fought the occupiers which eventually surrendered.\nMexican rule ended during following the American Conquest of California, part of the larger Mexican-American War. Americans took control from the Californios after a series of battles, culminating with the signing of the Treaty of Cahuenga on January 13, 1847. The Mexican Cession was formalized in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, which ceded Los Angeles and the rest of Alta California to the United States.\n\nPost-Conquest era\nRailroads arrived with the completion of the transcontinental Southern Pacific line from New Orleans to Los Angeles in 1876 and the Santa Fe Railroad in 1885. Petroleum was discovered in the city and surrounding area in 1892, and by 1923, the discoveries had helped California become the country's largest oil producer, accounting for about one-quarter of the world's petroleum output.\nBy 1900, the population had grown to more than 102,000, putting pressure on the city's water supply. The completion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913, under the supervision of William Mulholland, ensured the continued growth of the city. Because of clauses in the city's charter that prevented the City of Los Angeles from selling or providing water from the aqueduct to any area outside its borders, many adjacent cities and communities felt compelled to join Los Angeles.\n\nLos Angeles created the first municipal zoning ordinance in the United States. On September 14, 1908, the Los Angeles City Council promulgated residential and industrial land use zones. The new ordinance established three residential zones of a single type, where industrial uses were prohibited. The proscriptions included barns, lumber yards, and any industrial land use employing machine-powered equipment. These laws were enforced against industrial properties after the fact. These prohibitions were in addition to existing activities that were already regulated as nuisances. These included explosives warehousing, gas works, oil drilling, slaughterhouses, and tanneries. Los Angeles City Council also designated seven industrial zones within the city. However, between 1908 and 1915, the Los Angeles City Council created various exceptions to the broad proscriptions that applied to these three residential zones, and as a consequence, some industrial uses emerged within them. There are two differences between the 1908 Residence District Ordinance and later zoning laws in the United States. First, the 1908 laws did not establish a comprehensive zoning map as the 1916 New York City Zoning Ordinance did. Second, the residential zones did not distinguish types of housing; they treated apartments, hotels, and detached-single-family housing equally.\nIn 1910, Hollywood merged into Los Angeles, with 10 movie companies already operating in the city at the time. By 1921, more than 80 percent of the world's film industry was concentrated in L.A. The money generated by the industry kept the city insulated from much of the economic loss suffered by the rest of the country during the Great Depression.\nBy 1930, the population surpassed one million. In 1932, the city hosted the Summer Olympics.\n\nPost-WWII\nDuring World War II Los Angeles was a major center of wartime manufacturing, such as shipbuilding and aircraft. Calship built hundreds of Liberty Ships and Victory Ships on Terminal Island, and the Los Angeles area was the headquarters of six of the country's major aircraft manufacturers (Douglas Aircraft Company, Hughes Aircraft, Lockheed, North American Aviation, Northrop Corporation, and Vultee). During the war, more aircraft were produced in one year than in all the pre-war years since the Wright brothers flew the first airplane in 1903, combined. Manufacturing in Los Angeles skyrocketed, and as William S. Knudsen, of the National Defense Advisory Commission put it, \"We won because we smothered the enemy in an avalanche of production, the like of which he had never seen, nor dreamed possible.\"\nAfter the end of World War II Los Angeles grew more rapidly than ever, sprawling into the San Fernando Valley. The expansion of the state owned Interstate Highway System during the 1950s and 1960s helped propel suburban growth and signaled the demise of the city's privately owned electrified rail system, once the world's largest.\n\nAs a consequence of World War II, suburban growth, and population density, many amusement parks were built and operated in this area. An example is Beverly Park, which was located at the corner of Beverly Boulevard and La Cienega before being closed and substituted by the Beverly Center.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, Los Angeles substantially reduced the amount of housing that could be built by drastically downzoning the city. In 1960, the city had a total zoned capacity for approximately 10 million people. By 1990, that capacity had fallen to 4.5 million as a result of policy decisions to ban housing through zoning.\nRacial tensions led to the Watts riots in 1965, resulting in 34 deaths and over 1,000 injuries.\n\nIn 1969, California became the birthplace of the Internet, as the first ARPANET transmission was sent from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to the Stanford Research Institute in Menlo Park.\nIn 1973, Tom Bradley was elected as the city's first African American mayor, serving for five terms until retiring in 1993. Other events in the city during the 1970s included the Symbionese Liberation Army's South Central standoff in 1974 and the Hillside Stranglers murder cases in 1977\u20131978.\nIn early 1984, the city surpassed Chicago in population, thus becoming the second largest city in the United States.\nIn 1984, the city hosted the Summer Olympic Games for the second time. Despite being boycotted by 14 Communist countries, the 1984 Olympics became more financially successful than any previous, and the second Olympics to turn a profit; the other, according to an analysis of contemporary newspaper reports, was the 1932 Summer Olympics, also held in Los Angeles.\n\nRacial tensions erupted on April 29, 1992, with the acquittal by a Simi Valley jury of four Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officers captured on videotape beating Rodney King, culminating in large-scale riots.\nIn 1994, the magnitude 6.7 Northridge earthquake shook the city, causing $12.5 billion in damage and 72 deaths. The century ended with the Rampart scandal, one of the most extensive documented cases of police misconduct in American history.\n\n21st century\nIn 2002, Mayor James Hahn led the campaign against secession, resulting in voters defeating efforts by the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood to secede from the city.\nIn 2022, Karen Bass became the city's first female mayor, making Los Angeles the largest U.S. city to have ever had a woman as mayor.\nLos Angeles will host the 2028 Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games, making Los Angeles the third city to host the Olympics three times.\n\nGeography\nTopography\nThe city of Los Angeles covers a total area of 502.7 square miles (1,302 km2), comprising 468.7 square miles (1,214 km2) of land and 34.0 square miles (88 km2) of water. The city extends for 44 miles (71 km) from north to south and for 29 miles (47 km) from east to west. The perimeter of the city is 342 miles (550 km).\nLos Angeles is both flat and hilly. The highest point in the city proper is Mount Lukens at 5,074 ft (1,547 m), located in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains at the north extent of the Crescenta Valley. The eastern end of the Santa Monica Mountains stretches from Downtown to the Pacific Ocean and separates the Los Angeles Basin from the San Fernando Valley. Other hilly parts of Los Angeles include the Mt. Washington area north of Downtown, eastern parts such as Boyle Heights, the Crenshaw district around the Baldwin Hills, and the San Pedro district.\nSurrounding the city are much higher mountains. Immediately to the north lie the San Gabriel Mountains, which is a popular recreation area for Angelenos. Its high point is Mount San Antonio, locally known as Mount Baldy, which reaches 10,064 feet (3,068 m). Further afield, the highest point in southern California is San Gorgonio Mountain, 81 miles (130 km) east of downtown Los Angeles, with a height of 11,503 feet (3,506 m).\nThe Los Angeles River, which is largely seasonal, is the primary drainage channel. It was straightened and lined in 51 miles (82 km) of concrete by the Army Corps of Engineers to act as a flood control channel. The river begins in the Canoga Park district of the city, flows east from the San Fernando Valley along the north edge of the Santa Monica Mountains, and turns south through the city center, flowing to its mouth in the Port of Long Beach at the Pacific Ocean. The smaller Ballona Creek flows into the Santa Monica Bay at Playa del Rey.\n\nVegetation\nLos Angeles is rich in native plant species partly because of its diversity of habitats, including beaches, wetlands, and mountains. The most prevalent plant communities are coastal sage scrub, chaparral shrubland, and riparian woodland. Native plants include: the California poppy, matilija poppy, toyon, Ceanothus, Chamise, Coast Live Oak, sycamore, willow and Giant Wildrye. Many of these native species, such as the Los Angeles sunflower, have become so rare as to be considered endangered. Mexican Fan Palms, Canary Island Palms, Queen Palms, Date Palms, and California Fan Palms are common in the Los Angeles area, although only the last is native to California, though still not native to the City of Los Angeles.\nLos Angeles has a number of official flora:\n\nthe official tree of Los Angeles is the Coral Tree (Erythrina afra)\nthe official flower is the Bird of Paradise (Strelitzia reginae)\nthe official plant is toyon (Heteromeles arbutifolia)\n\nFauna\nThe city has an urban population of bobcats (Lynx rufus). Mange is a common problem in this population. Although Serieys et al. 2014 find selection of immune genetics at several loci they do not demonstrate that this produces a real difference which helps the bobcats to survive future mange outbreaks.\n\nGeology\nLos Angeles is subject to earthquakes because of its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire. The geologic instability has produced numerous faults, which cause approximately 10,000 earthquakes annually in Southern California, though most of them are too small to be felt. The strike-slip San Andreas Fault system, which sits at the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, passes through the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The segment of the fault passing through Southern California experiences a major earthquake roughly every 110 to 140 years, and seismologists have warned about the next \"big one\", as the last major earthquake was the 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake. The Los Angeles basin and metropolitan area are also at risk from blind thrust earthquakes. Major earthquakes that have hit the Los Angeles area include the 1933 Long Beach, 1971 San Fernando, 1987 Whittier Narrows, and the 1994 Northridge events. All but a few are of low intensity and are not felt. The USGS has released the UCERF California earthquake forecast, which models earthquake occurrence in California. Parts of the city are also vulnerable to tsunamis; harbor areas were damaged by waves from Aleutian Islands earthquake in 1946, Valdivia earthquake in 1960, Alaska earthquake in 1964, Chile earthquake in 2010 and Japan earthquake in 2011.\n\nCityscape\nThe city is divided into many different districts and neighborhoods, some of which had been separately incorporated cities that eventually merged with Los Angeles. These neighborhoods were developed piecemeal, and are well-defined enough that the city has signage which marks nearly all of them.\n\nOverview\nThe city's street patterns generally follow a grid plan, with uniform block lengths and occasional roads that cut across blocks. However, this is complicated by rugged terrain, which has necessitated having different grids for each of the valleys that Los Angeles covers. Major streets are designed to move large volumes of traffic through many parts of the city, many of which are extremely long; Sepulveda Boulevard is 43 miles (69 km) long, while Foothill Boulevard is over 60 miles (97 km) long, reaching as far east as San Bernardino. Drivers in Los Angeles suffer from one of the worst rush hour periods in the world, according to an annual traffic index by navigation system maker, TomTom. LA drivers spend an additional 92 hours in traffic each year. During the peak rush hour, there is 80% congestion, according to the index.\nLos Angeles is often characterized by the presence of low-rise buildings, in contrast to New York City. Outside of a few centers such as Downtown, Warner Center, Century City, Koreatown, Miracle Mile, Hollywood, and Westwood, skyscrapers and high-rise buildings are not common in Los Angeles. The few skyscrapers built outside of those areas often stand out above the rest of the surrounding landscape. Most construction is done in separate units, rather than wall-to-wall. However, Downtown Los Angeles itself has many buildings over 30 stories, with fourteen over 50 stories, and two over 70 stories, the tallest of which is the Wilshire Grand Center.\n\n\tSelection of neighborhoods in Los Angeles\n\nClimate\nLos Angeles has a two-season semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BSh) with dry summers and very mild winters, but it receives more annual precipitation than most semi-arid climates, narrowly missing the boundary of a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csb on the coast, Csa otherwise). Daytime temperatures are generally temperate all year round. In winter, they average around 68 \u00b0F (20 \u00b0C). Autumn months tend to be hot, with major heat waves a common occurrence in September and October, while the spring months tend to be cooler and experience more precipitation. Los Angeles has plenty of sunshine throughout the year, with an average of only 35 days with measurable precipitation annually.\nTemperatures in the coastal basin exceed 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) on a dozen or so days in the year, from one day a month in April, May, June and November to three days a month in July, August, October and to five days in September. Temperatures in the San Fernando and San Gabriel Valleys are considerably warmer. Temperatures are subject to substantial daily swings; in inland areas the difference between the average daily low and the average daily high is over 30 \u00b0F (17 \u00b0C). The average annual temperature of the sea is 63 \u00b0F (17 \u00b0C), from 58 \u00b0F (14 \u00b0C) in January to 68 \u00b0F (20 \u00b0C) in August. Hours of sunshine total more than 3,000 per year, from an average of 7 hours of sunshine per day in December to an average of 12 in July.\nDue to the mountainous terrain of the surrounding region, the Los Angeles area contains a large number of distinct microclimates, causing extreme variations in temperature in close physical proximity to each other. For example, the average July maximum temperature at the Santa Monica Pier is 70 \u00b0F (21 \u00b0C) whereas it is 95 \u00b0F (35 \u00b0C) in Canoga Park, 15 miles (24 km) away. The city, like much of the Southern Californian coast, is subject to a late spring\/early summer weather phenomenon called \"June Gloom\". This involves overcast or foggy skies in the morning that yield to sun by early afternoon.\n\nMore recently, statewide droughts in California have further strained the city's water security. Downtown Los Angeles averages 14.67 in (373 mm) of precipitation annually, mainly occurring between November and March, generally in the form of moderate rain showers, but sometimes as heavy rainfall during winter storms. Rainfall is usually higher in the hills and coastal slopes of the mountains because of orographic uplift. Summer days are usually rainless. Rarely, an incursion of moist air from the south or east can bring brief thunderstorms in late summer, especially to the mountains. The coast gets slightly less rainfall, while the inland and mountain areas get considerably more. Years of average rainfall are rare. The usual pattern is a year-to-year variability, with a short string of dry years of 5\u201310 in (130\u2013250 mm) rainfall, followed by one or two wet years with more than 20 in (510 mm). Wet years are usually associated with warm water El Ni\u00f1o conditions in the Pacific, dry years with cooler water La Ni\u00f1a episodes. A series of rainy days can bring floods to the lowlands and mudslides to the hills, especially after wildfires have denuded the slopes.\n\nBoth freezing temperatures and snowfall are extremely rare in the city basin and along the coast, with the last occurrence of a 32 \u00b0F (0 \u00b0C) reading at the downtown station being January 29, 1979; freezing temperatures occur nearly every year in valley locations while the mountains within city limits typically receive snowfall every winter. The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was 2.0 inches (5 cm) on January 15, 1932. While the most recent snowfall occurred in February 2019, the first snowfall since 1962, with snow falling in areas adjacent to Los Angeles as recently as January 2021. Brief, localized instances of hail can occur on rare occasions, but are more common than snowfall. At the official downtown station, the highest recorded temperature is 113 \u00b0F (45 \u00b0C) on September 27, 2010, while the lowest is 28 \u00b0F (\u22122 \u00b0C), on January 4, 1949. Within the City of Los Angeles, the highest temperature ever officially recorded is 121 \u00b0F (49 \u00b0C), on September 6, 2020, at the weather station at Pierce College in the San Fernando Valley neighborhood of Woodland Hills. During autumn and winter, Santa Ana winds sometimes bring much warmer and drier conditions to Los Angeles, and raise wildfire risk.\n\nEnvironmental issues\nOwing to geography, heavy reliance on automobiles, and the Los Angeles\/Long Beach port complex, Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog. The Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley are susceptible to atmospheric inversion, which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles, airplanes, locomotives, shipping, manufacturing, and other sources.\n\nThe smog season lasts from approximately May to October. While other large cities rely on rain to clear smog, Los Angeles gets only 15 inches (380 mm) of rain each year: pollution accumulates over many consecutive days. Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation, including the Clean Air Act. When the act was passed, California was unable to create a State Implementation Plan that would enable it to meet the new air quality standards, largely because of the level of pollution in Los Angeles generated by older vehicles. More recently, the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating low-emission vehicles. Smog is expected to continue to drop in the coming years because of aggressive steps to reduce it, which include electric and hybrid cars, improvements in mass transit, and other measures.\nThe number of Stage 1 smog alerts in Los Angeles has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium. Despite improvement, the 2006 and 2007 annual reports of the American Lung Association ranked the city as the most polluted in the country with short-term particle pollution and year-round particle pollution. In 2008, the city was ranked the second most polluted and again had the highest year-round particulate pollution. The city met its goal of providing 20 percent of the city's power from renewable sources in 2010. The American Lung Association's 2013 survey ranks the metro area as having the nation's worst smog, and fourth in both short-term and year-round pollution amounts.\nLos Angeles is also home to the nation's largest urban oil field. There are more than 700 active oil wells within 1,500 feet (460 m) of homes, churches, schools and hospitals in the city, a situation about which the EPA has voiced serious concerns.\n\nDemographics\nThe 2010 U.S. census reported Los Angeles had a population of 3,792,621. The population density was 8,092.3 people per square mile (3,124.5 people\/km2). The age distribution was 874,525 people (23.1%) under 18, 434,478 people (11.5%) from 18 to 24, 1,209,367 people (31.9%) from 25 to 44, 877,555 people (23.1%) from 45 to 64, and 396,696 people (10.5%) who were 65 or older. The median age was 34.1 years. For every 100 females, there were 99.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 97.6 males.\nThere were 1,413,995 housing units\u2014up from 1,298,350 during 2005\u20132009\u2014at an average density of 2,812.8 households per square mile (1,086.0 households\/km2), of which 503,863 (38.2%) were owner-occupied, and 814,305 (61.8%) were occupied by renters. The homeowner vacancy rate was 2.1%; the rental vacancy rate was 6.1%. 1,535,444 people (40.5% of the population) lived in owner-occupied housing units and 2,172,576 people (57.3%) lived in rental housing units.\nAccording to the 2010 United States Census, Los Angeles had a median household income of $49,497, with 22.0% of the population living below the federal poverty line.\n\nRace and ethnicity\nAccording to the 2010 census, the racial makeup of Los Angeles included: 1,888,158 Whites (49.8%), 365,118 African Americans (9.6%), 28,215 Native Americans (0.7%), 426,959 Asians (11.3%), 5,577 Pacific Islanders (0.1%), 902,959 from other races (23.8%), and 175,635 (4.6%) from two or more races. There were 1,838,822 Hispanic or Latino residents of any race (48.5%). Los Angeles is home to people from more than 140 countries speaking 224 different identified languages. Ethnic enclaves like Chinatown, Historic Filipinotown, Koreatown, Little Armenia, Little Ethiopia, Tehrangeles, Little Tokyo, Little Bangladesh, and Thai Town provide examples of the polyglot character of Los Angeles.\n\nNon-Hispanic Whites were 28.7% of the population in 2010, compared to 86.3% in 1940. The majority of the Non-Hispanic White population is living in areas along the Pacific coast as well as in neighborhoods near and on the Santa Monica Mountains from the Pacific Palisades to Los Feliz.\nMexican ancestry makes up the largest ethnic group of Hispanics at 31.9% of the city's population, followed by those of Salvadoran (6.0%) and Guatemalan (3.6%) heritage. The Hispanic population has a long established Mexican-American and Central American community and is spread throughout the entire city of Los Angeles and its metropolitan area. It is most heavily concentrated in regions around Downtown, such as East Los Angeles, Northeast Los Angeles and Westlake. Furthermore, a vast majority of residents in neighborhoods in eastern South Los Angeles towards Downey are of Hispanic origin.\n\nThe largest Asian ethnic groups are Filipinos (3.2%) and Koreans (2.9%), which have their own established ethnic enclaves\u2014Koreatown in the Wilshire Center and Historic Filipinotown. Chinese people, which make up 1.8% of Los Angeles's population, reside mostly outside of Los Angeles city limits, in the San Gabriel Valley of eastern Los Angeles County, but make a sizable presence in the city, notably in Chinatown. Chinatown and Thaitown are also home to many Thais and Cambodians, which make up 0.3% and 0.1% of Los Angeles's population, respectively. The Japanese comprise 0.9% of the city's population and have an established Little Tokyo in the city's downtown, and another significant community of Japanese Americans is in the Sawtelle district of West Los Angeles. Vietnamese make up 0.5% of Los Angeles's population. Indians make up 0.9% of the city's population. Los Angeles is also home to Armenians, Assyrians, and Iranians, many of whom live in enclaves like Little Armenia and Tehrangeles.\nAfrican Americans have been the predominant ethnic group in South Los Angeles, which has emerged as the largest African-American community in the western United States since the 1960s. The neighborhoods of South Los Angeles with highest concentration of African Americans include Crenshaw, Baldwin Hills, Leimert Park, Hyde Park, Gramercy Park, Manchester Square and Watts. There is also a sizable Eritrean and Ethiopian community in the Fairfax region.\nLos Angeles has the second-largest Mexican, Armenian, Salvadoran, Filipino, and Guatemalan populations by city in the world, the third-largest Canadian population in the world, and has the largest Japanese, Iranian\/Persian, Cambodian, and Romani (Gypsy) populations in the country. The Italian community is concentrated in San Pedro.\nMost of Los Angeles' foreign-born population were born in Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, the Philippines and South Korea.\n\nReligion\nAccording to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, Christianity is the most prevalently practiced religion in Los Angeles (65%). The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles is the largest archdiocese in the country. Cardinal Roger Mahony, as the archbishop, oversaw construction of the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, which opened in September 2002 in Downtown Los Angeles.\nIn 2011, the once common, but ultimately lapsed, custom of conducting a procession and Mass in honor of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de los \u00c1ngeles, in commemoration of the founding of the City of Los Angeles in 1781, was revived by the Queen of Angels Foundation and its founder Mark Albert, with the support of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles as well as several civic leaders. The recently revived custom is a continuation of the original processions and Masses that commenced on the first anniversary of the founding of Los Angeles in 1782 and continued for nearly a century thereafter.\n\nWith 621,000 Jews in the metropolitan area, the region has the second-largest population of Jews in the United States, after New York City. Many of Los Angeles's Jews now live on the Westside and in the San Fernando Valley, though Boyle Heights once had a large Jewish population prior to World War II due to restrictive housing covenants. Major Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods include Hancock Park, Pico-Robertson, and Valley Village, while Jewish Israelis are well represented in the Encino and Tarzana neighborhoods, and Persian Jews in Beverly Hills. Many varieties of Judaism are represented in the greater Los Angeles area, including Reform, Conservative, Orthodox, and Reconstructionist. The Breed Street Shul in East Los Angeles, built in 1923, was the largest synagogue west of Chicago in its early decades; it is no longer in daily use as a synagogue and is being converted to a museum and community center. The Kabbalah Centre also has a presence in the city.\nThe International Church of the Foursquare Gospel was founded in Los Angeles by Aimee Semple McPherson in 1923 and remains headquartered there to this day. For many years, the church convened at Angelus Temple, which, at its construction, was one of the largest churches in the country.\n\nLos Angeles has had a rich and influential Protestant tradition. The first Protestant service in Los Angeles was a Methodist meeting held in a private home in 1850 and the oldest Protestant church still operating, First Congregational Church, was founded in 1867. In the early 1900s the Bible Institute Of Los Angeles published the founding documents of the Christian Fundamentalist movement and the Azusa Street Revival launched Pentecostalism. The Metropolitan Community Church also had its origins in the Los Angeles area. Important churches in the city include First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood, Bel Air Presbyterian Church, First African Methodist Episcopal Church of Los Angeles, West Angeles Church of God in Christ, Second Baptist Church, Crenshaw Christian Center, McCarty Memorial Christian Church, and First Congregational Church.\n\nThe Los Angeles California Temple, the second-largest temple operated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is on Santa Monica Boulevard in the Westwood neighborhood of Los Angeles. Dedicated in 1956, it was the first temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints built in California and it was the largest in the world when completed.\nThe Hollywood region of Los Angeles also has several significant headquarters, churches, and the Celebrity Center of Scientology.\nBecause of Los Angeles's large multi-ethnic population, a wide variety of faiths are practiced, including Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Zoroastrianism, Sikhism, Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed, various Eastern Orthodox Churches, Sufism, Shintoism, Taoism, Confucianism, Chinese folk religion and countless others. Immigrants from Asia for example, have formed a number of significant Buddhist congregations making the city home to the greatest variety of Buddhists in the world. The first Buddhist joss house was founded in the city in 1875. Atheism and other secular beliefs are also common, as the city is the largest in the Western U.S. Unchurched Belt.\n\nHomelessness\nAs of January 2020, there are 41,290 homeless people in the City of Los Angeles, comprising roughly 62% of the homeless population of LA County. This is an increase of 14.2% over the previous year (with a 12.7% increase in the overall homeless population of LA County). The epicenter of homelessness in Los Angeles is the Skid Row neighborhood, which contains 8,000 homeless people, one of the largest stable populations of homeless people in the United States. The increased homeless population in Los Angeles has been attributed to lack of housing affordability and to substance abuse. Almost 60 percent of the 82,955 people who became newly homeless in 2019 said their homelessness was because of economic hardship. In Los Angeles, black people are roughly four times more likely to experience homelessness.\n\nEconomy\nThe economy of Los Angeles is driven by international trade, entertainment (television, motion pictures, video games, music recording, and production), aerospace, technology, petroleum, fashion, apparel, and tourism. Other significant industries include finance, telecommunications, law, healthcare, and transportation. In the 2017 Global Financial Centres Index, Los Angeles was ranked the 19th most competitive financial center in the world and sixth most competitive in the U.S. after New York City, San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, and Washington, D.C. Although a business exodus has occurred away from Downtown Los Angeles since the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts are underway to re-invent the city's urban core as a cultural center with the world's largest showcase of architecture designed by Frank Gehry.\nOf the five major film studios, only Paramount Pictures is within Los Angeles' city limits; it is located in the so-called Thirty-Mile Zone of entertainment headquarters in Southern California.\nLos Angeles is the largest manufacturing center in the United States. The contiguous ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach together comprise the busiest port in the United States by some measures and the fifth busiest port in the world, vital to trade within the Pacific Rim.\n\nThe Los Angeles metropolitan area has a gross metropolitan product of over $1.0 trillion (as of 2018), making it the third-largest economic metropolitan area in the world, after New York and Tokyo. Los Angeles has been classified an \"alpha world city\" according to a 2012 study by a group at Loughborough University.\nThe Department of Cannabis Regulation enforces cannabis legislation after the legalization of the sale and distribution of cannabis in 2016. As of October 2019, more than 300 existing cannabis businesses (both retailers and their suppliers) have been granted approval to operate in what is considered the nation's largest market.\nAs of 2018, Los Angeles is home to three Fortune 500 companies: AECOM, CBRE Group, and Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co.

Talent is locally cultivated at premier institutions such as the Colburn School and the USC Thornton School of Music.\n\nThe city's Hollywood neighborhood has been recognized as the center of the motion picture industry, having held this distinction since the early 20th century, and the Los Angeles area is also associated with being the center of the television industry. The city is home to major film studios as well as major record labels. Los Angeles plays host to the annual Academy Awards, the Primetime Emmy Awards, the Grammy Awards as well as many other entertainment industry awards shows. Los Angeles is the site of the USC School of Cinematic Arts which is the oldest film school in the United States.\n\nMuseums and galleries\nThere are 841 museums and art galleries in Los Angeles County, more museums per capita than any other city in the U.S. Some of the notable museums are the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (the largest art museum in the Western United States), the Getty Center (part of the J. Paul Getty Trust, the world's wealthiest art institution), the Petersen Automotive Museum, the Huntington Library, the Natural History Museum, the Battleship Iowa, The Broad, which houses over 2,000 works of contemporary art and the Museum of Contemporary Art.

Enclaves of unincorporated areas are served by branches of the County of Los Angeles Public Library, many of which are within walking distance to residents.\n\nCuisine\nLos Angeles' food culture is a fusion of global cuisine brought on by the city's rich immigrant history and population. As of 2022, the Michelin Guide recognized 10 restaurants granting 2 restaurants two stars and eight restaurants one star.\nLatin American immigrants, particularly Mexican immigrants, brought tacos, burritos, quesadillas, tortas, tamales, and enchiladas served from food trucks and stands, taquerias, and caf\u00e9s. Asian restaurants, many immigrant-owned, exist throughout the city with hotspots in Chinatown, Koreatown, and Little Tokyo. Los Angeles also carries an outsized offering of vegan, vegetarian, and plant-based options.\n\nSports\nLos Angeles and its metropolitan area are the home of eleven top-level professional sports teams, several of which play in neighboring communities but use Los Angeles in their name.

At one time, the Los Angeles area hosted two NFL teams: the Rams and the Raiders. Both left the city in 1995, with the Rams moving to St. Louis, and the Raiders moving back to their original home of Oakland. After 21 seasons in St. Louis, on January 12, 2016, the NFL announced the Rams would be moving back to Los Angeles for the 2016 NFL season with its home games played at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for four seasons. Prior to 1995, the Rams played their home games in the Coliseum from 1946 to 1979 which made them the first professional sports team to play in Los Angeles, and then moved to Anaheim Stadium from 1980 until 1994. The San Diego Chargers announced on January 12, 2017, that they would also relocate back to Los Angeles (the first since its inaugural season in 1960) and become the Los Angeles Chargers beginning in the 2017 NFL season and played at Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, California for three seasons. The Rams and the Chargers would soon move to the newly built SoFi Stadium, located in nearby Inglewood during the 2020 season.\n\nLos Angeles boasts a number of sports venues, including Dodger Stadium, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, BMO Stadium and the Crypto.com Arena. The Forum, SoFi Stadium, Dignity Health Sports Park, the Rose Bowl, Angel Stadium, Honda Center, and Intuit Dome are also in adjacent cities and cities in Los Angeles's metropolitan area.\nLos Angeles has twice hosted the Summer Olympic Games: in 1932 and in 1984, and will host the games for a third time in 2028. Los Angeles will be the third city after London (1908, 1948 and 2012) and Paris (1900, 1924 and 2024) to host the Olympic Games three times. When the tenth Olympic Games were hosted in 1932, the former 10th Street was renamed Olympic Blvd. Los Angeles also hosted the Deaflympics in 1985 and Special Olympics World Summer Games in 2015.\n\nEight NFL Super Bowls were also held in the city and its surrounding areas - two at the Memorial Coliseum (the first Super Bowl, I and VII), five at the Rose Bowl in suburban Pasadena (XI, XIV, XVII, XXI, and XXVII), and one at the suburban Inglewood (LVI). The Rose Bowl also hosts an annual and highly prestigious NCAA college football game called the Rose Bowl, which happens every New Year's Day.\nLos Angeles also hosted eight FIFA World Cup soccer games at the Rose Bowl in 1994, including the final, where Brazil won. The Rose Bowl also hosted four matches in the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup, including the final, where the United States won against China on penalty kicks. This was the game where Brandi Chastain took her shirt off after she scored the tournament-winning penalty kick, creating an iconic image. Los Angeles will be one of eleven U.S. host cities for the 2026 FIFA World Cup with matches set to be held at SoFi Stadium.\nLos Angeles is one of six North American cities to have won championships in all five of its major leagues (MLB, NFL, NHL, NBA and MLS), having completed the feat with the Kings' 2012 Stanley Cup title.\n\nGovernment\nLos Angeles is a charter city as opposed to a general law city. The current charter was adopted on June 8, 1999, and has been amended many times. The elected government consists of the Los Angeles City Council and the mayor of Los Angeles, which operate under a mayor\u2013council government, as well as the city attorney (not to be confused with the district attorney, a county office) and controller. The mayor is Karen Bass. There are 15 city council districts.\nThe city has many departments and appointed officers, including the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), the Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners, the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD), the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (HACLA), the Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT), and the Los Angeles Public Library (LAPL).\nThe charter of the City of Los Angeles ratified by voters in 1999 created a system of advisory neighborhood councils that would represent the diversity of stakeholders, defined as those who live, work or own property in the neighborhood. The neighborhood councils are relatively autonomous and spontaneous in that they identify their own boundaries, establish their own bylaws, and elect their own officers. There are about 90 neighborhood councils.\nResidents of Los Angeles elect supervisors for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th supervisorial districts.\n\nFederal and state representation\nIn the California State Assembly, Los Angeles is split between fourteen districts. In the California State Senate, the city is split between eight districts. In the United States House of Representatives, it is split among nine congressional districts.\n\nCrime\nIn 1992, the city of Los Angeles recorded 1,092 murders. Los Angeles experienced a significant decline in crime in the 1990s and late 2000s and reached a 50-year low in 2009 with 314 homicides. This is a rate of 7.85 per 100,000 population\u2014a major decrease from 1980 when a homicide rate of 34.2 per 100,000 was reported. This included 15 officer-involved shootings. One shooting led to the death of a SWAT team member, Randal Simmons, the first in LAPD's history. Los Angeles in the year of 2013 totaled 251 murders, a decrease of 16 percent from the previous year. Police speculate the drop resulted from a number of factors, including young people spending more time online. In 2021, murders rose to the highest level since 2008 and there were 348.\nIn 2015, it was revealed that the LAPD had been under-reporting crime for eight years, making the crime rate in the city appear much lower than it really was.\nThe Dragna crime family and Mickey Cohen dominated organized crime in the city during the Prohibition era and reached its peak during the 1940s and 1950s with the \"Battle of Sunset Strip\" as part of the American Mafia, but has gradually declined since then with the rise of various black and Hispanic gangs in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\nAccording to the Los Angeles Police Department, the city is home to 45,000 gang members, organized into 450 gangs. Among them are the Crips and Bloods, which are both African American street gangs that originated in the South Los Angeles region. Latino street gangs such as the Sure\u00f1os, a Mexican American street gang, and Mara Salvatrucha, which has mainly members of Salvadoran descent, as well as other Central American descents, all originated in Los Angeles. This has led to the city being referred to as the \"Gang Capital of America\".\n\nEducation\nColleges and universities\nThere are three public universities within the city limits: California State University, Los Angeles (CSULA), California State University, Northridge (CSUN) and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).\nPrivate colleges in the city include:\n\nThe community college system consists of nine campuses governed by the trustees of the Los Angeles Community College District:\n\nThere are numerous additional colleges and universities outside the city limits in the Greater Los Angeles area, including the Claremont Colleges consortium, which includes the most selective liberal arts colleges in the U.S., and the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), one of the top STEM-focused research institutions in the world.\n\nSchools\nLos Angeles Unified School District serves almost all of the city of Los Angeles, as well as several surrounding communities, with a student population around 800,000. After Proposition 13 was approved in 1978, urban school districts had considerable trouble with funding. LAUSD has become known for its underfunded, overcrowded and poorly maintained campuses, although its 162 Magnet schools help compete with local private schools.\nSeveral small sections of Los Angeles are in the Inglewood Unified School District, and the Las Virgenes Unified School District. The Los Angeles County Office of Education operates the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts.\n\nMedia\nThe Los Angeles metro area is the second-largest broadcast designated market area in the U.S. (after New York) with 5,431,140 homes (4.956% of the U.S.), which is served by a wide variety of local AM and FM radio and television stations. Los Angeles and New York City are the only two media markets to have seven VHF allocations assigned to them.\nThe major daily English-language newspaper in the area is the Los Angeles Times. La Opini\u00f3n is the city's major daily Spanish-language paper. The Korea Times is the city's major daily Korean-language paper while The World Journal is the city and county's major Chinese newspaper. The Los Angeles Sentinel is the city's major African-American weekly paper, boasting the largest African-American readership in the Western United States. Investor's Business Daily is distributed from its LA corporate offices, which are headquartered in Playa del Rey.\n\nAs part of the region's aforementioned creative industry, the Big Five major broadcast television networks, ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC, and The CW, all have production facilities and offices throughout various areas of Los Angeles. All four major broadcast television networks, plus major Spanish-language networks Telemundo and Univision, also own and operate stations that both serve the Los Angeles market and serve as each network's West Coast flagship station: ABC's KABC-TV (Channel 7), CBS's KCBS-TV (Channel 2), Fox's KTTV-TV (Channel 11), NBC's KNBC-TV (Channel 4), The CW's KTLA-TV (Channel 5), MyNetworkTV's KCOP-TV (Channel 13), Telemundo's KVEA-TV (Channel 52), and Univision's KMEX-TV (Channel 34). The region also has four PBS member stations, with KCET, re-joining the network as secondary affiliate in August 2019, after spending the previous eight years as the nation's largest independent public television station. KTBN (Channel 40) is the flagship station of the religious Trinity Broadcasting Network, based out of Santa Ana. A variety of independent television stations, such as KCAL-TV (Channel 9), also operate in the area.\n\nThere are also a number of smaller regional newspapers, alternative weeklies and magazines, including the Los Angeles Register, Los Angeles Community News, (which focuses on coverage of the greater Los Angeles area), Los Angeles Daily News (which focuses coverage on the San Fernando Valley), LA Weekly, L.A. Record (which focuses coverage on the music scene in the Greater Los Angeles Area), Los Angeles Magazine, the Los Angeles Business Journal, the Los Angeles Daily Journal (legal industry paper), The Hollywood Reporter, Variety (both entertainment industry papers), and Los Angeles Downtown News. In addition to the major papers, numerous local periodicals serve immigrant communities in their native languages, including Armenian, English, Korean, Persian, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Hebrew, and Arabic. Many cities adjacent to Los Angeles also have their own daily newspapers whose coverage and availability overlaps with certain Los Angeles neighborhoods. Examples include The Daily Breeze (serving the South Bay), and The Long Beach Press-Telegram.\nLos Angeles arts, culture and nightlife news is also covered by a number of local and national online guides, including Time Out Los Angeles, Thrillist, Kristin's List, DailyCandy, Diversity News Magazine, LAist, and Flavorpill.\n\nInfrastructure\nTransportation\nFreeways\nThe city and the rest of the Los Angeles metropolitan area are served by an extensive network of freeways and highways. Texas Transportation Institute's annual Urban Mobility Report ranked Los Angeles area roads the most congested in the United States in 2019 as measured by annual delay per traveler, area residents experiencing a cumulative average of 119 hours waiting in traffic that year. Los Angeles was followed by San Francisco\/Oakland, Washington, D.C., and Miami. Despite the congestion in the city, the mean daily travel time for commuters in Los Angeles is shorter than other major cities, including New York City, Philadelphia and Chicago. Los Angeles's mean travel time for work commutes in 2006 was 29.2 minutes, similar to those of San Francisco and Washington, D.C.\nThe major highways that connect LA to the rest of the nation include Interstate 5, which runs south through San Diego to Tijuana in Mexico and north through Sacramento, Portland, and Seattle to the Canada\u2013US border; Interstate 10, the southernmost east\u2013west, coast-to-coast Interstate Highway in the United States, going to Jacksonville, Florida; and U.S. Route 101, which heads to the California Central Coast, San Francisco, the Redwood Empire, and the Oregon and Washington coasts.\n\nBuses\nThe Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA; branded as Metro) and other regional agencies provide a comprehensive bus system that covers Los Angeles County. While the Los Angeles Department of Transportation is responsible for contracting local and commuter bus services primarily within the city limits of Los Angeles and several immediate neighboring municipalities in southwest Los Angeles County, the largest bus system in the city is operated by Metro. Called Los Angeles Metro Bus, the system consists of 117 routes (excluding Metro Busway) throughout Los Angeles and neighboring cities primarily in southwestern Los Angeles County, with most routes following along a particular street in the city's street grid and run to or through Downtown Los Angeles. As of the third quarter of 2023, the system had an average ridership of approximately 692,500 per weekday, with a total of 197,950,700 riders in 2022. Metro also runs two Metro Busway lines, the G and J lines, which are bus rapid transit lines with stops and frequencies similar to those of Los Angeles's light rail system.\nThere are also smaller regional public transit systems that mainly serve specific cities or regions in Los Angeles County. For example, the Big Blue Bus provides extensive bus service in Santa Monica and western Los Angeles County, while Foothill Transit focuses on routes in the San Gabriel Valley in southeast Los Angeles County with one express route going into downtown Los Angeles. Los Angeles World Airports also runs two frequent FlyAway express bus routes (via freeways) from Los Angeles Union Station and Van Nuys to Los Angeles International Airport.\nWhile cash is accepted on all buses, the primary payment method for Los Angeles Metro Bus, Metro Busway, and 27 other regional bus agencies is a TAP card, a contactless stored-value card. According to the 2016 American Community Survey, 9.2% of working Los Angeles (city) residents made the journey to work via public transportation.\n\nRail\nThe Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority also operate a subway and light rail system across Los Angeles and its county. The system is called Los Angeles Metro Rail and consists of the B and D subway lines, as well as the A, C, E, and K light rail lines. TAP cards are required for all Metro Rail trips. As of the third quarter of 2023, the city's subway system is the ninth busiest in the United States, and its light rail system is the country's second busiest. In 2022, the system had a ridership of 57,299,800, or about 189,200 per weekday, in the third quarter of 2023.\nSince the opening of the first line, the A Line, in 1990, the system has been extended significantly, with more extensions currently in progress. Today, the system serves numerous areas across the county on 107.4 mi (172.8 km) of rail, including Long Beach, Pasadena, Santa Monica, Norwalk, El Segundo, North Hollywood, Inglewood, and Downtown Los Angeles. As of 2023, there are 101 stations in the Metro Rail system.\n\nLos Angeles is also center of its county's commuter rail system, Metrolink, which links Los Angeles to Ventura, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and San Diego Counties. The system consists of eight lines and 69 stations operating on 545.6 miles (878.1 kilometres) of track. Metrolink averages 42,600 trips per weekday, the busiest line being the San Bernardino Line. Apart from Metrolink, Los Angeles is also connected to other cities by intercity passenger trains from Amtrak on five different lines. One of the lines is the Pacific Surfliner route which operates multiple daily round trips between San Diego and San Luis Obispo, California through Union Station. It is Amtrak's busiest line outside the Northeast Corridor.The main rail station in the city is Union Station which opened in 1939, and it is the largest passenger rail terminal in the Western United States. The station is a major regional train station for Amtrak, Metrolink and Metro Rail. The station is Amtrak's fifth busiest station, having 1.4 million Amtrak boardings and de-boardings in 2019. Union Station also offers access to Metro Bus, Greyhound, LAX FlyAway, and other buses from different agencies.\n\nAirports\nThe main international and domestic airport serving Los Angeles is Los Angeles International Airport (IATA: LAX, ICAO: KLAX), commonly referred to by its airport code, LAX. It is located on the Westside of Los Angeles near the Sofi Stadium in Inglewood.\nOther major nearby commercial airports include:\n\n(IATA: ONT, ICAO: KONT) Ontario International Airport, owned by the city of Ontario, CA; serves the Inland Empire.\n(IATA: BUR, ICAO: KBUR) Hollywood Burbank Airport, jointly owned by the cities of Burbank, Glendale, and Pasadena.

Also called Los Angeles Harbor and WORLDPORT LA, the port complex occupies 7,500 acres (30 km2) of land and water along 43 miles (69 km) of waterfront. It adjoins the separate Port of Long Beach.\nThe sea ports of the Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach together make up the Los Angeles\/Long Beach Harbor. Together, both ports are the fifth busiest container port in the world, with a trade volume of over 14.2 million TEU's in 2008. Singly, the Port of Los Angeles is the busiest container port in the United States and the largest cruise ship center on the West Coast of the United States \u2013 The Port of Los Angeles's World Cruise Center served about 590,000 passengers in 2014.\nThere are also smaller, non-industrial harbors along Los Angeles's coastline. The port includes four bridges: the Vincent Thomas Bridge, Henry Ford Bridge, Long Beach International Gateway Bridge, and Commodore Schuyler F. Heim Bridge.

With roughly 3.9 million residents within the city limits as of 2020, It is the second-most populous city in the United States, behind only New York City; it is also the commercial, financial and cultural center of Southern California. Los Angeles has an ethnically and culturally diverse population, and is the principal city of a metropolitan area of 13.2 million people. Greater Los Angeles, which includes the Los Angeles and Riverside\u2013San Bernardino metropolitan areas, is a sprawling metropolis of over 20.6 million residents as of 2024.\nThe majority of the city proper lies in a basin in Southern California adjacent to the Pacific Ocean in the west and extending partly through the Santa Monica Mountains and north into the San Fernando Valley, with the city bordering the San Gabriel Valley to its east. It covers about 469 square miles (1,210 km2), and is the county seat of Los Angeles County, which is the most populous county in the United States with an estimated 9.86 million residents as of 2022. It is the fourth-most visited city in the U.S. with over 2.7 million visitors as of 2022.\nThe area that became Los Angeles was originally inhabited by the indigenous Tongva people and later claimed by Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo for Spain in 1542. The city was founded on September 4, 1781, under Spanish governor Felipe de Neve, on the village of Yaanga. It became a part of Mexico in 1821 following the Mexican War of Independence. In 1848, at the end of the Mexican\u2013American War, Los Angeles and the rest of California were purchased as part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and became part of the United States. Los Angeles was incorporated as a municipality on April 4, 1850, five months before California achieved statehood. The discovery of oil in the 1890s brought rapid growth to the city. The city was further expanded with the completion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913, which delivers water from Eastern California.\nLos Angeles has a diverse economy with a broad range of industries. Despite a steep exodus of film and television production since the COVID-19 pandemic, Los Angeles is still one of the largest hubs of American film production, the world's largest by revenue; the city is an important site in the history of film. It also has one of the busiest container ports in the Americas. In 2018, the Los Angeles metropolitan area had a gross metropolitan product of over $1.0 trillion, making it the city with the third-largest GDP in the world, after New York and Tokyo. Los Angeles hosted the Summer Olympics in 1932 and 1984, and will also host in 2028. Despite a business exodus from Downtown Los Angeles since the COVID-19 pandemic, the city's urban core is evolving as a cultural center with the world's largest showcase of architecture designed by Frank Gehry.\n\nToponymy\nOn September 4, 1781, a group of 44 settlers known as \"Los Pobladores\" founded the pueblo (town) they called El Pueblo de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora la Reina de los \u00c1ngeles, 'The Town of Our Lady the Queen of the Angels'. The original name of the settlement is disputed; the Guinness Book of World Records rendered it as \"El Pueblo de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora la Reina de los \u00c1ngeles de Porci\u00fancula\"; other sources have shortened or alternate versions of the longer name.\nThe local English pronunciation of the name of the city has varied over time. A 1953 article in the journal of the American Name Society asserts that the pronunciation  lawss AN-j\u0259l-\u0259s was established following the 1850 incorporation of the city and that since the 1880s the pronunciation  lohss ANG-g\u0259l-\u0259s emerged from a trend in California to give places Spanish, or Spanish-sounding, names and pronunciations. In 1908, librarian Charles Fletcher Lummis, who argued for the name's pronunciation with a hard g (), reported that there were at least 12 pronunciation variants. In the early 1900s, the Los Angeles Times advocated for pronouncing it Loce AHNG-hayl-ais (), approximating Spanish [los \u02c8a\u014bxeles], by printing the respelling under its masthead for several years. This did not find favor.\nSince the 1930s,  has been most common. In 1934, the United States Board on Geographic Names decreed that this pronunciation be used by the federal government. This was also endorsed in 1952 by a \"jury\" appointed by Mayor Fletcher Bowron to devise an official pronunciation.\nCommon pronunciations in the United Kingdom include  loss AN-jil-eez, -\u2060iz, -\u2060iss. Phonetician Jack Windsor Lewis described the most common one,  , as a spelling pronunciation based on analogy to Greek words ending in -\u200des, \"reflecting a time when the classics were familiar if Spanish was not\".\n\nHistory\nIndigenous history\nThe settlement of Indigenous Californians in the modern Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley was dominated by the Tongva (now also known as the Gabriele\u00f1o since the era of Spanish colonization). The historic center of Tongva power in the region was the settlement of Yaanga (Tongva: Iy\u00e1ang\u1e9a), meaning \"place of the poison oak\", which would one day be the site where the Spanish founded the Pueblo de Los \u00c1ngeles. Iy\u00e1ang\u1e9a has also been translated as \"the valley of smoke\".\n\nSpanish rule\nMaritime explorer Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo claimed the area of southern California for the Spanish Empire in 1542, while on an official military exploring expedition, as he was moving northward along the Pacific coast from earlier colonizing bases of New Spain in Central and South America. Gaspar de Portol\u00e0 and Franciscan missionary Juan Cresp\u00ed reached the present site of Los Angeles on August 2, 1769.\n\nIn 1771, Franciscan friar Jun\u00edpero Serra directed the building of the Mission San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel, the first mission in the area. On September 4, 1781, a group of 44 settlers known as \"Los Pobladores\" founded the pueblo (town) they called El Pueblo de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora la Reina de los \u00c1ngeles, 'The Town of Our Lady the Queen of the Angels'. The present-day city has the largest Roman Catholic archdiocese in the United States. Two-thirds of the Mexican or (New Spain) settlers were mestizo or mulatto, a mixture of African, indigenous and European ancestry. The settlement remained a small ranch town for decades, but by 1820, the population had increased to about 650 residents. Today, the pueblo is commemorated in the historic district of Los Angeles Pueblo Plaza and Olvera Street, the oldest part of Los Angeles.\n\nMexican rule\nNew Spain achieved its independence from the Spanish Empire in 1821, and the pueblo now existed within the new Mexican Republic. During Mexican rule, Governor P\u00edo Pico made Los Angeles the regional capital of Alta California. By this time, the new republic introduced more secularization acts within the Los Angeles region. In 1846, during the wider Mexican-American war, marines from the United States occupied the pueblo. This resulted in the siege of Los Angeles where 150 Mexican militias fought the occupiers which eventually surrendered.\nMexican rule ended during following the American Conquest of California, part of the larger Mexican-American War. Americans took control from the Californios after a series of battles, culminating with the signing of the Treaty of Cahuenga on January 13, 1847. The Mexican Cession was formalized in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, which ceded Los Angeles and the rest of Alta California to the United States.\n\nPost-Conquest era\nRailroads arrived with the completion of the transcontinental Southern Pacific line from New Orleans to Los Angeles in 1876 and the Santa Fe Railroad in 1885. Petroleum was discovered in the city and surrounding area in 1892, and by 1923, the discoveries had helped California become the country's largest oil producer, accounting for about one-quarter of the world's petroleum output.\nBy 1900, the population had grown to more than 102,000, putting pressure on the city's water supply. The completion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913, under the supervision of William Mulholland, ensured the continued growth of the city. Because of clauses in the city's charter that prevented the City of Los Angeles from selling or providing water from the aqueduct to any area outside its borders, many adjacent cities and communities felt compelled to join Los Angeles.\n\nLos Angeles created the first municipal zoning ordinance in the United States. On September 14, 1908, the Los Angeles City Council promulgated residential and industrial land use zones. The new ordinance established three residential zones of a single type, where industrial uses were prohibited. The proscriptions included barns, lumber yards, and any industrial land use employing machine-powered equipment. These laws were enforced against industrial properties after the fact. These prohibitions were in addition to existing activities that were already regulated as nuisances. These included explosives warehousing, gas works, oil drilling, slaughterhouses, and tanneries. Los Angeles City Council also designated seven industrial zones within the city. However, between 1908 and 1915, the Los Angeles City Council created various exceptions to the broad proscriptions that applied to these three residential zones, and as a consequence, some industrial uses emerged within them. There are two differences between the 1908 Residence District Ordinance and later zoning laws in the United States. First, the 1908 laws did not establish a comprehensive zoning map as the 1916 New York City Zoning Ordinance did. Second, the residential zones did not distinguish types of housing; they treated apartments, hotels, and detached-single-family housing equally.\nIn 1910, Hollywood merged into Los Angeles, with 10 movie companies already operating in the city at the time. By 1921, more than 80 percent of the world's film industry was concentrated in L.A. The money generated by the industry kept the city insulated from much of the economic loss suffered by the rest of the country during the Great Depression.\nBy 1930, the population surpassed one million. In 1932, the city hosted the Summer Olympics.\n\nPost-WWII\nDuring World War II Los Angeles was a major center of wartime manufacturing, such as shipbuilding and aircraft. Calship built hundreds of Liberty Ships and Victory Ships on Terminal Island, and the Los Angeles area was the headquarters of six of the country's major aircraft manufacturers (Douglas Aircraft Company, Hughes Aircraft, Lockheed, North American Aviation, Northrop Corporation, and Vultee). During the war, more aircraft were produced in one year than in all the pre-war years since the Wright brothers flew the first airplane in 1903, combined. Manufacturing in Los Angeles skyrocketed, and as William S. Knudsen, of the National Defense Advisory Commission put it, \"We won because we smothered the enemy in an avalanche of production, the like of which he had never seen, nor dreamed possible.\"\nAfter the end of World War II Los Angeles grew more rapidly than ever, sprawling into the San Fernando Valley. The expansion of the state owned Interstate Highway System during the 1950s and 1960s helped propel suburban growth and signaled the demise of the city's privately owned electrified rail system, once the world's largest.\n\nAs a consequence of World War II, suburban growth, and population density, many amusement parks were built and operated in this area. An example is Beverly Park, which was located at the corner of Beverly Boulevard and La Cienega before being closed and substituted by the Beverly Center.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, Los Angeles substantially reduced the amount of housing that could be built by drastically downzoning the city. In 1960, the city had a total zoned capacity for approximately 10 million people. By 1990, that capacity had fallen to 4.5 million as a result of policy decisions to ban housing through zoning.\nRacial tensions led to the Watts riots in 1965, resulting in 34 deaths and over 1,000 injuries.\n\nIn 1969, California became the birthplace of the Internet, as the first ARPANET transmission was sent from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to the Stanford Research Institute in Menlo Park.\nIn 1973, Tom Bradley was elected as the city's first African American mayor, serving for five terms until retiring in 1993. Other events in the city during the 1970s included the Symbionese Liberation Army's South Central standoff in 1974 and the Hillside Stranglers murder cases in 1977\u20131978.\nIn early 1984, the city surpassed Chicago in population, thus becoming the second largest city in the United States.\nIn 1984, the city hosted the Summer Olympic Games for the second time. Despite being boycotted by 14 Communist countries, the 1984 Olympics became more financially successful than any previous, and the second Olympics to turn a profit; the other, according to an analysis of contemporary newspaper reports, was the 1932 Summer Olympics, also held in Los Angeles.\n\nRacial tensions erupted on April 29, 1992, with the acquittal by a Simi Valley jury of four Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officers captured on videotape beating Rodney King, culminating in large-scale riots.\nIn 1994, the magnitude 6.7 Northridge earthquake shook the city, causing $12.5 billion in damage and 72 deaths. The century ended with the Rampart scandal, one of the most extensive documented cases of police misconduct in American history.\n\n21st century\nIn 2002, Mayor James Hahn led the campaign against secession, resulting in voters defeating efforts by the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood to secede from the city.\nIn 2022, Karen Bass became the city's first female mayor, making Los Angeles the largest U.S. city to have ever had a woman as mayor.\nLos Angeles will host the 2028 Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games, making Los Angeles the third city to host the Olympics three times.\n\nGeography\nTopography\nThe city of Los Angeles covers a total area of 502.7 square miles (1,302 km2), comprising 468.7 square miles (1,214 km2) of land and 34.0 square miles (88 km2) of water. The city extends for 44 miles (71 km) from north to south and for 29 miles (47 km) from east to west. The perimeter of the city is 342 miles (550 km).\nLos Angeles is both flat and hilly. The highest point in the city proper is Mount Lukens at 5,074 ft (1,547 m), located in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains at the north extent of the Crescenta Valley. The eastern end of the Santa Monica Mountains stretches from Downtown to the Pacific Ocean and separates the Los Angeles Basin from the San Fernando Valley. Other hilly parts of Los Angeles include the Mt. Washington area north of Downtown, eastern parts such as Boyle Heights, the Crenshaw district around the Baldwin Hills, and the San Pedro district.\nSurrounding the city are much higher mountains. Immediately to the north lie the San Gabriel Mountains, which is a popular recreation area for Angelenos. Its high point is Mount San Antonio, locally known as Mount Baldy, which reaches 10,064 feet (3,068 m). Further afield, the highest point in southern California is San Gorgonio Mountain, 81 miles (130 km) east of downtown Los Angeles, with a height of 11,503 feet (3,506 m).\nThe Los Angeles River, which is largely seasonal, is the primary drainage channel. It was straightened and lined in 51 miles (82 km) of concrete by the Army Corps of Engineers to act as a flood control channel. The river begins in the Canoga Park district of the city, flows east from the San Fernando Valley along the north edge of the Santa Monica Mountains, and turns south through the city center, flowing to its mouth in the Port of Long Beach at the Pacific Ocean. The smaller Ballona Creek flows into the Santa Monica Bay at Playa del Rey.\n\nVegetation\nLos Angeles is rich in native plant species partly because of its diversity of habitats, including beaches, wetlands, and mountains. The most prevalent plant communities are coastal sage scrub, chaparral shrubland, and riparian woodland. Native plants include: the California poppy, matilija poppy, toyon, Ceanothus, Chamise, Coast Live Oak, sycamore, willow and Giant Wildrye. Many of these native species, such as the Los Angeles sunflower, have become so rare as to be considered endangered. Mexican Fan Palms, Canary Island Palms, Queen Palms, Date Palms, and California Fan Palms are common in the Los Angeles area, although only the last is native to California, though still not native to the City of Los Angeles.\nLos Angeles has a number of official flora:\n\nthe official tree of Los Angeles is the Coral Tree (Erythrina afra)\nthe official flower is the Bird of Paradise (Strelitzia reginae)\nthe official plant is toyon (Heteromeles arbutifolia)\n\nFauna\nThe city has an urban population of bobcats (Lynx rufus). Mange is a common problem in this population. Although Serieys et al. 2014 find selection of immune genetics at several loci they do not demonstrate that this produces a real difference which helps the bobcats to survive future mange outbreaks.\n\nGeology\nLos Angeles is subject to earthquakes because of its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire. The geologic instability has produced numerous faults, which cause approximately 10,000 earthquakes annually in Southern California, though most of them are too small to be felt. The strike-slip San Andreas Fault system, which sits at the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, passes through the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The segment of the fault passing through Southern California experiences a major earthquake roughly every 110 to 140 years, and seismologists have warned about the next \"big one\", as the last major earthquake was the 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake. The Los Angeles basin and metropolitan area are also at risk from blind thrust earthquakes. Major earthquakes that have hit the Los Angeles area include the 1933 Long Beach, 1971 San Fernando, 1987 Whittier Narrows, and the 1994 Northridge events. All but a few are of low intensity and are not felt. The USGS has released the UCERF California earthquake forecast, which models earthquake occurrence in California. Parts of the city are also vulnerable to tsunamis; harbor areas were damaged by waves from Aleutian Islands earthquake in 1946, Valdivia earthquake in 1960, Alaska earthquake in 1964, Chile earthquake in 2010 and Japan earthquake in 2011.\n\nCityscape\nThe city is divided into many different districts and neighborhoods, some of which had been separately incorporated cities that eventually merged with Los Angeles. These neighborhoods were developed piecemeal, and are well-defined enough that the city has signage which marks nearly all of them.\n\nOverview\nThe city's street patterns generally follow a grid plan, with uniform block lengths and occasional roads that cut across blocks. However, this is complicated by rugged terrain, which has necessitated having different grids for each of the valleys that Los Angeles covers. Major streets are designed to move large volumes of traffic through many parts of the city, many of which are extremely long; Sepulveda Boulevard is 43 miles (69 km) long, while Foothill Boulevard is over 60 miles (97 km) long, reaching as far east as San Bernardino. Drivers in Los Angeles suffer from one of the worst rush hour periods in the world, according to an annual traffic index by navigation system maker, TomTom. LA drivers spend an additional 92 hours in traffic each year. During the peak rush hour, there is 80% congestion, according to the index.\nLos Angeles is often characterized by the presence of low-rise buildings, in contrast to New York City. Outside of a few centers such as Downtown, Warner Center, Century City, Koreatown, Miracle Mile, Hollywood, and Westwood, skyscrapers and high-rise buildings are not common in Los Angeles. The few skyscrapers built outside of those areas often stand out above the rest of the surrounding landscape. Most construction is done in separate units, rather than wall-to-wall. However, Downtown Los Angeles itself has many buildings over 30 stories, with fourteen over 50 stories, and two over 70 stories, the tallest of which is the Wilshire Grand Center.\n\n\tSelection of neighborhoods in Los Angeles\n\nClimate\nLos Angeles has a two-season semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BSh) with dry summers and very mild winters, but it receives more annual precipitation than most semi-arid climates, narrowly missing the boundary of a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csb on the coast, Csa otherwise). Daytime temperatures are generally temperate all year round. In winter, they average around 68 \u00b0F (20 \u00b0C). Autumn months tend to be hot, with major heat waves a common occurrence in September and October, while the spring months tend to be cooler and experience more precipitation. Los Angeles has plenty of sunshine throughout the year, with an average of only 35 days with measurable precipitation annually.\nTemperatures in the coastal basin exceed 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) on a dozen or so days in the year, from one day a month in April, May, June and November to three days a month in July, August, October and to five days in September. Temperatures in the San Fernando and San Gabriel Valleys are considerably warmer. Temperatures are subject to substantial daily swings; in inland areas the difference between the average daily low and the average daily high is over 30 \u00b0F (17 \u00b0C). The average annual temperature of the sea is 63 \u00b0F (17 \u00b0C), from 58 \u00b0F (14 \u00b0C) in January to 68 \u00b0F (20 \u00b0C) in August. Hours of sunshine total more than 3,000 per year, from an average of 7 hours of sunshine per day in December to an average of 12 in July.\nDue to the mountainous terrain of the surrounding region, the Los Angeles area contains a large number of distinct microclimates, causing extreme variations in temperature in close physical proximity to each other. For example, the average July maximum temperature at the Santa Monica Pier is 70 \u00b0F (21 \u00b0C) whereas it is 95 \u00b0F (35 \u00b0C) in Canoga Park, 15 miles (24 km) away. The city, like much of the Southern Californian coast, is subject to a late spring\/early summer weather phenomenon called \"June Gloom\". This involves overcast or foggy skies in the morning that yield to sun by early afternoon.\n\nMore recently, statewide droughts in California have further strained the city's water security. Downtown Los Angeles averages 14.67 in (373 mm) of precipitation annually, mainly occurring between November and March, generally in the form of moderate rain showers, but sometimes as heavy rainfall during winter storms. Rainfall is usually higher in the hills and coastal slopes of the mountains because of orographic uplift. Summer days are usually rainless. Rarely, an incursion of moist air from the south or east can bring brief thunderstorms in late summer, especially to the mountains. The coast gets slightly less rainfall, while the inland and mountain areas get considerably more. Years of average rainfall are rare. The usual pattern is a year-to-year variability, with a short string of dry years of 5\u201310 in (130\u2013250 mm) rainfall, followed by one or two wet years with more than 20 in (510 mm). Wet years are usually associated with warm water El Ni\u00f1o conditions in the Pacific, dry years with cooler water La Ni\u00f1a episodes. A series of rainy days can bring floods to the lowlands and mudslides to the hills, especially after wildfires have denuded the slopes.\n\nBoth freezing temperatures and snowfall are extremely rare in the city basin and along the coast, with the last occurrence of a 32 \u00b0F (0 \u00b0C) reading at the downtown station being January 29, 1979; freezing temperatures occur nearly every year in valley locations while the mountains within city limits typically receive snowfall every winter. The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was 2.0 inches (5 cm) on January 15, 1932. While the most recent snowfall occurred in February 2019, the first snowfall since 1962, with snow falling in areas adjacent to Los Angeles as recently as January 2021. Brief, localized instances of hail can occur on rare occasions, but are more common than snowfall. At the official downtown station, the highest recorded temperature is 113 \u00b0F (45 \u00b0C) on September 27, 2010, while the lowest is 28 \u00b0F (\u22122 \u00b0C), on January 4, 1949. Within the City of Los Angeles, the highest temperature ever officially recorded is 121 \u00b0F (49 \u00b0C), on September 6, 2020, at the weather station at Pierce College in the San Fernando Valley neighborhood of Woodland Hills. During autumn and winter, Santa Ana winds sometimes bring much warmer and drier conditions to Los Angeles, and raise wildfire risk.\n\nEnvironmental issues\nOwing to geography, heavy reliance on automobiles, and the Los Angeles\/Long Beach port complex, Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog. The Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley are susceptible to atmospheric inversion, which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles, airplanes, locomotives, shipping, manufacturing, and other sources.\n\nThe smog season lasts from approximately May to October. While other large cities rely on rain to clear smog, Los Angeles gets only 15 inches (380 mm) of rain each year: pollution accumulates over many consecutive days. Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation, including the Clean Air Act. When the act was passed, California was unable to create a State Implementation Plan that would enable it to meet the new air quality standards, largely because of the level of pollution in Los Angeles generated by older vehicles. More recently, the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating low-emission vehicles. Smog is expected to continue to drop in the coming years because of aggressive steps to reduce it, which include electric and hybrid cars, improvements in mass transit, and other measures.\nThe number of Stage 1 smog alerts in Los Angeles has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium. Despite improvement, the 2006 and 2007 annual reports of the American Lung Association ranked the city as the most polluted in the country with short-term particle pollution and year-round particle pollution. In 2008, the city was ranked the second most polluted and again had the highest year-round particulate pollution. The city met its goal of providing 20 percent of the city's power from renewable sources in 2010. The American Lung Association's 2013 survey ranks the metro area as having the nation's worst smog, and fourth in both short-term and year-round pollution amounts.\nLos Angeles is also home to the nation's largest urban oil field. There are more than 700 active oil wells within 1,500 feet (460 m) of homes, churches, schools and hospitals in the city, a situation about which the EPA has voiced serious concerns.\n\nDemographics\nThe 2010 U.S. census reported Los Angeles had a population of 3,792,621. The population density was 8,092.3 people per square mile (3,124.5 people\/km2). The age distribution was 874,525 people (23.1%) under 18, 434,478 people (11.5%) from 18 to 24, 1,209,367 people (31.9%) from 25 to 44, 877,555 people (23.1%) from 45 to 64, and 396,696 people (10.5%) who were 65 or older. The median age was 34.1 years. For every 100 females, there were 99.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 97.6 males.\nThere were 1,413,995 housing units\u2014up from 1,298,350 during 2005\u20132009\u2014at an average density of 2,812.8 households per square mile (1,086.0 households\/km2), of which 503,863 (38.2%) were owner-occupied, and 814,305 (61.8%) were occupied by renters. The homeowner vacancy rate was 2.1%; the rental vacancy rate was 6.1%. 1,535,444 people (40.5% of the population) lived in owner-occupied housing units and 2,172,576 people (57.3%) lived in rental housing units.\nAccording to the 2010 United States Census, Los Angeles had a median household income of $49,497, with 22.0% of the population living below the federal poverty line.\n\nRace and ethnicity\nAccording to the 2010 census, the racial makeup of Los Angeles included: 1,888,158 Whites (49.8%), 365,118 African Americans (9.6%), 28,215 Native Americans (0.7%), 426,959 Asians (11.3%), 5,577 Pacific Islanders (0.1%), 902,959 from other races (23.8%), and 175,635 (4.6%) from two or more races. There were 1,838,822 Hispanic or Latino residents of any race (48.5%). Los Angeles is home to people from more than 140 countries speaking 224 different identified languages. Ethnic enclaves like Chinatown, Historic Filipinotown, Koreatown, Little Armenia, Little Ethiopia, Tehrangeles, Little Tokyo, Little Bangladesh, and Thai Town provide examples of the polyglot character of Los Angeles.\n\nNon-Hispanic Whites were 28.7% of the population in 2010, compared to 86.3% in 1940. The majority of the Non-Hispanic White population is living in areas along the Pacific coast as well as in neighborhoods near and on the Santa Monica Mountains from the Pacific Palisades to Los Feliz.\nMexican ancestry makes up the largest ethnic group of Hispanics at 31.9% of the city's population, followed by those of Salvadoran (6.0%) and Guatemalan (3.6%) heritage. The Hispanic population has a long established Mexican-American and Central American community and is spread throughout the entire city of Los Angeles and its metropolitan area. It is most heavily concentrated in regions around Downtown, such as East Los Angeles, Northeast Los Angeles and Westlake. Furthermore, a vast majority of residents in neighborhoods in eastern South Los Angeles towards Downey are of Hispanic origin.\n\nThe largest Asian ethnic groups are Filipinos (3.2%) and Koreans (2.9%), which have their own established ethnic enclaves\u2014Koreatown in the Wilshire Center and Historic Filipinotown. Chinese people, which make up 1.8% of Los Angeles's population, reside mostly outside of Los Angeles city limits, in the San Gabriel Valley of eastern Los Angeles County, but make a sizable presence in the city, notably in Chinatown. Chinatown and Thaitown are also home to many Thais and Cambodians, which make up 0.3% and 0.1% of Los Angeles's population, respectively. The Japanese comprise 0.9% of the city's population and have an established Little Tokyo in the city's downtown, and another significant community of Japanese Americans is in the Sawtelle district of West Los Angeles. Vietnamese make up 0.5% of Los Angeles's population. Indians make up 0.9% of the city's population. Los Angeles is also home to Armenians, Assyrians, and Iranians, many of whom live in enclaves like Little Armenia and Tehrangeles.\nAfrican Americans have been the predominant ethnic group in South Los Angeles, which has emerged as the largest African-American community in the western United States since the 1960s. The neighborhoods of South Los Angeles with highest concentration of African Americans include Crenshaw, Baldwin Hills, Leimert Park, Hyde Park, Gramercy Park, Manchester Square and Watts. There is also a sizable Eritrean and Ethiopian community in the Fairfax region.\nLos Angeles has the second-largest Mexican, Armenian, Salvadoran, Filipino, and Guatemalan populations by city in the world, the third-largest Canadian population in the world, and has the largest Japanese, Iranian\/Persian, Cambodian, and Romani (Gypsy) populations in the country. The Italian community is concentrated in San Pedro.\nMost of Los Angeles' foreign-born population were born in Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, the Philippines and South Korea.\n\nReligion\nAccording to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, Christianity is the most prevalently practiced religion in Los Angeles (65%). The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles is the largest archdiocese in the country. Cardinal Roger Mahony, as the archbishop, oversaw construction of the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, which opened in September 2002 in Downtown Los Angeles.\nIn 2011, the once common, but ultimately lapsed, custom of conducting a procession and Mass in honor of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de los \u00c1ngeles, in commemoration of the founding of the City of Los Angeles in 1781, was revived by the Queen of Angels Foundation and its founder Mark Albert, with the support of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles as well as several civic leaders. The recently revived custom is a continuation of the original processions and Masses that commenced on the first anniversary of the founding of Los Angeles in 1782 and continued for nearly a century thereafter.\n\nWith 621,000 Jews in the metropolitan area, the region has the second-largest population of Jews in the United States, after New York City. Many of Los Angeles's Jews now live on the Westside and in the San Fernando Valley, though Boyle Heights once had a large Jewish population prior to World War II due to restrictive housing covenants. Major Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods include Hancock Park, Pico-Robertson, and Valley Village, while Jewish Israelis are well represented in the Encino and Tarzana neighborhoods, and Persian Jews in Beverly Hills. Many varieties of Judaism are represented in the greater Los Angeles area, including Reform, Conservative, Orthodox, and Reconstructionist. The Breed Street Shul in East Los Angeles, built in 1923, was the largest synagogue west of Chicago in its early decades; it is no longer in daily use as a synagogue and is being converted to a museum and community center. The Kabbalah Centre also has a presence in the city.\nThe International Church of the Foursquare Gospel was founded in Los Angeles by Aimee Semple McPherson in 1923 and remains headquartered there to this day. For many years, the church convened at Angelus Temple, which, at its construction, was one of the largest churches in the country.\n\nLos Angeles has had a rich and influential Protestant tradition. The first Protestant service in Los Angeles was a Methodist meeting held in a private home in 1850 and the oldest Protestant church still operating, First Congregational Church, was founded in 1867. In the early 1900s the Bible Institute Of Los Angeles published the founding documents of the Christian Fundamentalist movement and the Azusa Street Revival launched Pentecostalism. The Metropolitan Community Church also had its origins in the Los Angeles area. Important churches in the city include First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood, Bel Air Presbyterian Church, First African Methodist Episcopal Church of Los Angeles, West Angeles Church of God in Christ, Second Baptist Church, Crenshaw Christian Center, McCarty Memorial Christian Church, and First Congregational Church.\n\nThe Los Angeles California Temple, the second-largest temple operated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is on Santa Monica Boulevard in the Westwood neighborhood of Los Angeles. Dedicated in 1956, it was the first temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints built in California and it was the largest in the world when completed.\nThe Hollywood region of Los Angeles also has several significant headquarters, churches, and the Celebrity Center of Scientology.\nBecause of Los Angeles's large multi-ethnic population, a wide variety of faiths are practiced, including Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Zoroastrianism, Sikhism, Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed, various Eastern Orthodox Churches, Sufism, Shintoism, Taoism, Confucianism, Chinese folk religion and countless others. Immigrants from Asia for example, have formed a number of significant Buddhist congregations making the city home to the greatest variety of Buddhists in the world. The first Buddhist joss house was founded in the city in 1875. Atheism and other secular beliefs are also common, as the city is the largest in the Western U.S. Unchurched Belt.\n\nHomelessness\nAs of January 2020, there are 41,290 homeless people in the City of Los Angeles, comprising roughly 62% of the homeless population of LA County. This is an increase of 14.2% over the previous year (with a 12.7% increase in the overall homeless population of LA County). The epicenter of homelessness in Los Angeles is the Skid Row neighborhood, which contains 8,000 homeless people, one of the largest stable populations of homeless people in the United States. The increased homeless population in Los Angeles has been attributed to lack of housing affordability and to substance abuse. Almost 60 percent of the 82,955 people who became newly homeless in 2019 said their homelessness was because of economic hardship. In Los Angeles, black people are roughly four times more likely to experience homelessness.\n\nEconomy\nThe economy of Los Angeles is driven by international trade, entertainment (television, motion pictures, video games, music recording, and production), aerospace, technology, petroleum, fashion, apparel, and tourism. Other significant industries include finance, telecommunications, law, healthcare, and transportation. In the 2017 Global Financial Centres Index, Los Angeles was ranked the 19th most competitive financial center in the world and sixth most competitive in the U.S. after New York City, San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, and Washington, D.C. Although a business exodus has occurred away from Downtown Los Angeles since the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts are underway to re-invent the city's urban core as a cultural center with the world's largest showcase of architecture designed by Frank Gehry.\nOf the five major film studios, only Paramount Pictures is within Los Angeles' city limits; it is located in the so-called Thirty-Mile Zone of entertainment headquarters in Southern California.\nLos Angeles is the largest manufacturing center in the United States. The contiguous ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach together comprise the busiest port in the United States by some measures and the fifth busiest port in the world, vital to trade within the Pacific Rim.\n\nThe Los Angeles metropolitan area has a gross metropolitan product of over $1.0 trillion (as of 2018), making it the third-largest economic metropolitan area in the world, after New York and Tokyo. Los Angeles has been classified an \"alpha world city\" according to a 2012 study by a group at Loughborough University.\nThe Department of Cannabis Regulation enforces cannabis legislation after the legalization of the sale and distribution of cannabis in 2016. As of October 2019, more than 300 existing cannabis businesses (both retailers and their suppliers) have been granted approval to operate in what is considered the nation's largest market.\nAs of 2018, Los Angeles is home to three Fortune 500 companies: AECOM, CBRE Group, and Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co. Other companies headquartered in Los Angeles and the surrounding metropolitan area include The Aerospace Corporation, California Pizza Kitchen, Capital Group Companies, Deluxe Entertainment Services Group, Dine Brands Global, DreamWorks Animation, Dollar Shave Club, Fandango Media, Farmers Insurance Group, Forever 21, Hulu, Panda Express, SpaceX, Ubisoft Film & Television, The Walt Disney Company, Universal Pictures, Warner Bros., Warner Music Group, and Trader Joe's.\n\nArts and culture\nLos Angeles is often billed as the creative capital of the world because one in every six of its residents works in a creative industry and there are more artists, writers, filmmakers, actors, dancers and musicians living and working in Los Angeles than any other city at any other time in world history. The city is also known for its prolific murals.\n\nLandmarks\nThe architecture of Los Angeles is influenced by its Spanish, Mexican, and American roots. Popular styles in the city include Spanish Colonial Revival style, Mission Revival style, California Churrigueresque style, Mediterranean Revival style, Art Deco style, and Mid-Century Modern style, among others.\nImportant landmarks in Los Angeles include the Hollywood Sign, Walt Disney Concert Hall, Capitol Records Building, the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, Angels Flight, Grauman's Chinese Theatre, Dolby Theatre, Griffith Observatory, Getty Center, Getty Villa, Stahl House, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, L.A.

According to the USC Stevens Institute for Innovation, \"there are more than 1,100 annual theatrical productions and 21 openings every week.\" The Los Angeles Music Center is \"one of the three largest performing arts centers in the nation\", with more than 1.3 million visitors per year. The Walt Disney Concert Hall, centerpiece of the Music Center, is home to the prestigious Los Angeles Philharmonic. Notable organizations such as Center Theatre Group, the Los Angeles Master Chorale, and the Los Angeles Opera are also resident companies of the Music Center. Talent is locally cultivated at premier institutions such as the Colburn School and the USC Thornton School of Music.\n\nThe city's Hollywood neighborhood has been recognized as the center of the motion picture industry, having held this distinction since the early 20th century, and the Los Angeles area is also associated with being the center of the television industry. The city is home to major film studios as well as major record labels. Los Angeles plays host to the annual Academy Awards, the Primetime Emmy Awards, the Grammy Awards as well as many other entertainment industry awards shows. Los Angeles is the site of the USC School of Cinematic Arts which is the oldest film school in the United States.\n\nMuseums and galleries\nThere are 841 museums and art galleries in Los Angeles County, more museums per capita than any other city in the U.S. Some of the notable museums are the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (the largest art museum in the Western United States), the Getty Center (part of the J. Paul Getty Trust, the world's wealthiest art institution), the Petersen Automotive Museum, the Huntington Library, the Natural History Museum, the Battleship Iowa, The Broad, which houses over 2,000 works of contemporary art and the Museum of Contemporary Art. A significant number of art galleries are on Gallery Row, and tens of thousands attend the monthly Downtown Art Walk there.\n\nLibraries\nThe Los Angeles Public Library system operates 72 public libraries in the city. Enclaves of unincorporated areas are served by branches of the County of Los Angeles Public Library, many of which are within walking distance to residents.\n\nCuisine\nLos Angeles' food culture is a fusion of global cuisine brought on by the city's rich immigrant history and population. As of 2022, the Michelin Guide recognized 10 restaurants granting 2 restaurants two stars and eight restaurants one star.\nLatin American immigrants, particularly Mexican immigrants, brought tacos, burritos, quesadillas, tortas, tamales, and enchiladas served from food trucks and stands, taquerias, and caf\u00e9s. Asian restaurants, many immigrant-owned, exist throughout the city with hotspots in Chinatown, Koreatown, and Little Tokyo. Los Angeles also carries an outsized offering of vegan, vegetarian, and plant-based options.\n\nSports\nLos Angeles and its metropolitan area are the home of eleven top-level professional sports teams, several of which play in neighboring communities but use Los Angeles in their name. These teams include the Los Angeles Dodgers and Los Angeles Angels of Major League Baseball (MLB), the Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Chargers of the National Football League (NFL), the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers of the National Basketball Association (NBA), the Los Angeles Kings and Anaheim Ducks of the National Hockey League (NHL), the Los Angeles Galaxy and Los Angeles FC of Major League Soccer (MLS), the Los Angeles Sparks of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), the SoCal Lashings of Minor League Cricket (MiLC) and the Los Angeles Knight Riders of Major League Cricket (MLC).\nOther notable sports teams include the UCLA Bruins and the USC Trojans in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), both of which are Division I teams in the Pac-12 Conference, but will soon be moving to the Big Ten Conference.\n\nLos Angeles is the second-largest city in the United States but hosted no NFL team between 1995 and 2015. At one time, the Los Angeles area hosted two NFL teams: the Rams and the Raiders. Both left the city in 1995, with the Rams moving to St. Louis, and the Raiders moving back to their original home of Oakland. After 21 seasons in St. Louis, on January 12, 2016, the NFL announced the Rams would be moving back to Los Angeles for the 2016 NFL season with its home games played at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for four seasons. Prior to 1995, the Rams played their home games in the Coliseum from 1946 to 1979 which made them the first professional sports team to play in Los Angeles, and then moved to Anaheim Stadium from 1980 until 1994. The San Diego Chargers announced on January 12, 2017, that they would also relocate back to Los Angeles (the first since its inaugural season in 1960) and become the Los Angeles Chargers beginning in the 2017 NFL season and played at Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, California for three seasons. The Rams and the Chargers would soon move to the newly built SoFi Stadium, located in nearby Inglewood during the 2020 season.\n\nLos Angeles boasts a number of sports venues, including Dodger Stadium, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, BMO Stadium and the Crypto.com Arena. The Forum, SoFi Stadium, Dignity Health Sports Park, the Rose Bowl, Angel Stadium, Honda Center, and Intuit Dome are also in adjacent cities and cities in Los Angeles's metropolitan area.\nLos Angeles has twice hosted the Summer Olympic Games: in 1932 and in 1984, and will host the games for a third time in 2028. Los Angeles will be the third city after London (1908, 1948 and 2012) and Paris (1900, 1924 and 2024) to host the Olympic Games three times. When the tenth Olympic Games were hosted in 1932, the former 10th Street was renamed Olympic Blvd. Los Angeles also hosted the Deaflympics in 1985 and Special Olympics World Summer Games in 2015.\n\nEight NFL Super Bowls were also held in the city and its surrounding areas - two at the Memorial Coliseum (the first Super Bowl, I and VII), five at the Rose Bowl in suburban Pasadena (XI, XIV, XVII, XXI, and XXVII), and one at the suburban Inglewood (LVI). The Rose Bowl also hosts an annual and highly prestigious NCAA college football game called the Rose Bowl, which happens every New Year's Day.\nLos Angeles also hosted eight FIFA World Cup soccer games at the Rose Bowl in 1994, including the final, where Brazil won. The Rose Bowl also hosted four matches in the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup, including the final, where the United States won against China on penalty kicks. This was the game where Brandi Chastain took her shirt off after she scored the tournament-winning penalty kick, creating an iconic image. Los Angeles will be one of eleven U.S. host cities for the 2026 FIFA World Cup with matches set to be held at SoFi Stadium.\nLos Angeles is one of six North American cities to have won championships in all five of its major leagues (MLB, NFL, NHL, NBA and MLS), having completed the feat with the Kings' 2012 Stanley Cup title.\n\nGovernment\nLos Angeles is a charter city as opposed to a general law city. The current charter was adopted on June 8, 1999, and has been amended many times. The elected government consists of the Los Angeles City Council and the mayor of Los Angeles, which operate under a mayor\u2013council government, as well as the city attorney (not to be confused with the district attorney, a county office) and controller. The mayor is Karen Bass. There are 15 city council districts.\nThe city has many departments and appointed officers, including the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), the Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners, the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD), the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (HACLA), the Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT), and the Los Angeles Public Library (LAPL).\nThe charter of the City of Los Angeles ratified by voters in 1999 created a system of advisory neighborhood councils that would represent the diversity of stakeholders, defined as those who live, work or own property in the neighborhood. The neighborhood councils are relatively autonomous and spontaneous in that they identify their own boundaries, establish their own bylaws, and elect their own officers. There are about 90 neighborhood councils.\nResidents of Los Angeles elect supervisors for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th supervisorial districts.\n\nFederal and state representation\nIn the California State Assembly, Los Angeles is split between fourteen districts. In the California State Senate, the city is split between eight districts. In the United States House of Representatives, it is split among nine congressional districts.\n\nCrime\nIn 1992, the city of Los Angeles recorded 1,092 murders. Los Angeles experienced a significant decline in crime in the 1990s and late 2000s and reached a 50-year low in 2009 with 314 homicides. This is a rate of 7.85 per 100,000 population\u2014a major decrease from 1980 when a homicide rate of 34.2 per 100,000 was reported. This included 15 officer-involved shootings. One shooting led to the death of a SWAT team member, Randal Simmons, the first in LAPD's history. Los Angeles in the year of 2013 totaled 251 murders, a decrease of 16 percent from the previous year. Police speculate the drop resulted from a number of factors, including young people spending more time online. In 2021, murders rose to the highest level since 2008 and there were 348.\nIn 2015, it was revealed that the LAPD had been under-reporting crime for eight years, making the crime rate in the city appear much lower than it really was.\nThe Dragna crime family and Mickey Cohen dominated organized crime in the city during the Prohibition era and reached its peak during the 1940s and 1950s with the \"Battle of Sunset Strip\" as part of the American Mafia, but has gradually declined since then with the rise of various black and Hispanic gangs in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\nAccording to the Los Angeles Police Department, the city is home to 45,000 gang members, organized into 450 gangs. Among them are the Crips and Bloods, which are both African American street gangs that originated in the South Los Angeles region. Latino street gangs such as the Sure\u00f1os, a Mexican American street gang, and Mara Salvatrucha, which has mainly members of Salvadoran descent, as well as other Central American descents, all originated in Los Angeles. This has led to the city being referred to as the \"Gang Capital of America\".\n\nEducation\nColleges and universities\nThere are three public universities within the city limits: California State University, Los Angeles (CSULA), California State University, Northridge (CSUN) and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).\nPrivate colleges in the city include:\n\nThe community college system consists of nine campuses governed by the trustees of the Los Angeles Community College District:\n\nThere are numerous additional colleges and universities outside the city limits in the Greater Los Angeles area, including the Claremont Colleges consortium, which includes the most selective liberal arts colleges in the U.S., and the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), one of the top STEM-focused research institutions in the world.\n\nSchools\nLos Angeles Unified School District serves almost all of the city of Los Angeles, as well as several surrounding communities, with a student population around 800,000. After Proposition 13 was approved in 1978, urban school districts had considerable trouble with funding. LAUSD has become known for its underfunded, overcrowded and poorly maintained campuses, although its 162 Magnet schools help compete with local private schools.\nSeveral small sections of Los Angeles are in the Inglewood Unified School District, and the Las Virgenes Unified School District. The Los Angeles County Office of Education operates the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts.\n\nMedia\nThe Los Angeles metro area is the second-largest broadcast designated market area in the U.S. (after New York) with 5,431,140 homes (4.956% of the U.S.), which is served by a wide variety of local AM and FM radio and television stations. Los Angeles and New York City are the only two media markets to have seven VHF allocations assigned to them.\nThe major daily English-language newspaper in the area is the Los Angeles Times. La Opini\u00f3n is the city's major daily Spanish-language paper. The Korea Times is the city's major daily Korean-language paper while The World Journal is the city and county's major Chinese newspaper. The Los Angeles Sentinel is the city's major African-American weekly paper, boasting the largest African-American readership in the Western United States. Investor's Business Daily is distributed from its LA corporate offices, which are headquartered in Playa del Rey.\n\nAs part of the region's aforementioned creative industry, the Big Five major broadcast television networks, ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC, and The CW, all have production facilities and offices throughout various areas of Los Angeles. All four major broadcast television networks, plus major Spanish-language networks Telemundo and Univision, also own and operate stations that both serve the Los Angeles market and serve as each network's West Coast flagship station: ABC's KABC-TV (Channel 7), CBS's KCBS-TV (Channel 2), Fox's KTTV-TV (Channel 11), NBC's KNBC-TV (Channel 4), The CW's KTLA-TV (Channel 5), MyNetworkTV's KCOP-TV (Channel 13), Telemundo's KVEA-TV (Channel 52), and Univision's KMEX-TV (Channel 34). The region also has four PBS member stations, with KCET, re-joining the network as secondary affiliate in August 2019, after spending the previous eight years as the nation's largest independent public television station. KTBN (Channel 40) is the flagship station of the religious Trinity Broadcasting Network, based out of Santa Ana. A variety of independent television stations, such as KCAL-TV (Channel 9), also operate in the area.\n\nThere are also a number of smaller regional newspapers, alternative weeklies and magazines, including the Los Angeles Register, Los Angeles Community News, (which focuses on coverage of the greater Los Angeles area), Los Angeles Daily News (which focuses coverage on the San Fernando Valley), LA Weekly, L.A. Record (which focuses coverage on the music scene in the Greater Los Angeles Area), Los Angeles Magazine, the Los Angeles Business Journal, the Los Angeles Daily Journal (legal industry paper), The Hollywood Reporter, Variety (both entertainment industry papers), and Los Angeles Downtown News. In addition to the major papers, numerous local periodicals serve immigrant communities in their native languages, including Armenian, English, Korean, Persian, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Hebrew, and Arabic. Many cities adjacent to Los Angeles also have their own daily newspapers whose coverage and availability overlaps with certain Los Angeles neighborhoods. Examples include The Daily Breeze (serving the South Bay), and The Long Beach Press-Telegram.\nLos Angeles arts, culture and nightlife news is also covered by a number of local and national online guides, including Time Out Los Angeles, Thrillist, Kristin's List, DailyCandy, Diversity News Magazine, LAist, and Flavorpill.\n\nInfrastructure\nTransportation\nFreeways\nThe city and the rest of the Los Angeles metropolitan area are served by an extensive network of freeways and highways. Texas Transportation Institute's annual Urban Mobility Report ranked Los Angeles area roads the most congested in the United States in 2019 as measured by annual delay per traveler, area residents experiencing a cumulative average of 119 hours waiting in traffic that year. Los Angeles was followed by San Francisco\/Oakland, Washington, D.C., and Miami. Despite the congestion in the city, the mean daily travel time for commuters in Los Angeles is shorter than other major cities, including New York City, Philadelphia and Chicago. Los Angeles's mean travel time for work commutes in 2006 was 29.2 minutes, similar to those of San Francisco and Washington, D.C.\nThe major highways that connect LA to the rest of the nation include Interstate 5, which runs south through San Diego to Tijuana in Mexico and north through Sacramento, Portland, and Seattle to the Canada\u2013US border; Interstate 10, the southernmost east\u2013west, coast-to-coast Interstate Highway in the United States, going to Jacksonville, Florida; and U.S. Route 101, which heads to the California Central Coast, San Francisco, the Redwood Empire, and the Oregon and Washington coasts.\n\nBuses\nThe Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA; branded as Metro) and other regional agencies provide a comprehensive bus system that covers Los Angeles County. While the Los Angeles Department of Transportation is responsible for contracting local and commuter bus services primarily within the city limits of Los Angeles and several immediate neighboring municipalities in southwest Los Angeles County, the largest bus system in the city is operated by Metro. Called Los Angeles Metro Bus, the system consists of 117 routes (excluding Metro Busway) throughout Los Angeles and neighboring cities primarily in southwestern Los Angeles County, with most routes following along a particular street in the city's street grid and run to or through Downtown Los Angeles. As of the third quarter of 2023, the system had an average ridership of approximately 692,500 per weekday, with a total of 197,950,700 riders in 2022. Metro also runs two Metro Busway lines, the G and J lines, which are bus rapid transit lines with stops and frequencies similar to those of Los Angeles's light rail system.\nThere are also smaller regional public transit systems that mainly serve specific cities or regions in Los Angeles County. For example, the Big Blue Bus provides extensive bus service in Santa Monica and western Los Angeles County, while Foothill Transit focuses on routes in the San Gabriel Valley in southeast Los Angeles County with one express route going into downtown Los Angeles. Los Angeles World Airports also runs two frequent FlyAway express bus routes (via freeways) from Los Angeles Union Station and Van Nuys to Los Angeles International Airport.\nWhile cash is accepted on all buses, the primary payment method for Los Angeles Metro Bus, Metro Busway, and 27 other regional bus agencies is a TAP card, a contactless stored-value card. According to the 2016 American Community Survey, 9.2% of working Los Angeles (city) residents made the journey to work via public transportation.\n\nRail\nThe Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority also operate a subway and light rail system across Los Angeles and its county. The system is called Los Angeles Metro Rail and consists of the B and D subway lines, as well as the A, C, E, and K light rail lines. TAP cards are required for all Metro Rail trips. As of the third quarter of 2023, the city's subway system is the ninth busiest in the United States, and its light rail system is the country's second busiest. In 2022, the system had a ridership of 57,299,800, or about 189,200 per weekday, in the third quarter of 2023.\nSince the opening of the first line, the A Line, in 1990, the system has been extended significantly, with more extensions currently in progress. Today, the system serves numerous areas across the county on 107.4 mi (172.8 km) of rail, including Long Beach, Pasadena, Santa Monica, Norwalk, El Segundo, North Hollywood, Inglewood, and Downtown Los Angeles. As of 2023, there are 101 stations in the Metro Rail system.\n\nLos Angeles is also center of its county's commuter rail system, Metrolink, which links Los Angeles to Ventura, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and San Diego Counties. The system consists of eight lines and 69 stations operating on 545.6 miles (878.1 kilometres) of track. Metrolink averages 42,600 trips per weekday, the busiest line being the San Bernardino Line. Apart from Metrolink, Los Angeles is also connected to other cities by intercity passenger trains from Amtrak on five different lines. One of the lines is the Pacific Surfliner route which operates multiple daily round trips between San Diego and San Luis Obispo, California through Union Station. It is Amtrak's busiest line outside the Northeast Corridor.The main rail station in the city is Union Station which opened in 1939, and it is the largest passenger rail terminal in the Western United States. The station is a major regional train station for Amtrak, Metrolink and Metro Rail. The station is Amtrak's fifth busiest station, having 1.4 million Amtrak boardings and de-boardings in 2019. Union Station also offers access to Metro Bus, Greyhound, LAX FlyAway, and other buses from different agencies.\n\nAirports\nThe main international and domestic airport serving Los Angeles is Los Angeles International Airport (IATA: LAX, ICAO: KLAX), commonly referred to by its airport code, LAX. It is located on the Westside of Los Angeles near the Sofi Stadium in Inglewood.\nOther major nearby commercial airports include:\n\n(IATA: ONT, ICAO: KONT) Ontario International Airport, owned by the city of Ontario, CA; serves the Inland Empire.\n(IATA: BUR, ICAO: KBUR) Hollywood Burbank Airport, jointly owned by the cities of Burbank, Glendale, and Pasadena. Formerly known as Bob Hope Airport and Burbank Airport, the closest airport to Downtown Los Angeles serves the San Fernando, San Gabriel, and Antelope Valleys.\n(IATA: LGB, ICAO: KLGB) Long Beach Airport, serves the Long Beach\/Harbor area.\n(IATA: SNA, ICAO: KSNA) John Wayne Airport of Orange County.\nOne of the world's busiest general-aviation airports is also in Los Angeles: Van Nuys Airport (IATA: VNY, ICAO: KVNY).\n\nSeaports\nThe Port of Los Angeles is in San Pedro Bay in the San Pedro neighborhood, approximately 20 miles (32 km) south of Downtown. Also called Los Angeles Harbor and WORLDPORT LA, the port complex occupies 7,500 acres (30 km2) of land and water along 43 miles (69 km) of waterfront. It adjoins the separate Port of Long Beach.\nThe sea ports of the Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach together make up the Los Angeles\/Long Beach Harbor. Together, both ports are the fifth busiest container port in the world, with a trade volume of over 14.2 million TEU's in 2008. Singly, the Port of Los Angeles is the busiest container port in the United States and the largest cruise ship center on the West Coast of the United States \u2013 The Port of Los Angeles's World Cruise Center served about 590,000 passengers in 2014.\nThere are also smaller, non-industrial harbors along Los Angeles's coastline. The port includes four bridges: the Vincent Thomas Bridge, Henry Ford Bridge, Long Beach International Gateway Bridge, and Commodore Schuyler F. Heim Bridge. Passenger ferry service from San Pedro to the city of Avalon (and Two Harbors) on Santa Catalina Island is provided by Catalina Express.\n\nNotable people\nSister cities\nLos Angeles has 25 sister cities, listed chronologically by year joined:\n\nIn addition, Los Angeles has the following \"friendship cities\":\n\n \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Poland\n City of Melbourne, Australia\n Manchester, United Kingdom\n Tel Aviv, Israel\n\nSee also\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\nGeneral\nAbu-Lughod, Janet L.

The basin is also connected to an anomalous group of east-west trending chains of mountains collectively known as the Transverse Ranges. The present basin is a coastal lowland area, whose floor is marked by elongate low ridges and groups of hills that is located on the edge of the Pacific Plate. The Los Angeles Basin, along with the Santa Barbara Channel, the Ventura Basin, the San Fernando Valley, and the San Gabriel Basin, lies within the greater Southern California region. The majority of the jurisdictional land area of the city of Los Angeles physically lies within this basin.\nOn the north, northeast, and east, the lowland basin is bound by the Santa Monica Mountains and Puente, Elysian, and Repetto hills. To the southeast, the basin is bordered by the Santa Ana Mountains and the San Joaquin Hills. The western boundary of the basin is marked by the Continental Borderland and is part of the onshore portion. The California borderland is characterized by northwest trending offshore ridges and basins. The Los Angeles Basin is notable for its great structural relief and complexity in relation to its geologic youth and small size for its prolific oil production. Yerkes et al. identify five major stages of the basin's evolution, which began in the Upper Cretaceous and ended in the Pleistocene. This basin can be classified as an irregular pull-apart basin accompanied by rotational tectonics during the post-early Miocene.\n\nFormation\nBefore the formation of the basin, the area that encompasses the Los Angeles basin began above ground. A rapid transgression and regression of the shoreline moved the area to a shallow marine environment. Tectonic instability coupled with volcanic activity in rapidly subsiding areas during the Middle Miocene set the stage for the modern basin. The basin formed in a submarine environment and was later brought back above sea level when the rate of subsidence slowed. There is much discussion in the literature about the geologic time boundaries when each basin forming event took place. While exact ages may not be clear, Yerkes et al. (1965) provided a general timeline to categorize the sequence of depositional events in the LA Basin's evolution and they are as follows:\n\nPhase 1: Pre-extension\nDuring pre-Turonian, metamorphosed sedimentary and volcanic rocks are present that serve as the two major basement rock units for the LA Basin. Large-scale movement along the Newport\u2013Inglewood zone juxtaposed the two bedrock units along the east and west margins. During this phase, the basin was above sea level.\n\nPhase 2: Pre-basin phase of deposition\nThe hallmarks of this phase were successive shoreline transgression and regression cycles. Deposition of older marine and non-marine sediments began to fill the basin. Towards the end of this phase, the shoreline began to retreat and deposition continued.\n\nPhase 3: Basin inception\nAfter the deposition of the pre-Turonian units, there was a large emergence and erosion that can be observed as a major unconformity at the base of the middle Miocene units. Emergence did not occur at the same rate or in all sections of the basin. During this time, the basin was covered by a marine embayment. Rivers sourced in the highlands brought large amounts of detritus to the northeastern edge of the basin. During this period, the Topanga formation was also being deposited.\n\nPhase 4: Principal phase of subsidence and deposition\nThe present form and structural relief of the basin was largely established during this phase of accelerated subsidence and deposition which occurred during the late Miocene and continued through the early Pleistocene. Clastic sedimentary rocks from the highland areas (to the north and east) moved down the submarine slopes and infilled the basin floor. Subsidence and sedimentation most likely began in the southern portion basin. Subsidence and Deposition occurred simultaneously, without interruption,  until the late Pliocene. Until the rate of deposition gradually overtook the rate of subsidence, and the sea level began to fall. Towards the end of this phase, the margins of the basin began to rise above sea level. During the early Pleistocene, deposition began to outpace subsidence in the depressed parts of the basin and the shoreline began to move southward. This phase also had movement along the Newport\u2013Inglewood fault zone that resulted in the initiation of the modern basin. This movement caused the southwestern block to be uplifted relative to the central basin block.\n\nPhase 5: Basin disruption\nThe central part of the basin continued to experience sediment deposition through the Pleistocene from flooding and erosional debris from the surrounding mountains and Puente Hills. This infill was responsible for the final retreat of the shoreline from the basin. Deposition in the Holocene is characterized by non marine gravel, sand and silt. This phase also includes the late stage compressional deformation responsible for the formation of the hydrocarbon traps.\n\nGeology\nBlocks\nFour major faults are present in the region and divide the basin in the central, northwest, southwest, and northeast structural blocks. These blocks not only denote their geographic location, but they indicate the strata present and major structural features. The southwestern block was uplifted prior to the middle Miocene and is composed mostly of marine strata and contains two major anticlines. This block also contains the steeply-dipping Palos Verdes Hills fault zone. The middle Miocene volcanics can be seen locally within the southwest block. The northwestern block consists of clastic marine sediments of Late Cretaceous to Pleistocene age. Middle Miocene volcanics are also present. This block has a broad anticline that is truncated by the Santa Monica fault zone. The central block contains both marine and non-marine clastic rock units interbedded with volcanic rocks that are late Cretaceous to Pliocene in age. Pliocene and Quaternary strata are most visible within the central block. Structurally, there is a synclinal trough. The northeastern block contains fine to coarse grained clastic marine rocks of Cenozoic age. Locally, middle Miocene volcanics can be seen as well as Eocene to Miocene aged non-marine sedimentary rocks. There is also an anticline in the northeastern block.\n\nStratigraphy\nHomogeneous evolution of this basin did not occur due to dynamic tectonic activity. Despite the active setting, there are over 9,100 m of strata within the basin. The dynamic setting was also responsible for the heterogeneous deposition of each formation. It is common for rock units of the same depositional event to have different names in different locations within the basin. This may be a result of large variation in clast size as with the upper Pliocene Pico Formation in the northwestern part of the basin and the Upper Fernando Formation in the southwest part of the basin. \nThe Los Angeles Basin contains what is known as the \"Great Unconformity\" which has been interpreted as a large scale erosional event in the basement rock unit. This unconformity is used to correlate strata throughout the basin. The record of the Cenozoic activity begins above this unconformity. The stratigraphic record for this basin indicates that it began as a non-marine environment and then transgressed to a deep ocean system. The oldest basement units of this basin are of both sedimentary and igneous origin. The sedimentary unit was metamorphosed as a result of slippage of the Newport\u2013Inglewood fault and is known as the Catalina Schist. The Catalina Schist can be found on the southwestern edge of the basin and is predominantly a chlorite-quartz schist. Closer to the Newport\u2013Inglewood fault zone, garnet-bearing schists and metagabbros occur. The Santa Monica Slate can be observed in the northwestern block of the basin. The eastern complex is characterized by Santiago Peak Volcanics. This rock unit contains andesitic breccias, flow, agglomerates and tuffs.\nThe Sespe Formation is the first to appear above the great unconformity and is marked by interbedded mudstones, sandstones and pebbly sandstones. This bed sequence indicates an alluvial fan, meandering stream or braided stream origin. Upward from the Sespe Formation toward the Vaqueros, the grains become finer and the beds become thinner; indicating a transition to a shallow marine environment. The Vaqueros Formation is marked by two sandstone, siltstone and shale units. There are also characteristic mollusk fossils that indicate the area was dominately shallow marine.\nThe Topanga Group is the next major formation in the stratigraphic sequence and infills the topography on older rocks. It is a mixed sedimentary and volcanic unit whose base is an erosional unconformity. The unit consists of 3 parts: First is a basal marine conglomeratic sandstone, followed by a dominantly basaltic middle layer of multiple submarine lava flows and tuffs. The youngest part of this unit is a sedimentary breccia, conglomerate, sandstone, and a siltstone. The earliest deposits of the Topanga Group appear to reflect the continuation of a shift in shoreline that can be seen in both the Sespe and Vaqueros formations. Eruptions from one or more of volcanic centers locally and temporarily interrupted sedimentation.\nThe Puente Formation is a deep-marine formation that is characterized by pro-delta sediments and an overlapping fan system. This unit lies above the Topanga Group giving it a Late Miocene depositional age and is divided into four members. The La Vida Member is a micaceous, platy siltstone with subordinate amounts of thin-bedded feldspathic sandstone. The next member is the Soquel, which is a thick bedded to massive micaceous sandstone. Locally abundant siltstone, conglomerate, and intraformational breccia can also be seen in this member. Above the Soquel lies the Yorba Member. This member is a sandy siltstone that is interbedded with a fine-grained sandstone. The Sycamore Canyon Member contains lenses of conglomerate, conglomeratic sandstone, and sandstone. Sandy siltstone and fine-grained sandstones are interbedded with the aforementioned rock types.\nThe Monterey Formation is characterized by abnormally high silica content compared to most clastic rocks. There are also silica-cemented rocks known as porcelanite and porcelanite shale. While this formation has distinguishable beds, there are many shale, sandstone, and mudstone beds that have normal amounts of silica. This sequence of this formation indicates an off-shore marine environment.\nThe Fernando Formation is split into two sub-facies known as the Pico and Repetto Members. These members represent a distinct change in the depositional environment and are of Pleistocene age. The Repetto is the older of the two members and is composed of interbedded fine to coarse grained siltstone, mudstone, and sandstone. The Pico Member is mostly made of massive siltstones and sandstones interbedded with minor silty-sandstones. Holocene alluvium and Quaternary sediments is a largely unconsolidated unit and is composed mostly of gravel and floodplain sediments. The sediments that mark the top of the basin can be found in modern streams\/rivers and at the base of the foothills.\n\nTectonic setting\nThe history of this basin begins with the subduction of Pacific plate underneath the North American plate in the beginning of the Mesozoic. During this subduction event, two smaller plates, the Monterey and Juan de Fuca plates, also began to subduct underneath the North American plate. Around 20Ma, the Monterey plate attached to and followed the motion of the Pacific plate. Later, subduction of the Pacific-Monterey ceased and the plate margin was converted to a transform boundary. The North America\/Pacific-Monterey transform boundary began to move north and created crustal extension. This rifting was accompanied with the rotation of the western Transverse Ranges. This rotation is responsible for the placement and northwest-southeast orientation of the LA Basin. Early in the Miocene, before deposition of the Topanga, high heat flow and transtension caused the extension of the basin. As the crust thinned, the basin began to subside  from isostatic pressure as a result of large amounts of sediment deposition.\nBecause the basin lies on the boundary of the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges, this basin experiences both compressional and strike slip tectonics. During the early Pliocene, also identified as the \"Basin Disruption\" phase, deformation and folding occurred as a result of fault movement and a slight rotation event. While movement along the San Andreas Fault is responsible for the placement of the basin, it is the Whittier and Newport\u2013Inglewood faults that have dictated the seismic behavior within the basin.\n\nEarthquakes\nThe Los Angeles basin is still active tectonically and the region continues to experience earthquakes as a result. Due to the number of faults and fault splays, seismic activity is not concentrated in one particular area. The cities that are overlain by the Newport\u2013Inglewood and Whittier fault zones have a higher probability of experiencing seismic activity. The region experiences earthquakes that are mostly mild (magnitude \u22642.25). However moderate earthquakes (magnitude 4.9 to 6.4) have been reported. Earthquakes of moderate magnitude are very infrequent.\n\nFeatures\nThe Newport\u2013Inglewood Fault Zone\nThis fault zone is the most notable feature within the basin that is a single strand with local (fault) splays. The fault zone is also marked by low hills, scarps, and ten anticlinal folds in a right-stepping en echelon pattern. It is located in the southwest portion of the basin and is a strike-slip margin. There are several oil fields that run parallel to this fault.\n\nThe Whittier Fault\nThis fault lies on the eastern border of the basin and mergers with the Elsinore Fault in the canyon of the Santa Ana river, one of the upper branches of the fault. This fault is a reverse right-oblique fault. It is most known for the Whittier, Brea-Olinda, Sansinena, oil fields. There is an anticline that runs parallel to the Whittier fault that is evidence for compressional deformation during the late Miocene to early Pliocene. Thinning and pinch-out of the Pliocene sandstones are evidence for uplift during this same time period.\n\nThe Anaheim Nose\nThe Anaheim nose is a subsurface feature that was discovered by geophysical surveys and exploratory drilling in 1930. It is a mid-Miocene fault block that revealed a northwest trending ridge of Paleocene age rocks. This structural feature is important because it revealed many oil traps and orientation of the beds indicate the age of subsidence in this portion of the basin.\n\nThe Wilmington Anticline\nThis particular anticline is the most notable subsurface feature within the basin. Deformation events such as erosion of the uplifted crustal blocks, initiation of various faults, and the development of the submarine channel led to the anticline's formation. Fold initiation began in the late-Miocene to early Pliocene period of deformation. There are many other anticlines within the basin and isopach data suggests that the formation of these folds occurred mostly during the Pliocene.\n\nThe La Brea Tar Pits\nThe La Brea Tar Pits are pools of stagnant asphaltum that have been found on the basin's surface. These \"pools\" are important because hundreds of thousands of late Pleistocene bones and plants have been found. These pits allowed scientists to better understand the ecosystem at that particular point in the geologic past.\n\nPetroleum\nAccumulations of oil and gas occur almost wholly within strata of the younger sequence and in areas that are within or adjacent to the coastal belt. The Puente formation has proved to be the most notable reservoir for petroleum in the basin. The primary reason for the high abundance of oil is because the oil sands are well saturated within the basin. The thickness of these oil sands range from hundreds to thousands of feet. Anticlines and faulted anticlines are the structural features that are also responsible for trapping oil.\nThe first reported oil-producing well was discovered in 1892 on the land that is presently beneath Dodger Stadium. This basin  was responsible for half of the states oil production until the (90's?). This is remarkable due to the relatively small size and youth of the basin. The basin currently has about 40 active oil fields that collectively have 4,000 operating wells. In 1904, there were over 1,150 wells in the city of Los Angeles alone. Tight spacing and continued pumping of the wells resulted in most of the wells to dry up. Most recent data indicates that 255 million barrels of oil were produced in 2013. This is a large decline from the almost 1 billion barrels per year produced in the late 1970s.\nOil fields include:\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nSignificant LA earthquakes","136":"The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA), branded as Metro, is the county agency that plans, operates, and coordinates funding for most of the public transportation system in Los Angeles County, California, the most populated county in the United States. \nThe agency directly operates a large transit system that includes bus, light rail, heavy rail (subway), and bus rapid transit services. Metro also provides funding for transit it does not operate, including Metrolink commuter rail, municipal bus operators and paratransit services. The agency also provides funding and directs planning for railroad and highway projects within Los Angeles County.\nIn 2023, the Metro system had a total ridership of 284,901,000, and had a ridership of 962,500 per weekday as of the second quarter of 2024. It is the largest transit agency by ridership in the state of California, and the third-largest in the United States.\n\nBackground\nThe Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority was formed on February 1, 1993, by the California State Legislature which merged two rival agencies: the Southern California Rapid Transit District (SCRTD or more often, RTD) and the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission (LACTC).\nThe RTD was founded on August 18, 1964, to operate most public transportation in the urbanized Southern California region, including Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Orange, and Riverside counties. RTD replaced the major predecessor public agency, the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Authority, and took over eleven failing other bus companies and services in the Southern California region. Services outside of Los Angeles County began to be divested in the early 1980s.\nThe LACTC began operation in 1977 after a state requirement that all counties form local transportation commissions. Its main objective was to be the guardian of all transportation funding, both transit and highway, for Los Angeles County.\nThe bickering between the two agencies came to a head in the 1980s. At that time, the LACTC was building the Blue Line (now A Line) light rail line between Los Angeles and Long Beach, while the RTD was building the Red Line (now B Line) subway in Downtown Los Angeles. It was revealed that due to disputes between the agencies, the LACTC was planning to end the Blue Line at Pico Station, instead of serving the 7th Street\/Metro Center station being built by the RTD six blocks north.\nLA Metro has assumed the functions of both agencies and now develops and oversees transportation plans, policies, funding programs, and both short-term and long-range solutions to mobility, accessibility and environmental needs in the county. The agency is also the primary public transit provider for the city of Los Angeles, the second largest city in the United States, providing the bulk of such services. even though the city's own Los Angeles Department of Transportation LADOT operates a smaller bus only public transit system of its own called DASH within the MTA service area in the city of Los Angeles, often overlapping with some Metro Bus routes and stops in several neighborhoods primarily in the central part of the city.\nSince 1995 the agency has been based out of the Metro Headquarters Building, a 26-story high-rise office tower located next to Union Station, a major transportation hub and the main train station for the Los Angeles metropolitan area, which it has also owned since purchasing it in 2011.\nThe Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority operates the third-largest public transportation system in the United States by ridership with a 1,433 mi2 (3,711 km2) operating area and 2,000 peak hour buses on the street any given business day. Metro also operates 109 miles (175 km) of urban rail service. The authority has 10,290 employees, making it one of the region's largest employers.\nThe authority also partially funds sixteen municipal bus operators and an array of transportation projects including bikeways and pedestrian facilities, local roads and highway improvements, goods movement, Metrolink regional commuter rail, Freeway Service Patrol and freeway call boxes within the County of Los Angeles.\nTo increase sustainability in transportation services, Metro also provides bike and pedestrian improvements for the over 10.1 million residents of Los Angeles County.\nSecurity and law enforcement services on Metro property (including buses and trains) are currently provided by the Transit Services Bureau via contract, in conjunction with Metro Transit Enforcement Department, Los Angeles Police Department (Union Station and all LACMTA rail services within the City of Los Angeles) in the City of Long Beach, the Long Beach Police Department and in the City of Santa Monica, California the Santa Monica Police Department.\n\nServices\nInteractive Metro Rail and Busway map\n\nMetro Rail\nMetro Rail is a rail mass transit system with two subway and four light rail lines. As of June 2023, the system runs a total of 109 miles (175 km), with 101 stations.\n\n A Line is a light rail line running between Azusa and Long Beach via Downtown Los Angeles.\n B Line is a subway line running between North Hollywood and Downtown Los Angeles.\n C Line is a light rail line running between Redondo Beach and Norwalk, largely in the median of the 105 freeway. It provides indirect access to Los Angeles International Airport via a shuttle bus.\n D Line is a subway line running between the Mid-Wilshire district and Downtown Los Angeles. Most of its route is shared with the B Line. The line is currently being extended westward.\n E Line is a light rail line running between Santa Monica and East Los Angeles via Downtown Los Angeles.\n K Line is a light rail line running between South Los Angeles and Inglewood, with a connection and route change to the C Line opening in 2024 and the LAX Automated People Mover opening in October 2025.\n\nMetro Bus\nMetro is the primary bus operator in the Los Angeles Basin, the San Fernando Valley, and the western San Gabriel Valley. Other regions of Los Angeles County, including the Antelope Valley and the eastern San Gabriel Valley, are served by separate bus operators, which receive some funding from Metro.\nAs of June 2023, the Metro Bus system includes 117 routes, serving over 11,000 bus stops. Most Metro Bus lines are local services, stopping at marked stops approximately every two blocks. Limited-stop Metro Rapid services stop only at major intersections, and Metro Express services utilize the extensive Southern California freeways to provide nonstop service between regional destinations.\n\nMetro Busway\nMetro Busway is a bus rapid transit system with two lines operating on dedicated or shared-use busways. The system runs a total of 55.7 miles (89.6 km), with 29 stations and over 42,000 daily weekday boardings as of May 2016.\nThe Metro Busway system is meant to mimic the Metro Rail system, both in the vehicle's design and in the operation of the line. Vehicles stop at dedicated stations (except for the portion of the Metro J Line in Downtown Los Angeles), vehicles receive priority at intersections and are painted in a silver livery similar to Metro Rail vehicles.\n\n G Line is a bus rapid transit line running between Chatsworth and North Hollywood.\n J Line is a bus rapid transit line running between El Monte, Downtown Los Angeles, and Harbor Gateway, with some trips continuing to San Pedro.\n\nBusways\nThe Metro Busway J Line operates over two busways, semi-exclusive roadways built into the Southern California freeway system. These busways are also used by other bus routes to speed up their trips.\n\nThe El Monte Busway is a combination busway and high-occupancy toll (HOT) roadway that runs in the median of the San Bernardino Freeway (I-10) and on a separate right-of-way. The busway provides express bus service between Downtown LA and the San Gabriel Valley. Services on the busway are operated by both Metro and Foothill Transit.\nThe Harbor Transitway is a combination busway and HOT roadway that runs in the median of the Harbor Freeway (I-110). The busway provides express bus service between San Pedro and Downtown LA. Services on the busway are operated by Metro, GTrans, LADOT, OC Bus and Torrance Transit.\n\nOther services\nMetro Bike Share: A bicycle-sharing system in Downtown LA, Central LA, Hollywood, North Hollywood and on the Westside.\nMetro ExpressLanes: High-occupancy toll lanes on the El Monte Busway and Harbor Transitway.\nMetro Freeway Service Patrol: A joint effort between Metro, Caltrans, and the California Highway Patrol offering free quick-fix repairs and towing from freeways.\nMetro Micro: An on-demand transit service, operated using vans in 8 zones around the region\nBike paths: 475 miles (764 km) of bike facilities for commuter and recreational purposes.\nHOV (Carpool) Lanes: 219 miles (352 km), 423 miles (681 km) both directions\/each lane, of carpool, vanpool, and express bus lanes.\nMetrolink: Partially funded by Metro, it is Southern California's regional commuter rail system.\nPacific Surfliner: Partially funded by Metro. Metro has two board seats in the LOSSAN Rail Corridor Agency\n\nFares and fare collection\nThe base fare for Metro services, including local and express buses and Metro Rail, is $1.75. Metro introduced daily and weekly fare caps in July 2023, replacing daily, weekly, and monthly passes. With fare capping, the cost of each trip is credited towards the cost of a daily or weekly unlimited pass, automatically ensuring that all passengers pay the lowest fare possible. Discounted or free fares are available for seniors, disabled individuals, Medicare recipients, low-income individuals, and students.\nThe primary method of payment for Metro fares is the TAP card, a contactless stored-value card. TAP cards are valid on Metro buses and trains, and on 25 other transit agencies in Los Angeles County. TAP cards are required for Metro Rail trips, free bus transfers, and fare capping; however, single-ride bus fares can still be paid in cash. TAP cards can be purchased at station fare machines, local vendors, online, and at Metro Customer Care Centers.\nFare gates are installed at all B, C, D and K Line stations, along with select A and E Line stations. Fare gates were added after 2007 to reduce fare evasion. At the time, the decision was criticized for its cost and perceived ineffectiveness.\n\nRidership\nThe Metro B Line has the highest ridership of all Metro Rail lines and also the lowest operational cost because of its high ridership. The Metro Busway Metro J Line has the lowest ridership of all color-branded lines. Average daily boardings and passenger miles for all of 2018 are as follows:\n\nGovernance\nDay-to-day operations of Metro is overseen by Chief Executive Officer Stephanie Wiggins. Metro is a joint powers authority governed by a board of directors with 14 members, 13 of whom are voting members. The Board is composed of:\n\nThe five members of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors\nThe mayor of the city of Los Angeles\nThree people appointed by the mayor of Los Angeles, at least one of whom must be member of the Los Angeles City Council.\nFour city council members or mayors from LA County cities other than Los Angeles, who each represent one region of the county: San Gabriel\/Pomona Valley, Arroyo\/Verdugo, Gateway Cities and Westside Cities\nOne non-voting member appointed by the Governor of California (traditionally the Director of Caltrans District 7)\nWhile the Metro board makes decisions on large issues, they rely on Service Councils to advise on smaller decisions, such as on bus stop placement and over bus service changes. To enable this work, the councils call and conduct public hearings, evaluate Metro programs in their area, and meet with management staff. There are five Service Councils, each representing a different region: Gateway Cities, San Fernando Valley, San Gabriel Valley, South Bay, and Westside\/Central. Each council is led by a board composed of a political appointees.\nMembers of Metro staff also sit on the boards of other joint powers authorities across the region, including the LOSSAN Rail Corridor Agency, the Alameda Corridor Transportation Authority, the Foothill Gold Line Construction Authority, the Southern California Regional Rail Authority, the High Desert Corridor Joint Powers Agency, and the Inglewood Transit Connector Joint Powers Authority.\n\nBoard of Directors\nChair\n\nJanice Hahn, Los Angeles County Board Supervisor, District 4\nVice Chair\n\nFernando Dutra, Appointee of Los Angeles County City Selection Committee, Southeast Long Beach sector, City of Whittier, District 4\n2nd Vice Chair  \n\nJacquelyn Dupont-Walker, Appointee of the Mayor of the City of Los Angeles\nExecutive Board Members\n\nKathryn Barger, Los Angeles County Board Supervisor, District 5\nJames T.

Below is the funding breakdown from Metro's fiscal year 2020 budget:\n\nJurisdiction\nThe agency is a public transportation and planning agency that lies under the jurisdiction of the State of California. Although it falls under State regulations, it can also partake in regional and municipal levels of rule during a transportation development project. For example, it can play a role in policies regarding a state's housing policies, since the living situation of one affects the methods of transportation its residents will take.\nThis transit agency can measure successful projects through key pointers such as low income ridership increase and an increase of favorable environmental and health factors for its public community. Increased low income ridership is a significant factor because that focus group tends to makes up the majority of public transit ridership. Favorable environmental and health factors are also relevant factors because they indicate a positive relationship within the space developed and its residents.\n\nFleet\nMost of Metro's bus fleet is powered by compressed natural gas (CNG), the largest such fleet in the United States. Using CNG reduces emissions of particulates by 90%, carbon monoxide by 80%, and greenhouse gases by 20% compared to diesel powered buses. The agency is also operating a substantial number of battery electric buses, notably on the G Line busway which has seen all CNG buses replaced with battery electric ones, and has plans to convert into a fully electric bus system. Buses feature on-board visual displays and automatic voice announcement systems that announce the next stop.\nThe Metro Rail fleet is broken down into two main types: light rail vehicles and rapid transit cars (commonly called subway cars in Los Angeles). Metro's light rail vehicles, used on the A, C, E, and K Lines, are 87-foot (26.52 m) articulated, high-floor double-ended cars, powered by overhead catenary lines, which typically run in two or three car consists. Metro's subway cars, used on the B and D Lines, are 75-foot (22.86 m) electric multiple unit, married-pair cars, powered by electrified third rail, that typically run in four or six car consists.\n\nFuture\nNextGen Bus Plan\nMetro is currently implementing its \"NextGen Bus Plan,\" a major restructuring of the agency's routes. The plan eliminates most of the Metro Rapid routes and low-performing Metro Local lines to invest in the remaining routes. Metro says the plan will double the number of frequent bus lines (defined as a bus every 10 minutes or better) and expand midday, evening, and weekend service while ensuring that 99% of current riders continue to have a less than 1\u20444-mile walk to their bus stop.\n\nD Line Extension\nSection 1 of the D Line Extension will add three new subway stations to the D Line at Wilshire\/La Brea, Wilshire\/Fairfax, and Wilshire\/La Cienega. Construction on Section 1 began in 2014 and is expected to be complete in 2025. Section 2 to Century City is expected to be completed in 2026, followed by Section 3 to Westwood in 2027.\n\nFoothill Extension\nMetro is constructing an extension of the A Line to Pomona\u2013North station. The first phase of this extension, to Azusa, opened on March 5, 2016. Groundbreaking for the second phase to Pomona occurred on December 2, 2017, with construction starting in July 2020. The project is expected to be completed in January 2025.\n\nAerial Rapid Transit\nMetro, in partnership with LA Aerial Rapid Transit Technologies LLC, is currently proposing to construct an aerial gondola system to connect Dodger Stadium and the stadium's surrounding communities to Union Station in Downtown Los Angeles. When completed, the approximate 5,000 people per hour, per direction aerial gondola is expected to transport visitors from Union Station to Dodger Stadium in approximately seven minutes. Additionally, the proposed project would also include several improvements to the nearby Los Angeles State Historic Park.\n\nLong-range Measure M plans\nMeasure M, passed in November 2016, extends and increases the Measure R 30-year half-cent sales tax to a permanent one-cent sales tax. This tax is expected to fund $120 billion in highway and transit projects over 40 years. The tax is also expected to support over 778,000 jobs in the Los Angeles area and $79.3 billion in economic output.\nProjects to be funded by Measure M, not previously mentioned above, include:\n\nA streetcar in Downtown Los Angeles\nThe Los Angeles County portion of the High Desert Corridor: a freeway, rail transit, and bikeway corridor linking cities in the Antelope and Victor Valleys.

The school encompasses the Los Angeles Recording School and is accredited by the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges and the California Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education.\n\nHistory\nThe Los Angeles Film School was founded in 1999. The school was conceived and founded by married investors Paul Kessler, a financier, and Diana Derycz-Kessler, a Harvard-trained lawyer and entrepreneur, together with Thom Mount, and venture capitalist Bud MaLette. In 1998, the founders developed the idea for the school and made an initial investment of $2 million.\nThe first classes began in September 1999, and the school's first students graduated in July 2000. The founding faculty included Tom Schatz, professor of film, William A. Fraker and Janusz Kami\u0144ski teaching cinematography, Jon Amiel and Donald Petrie teaching directing, Dede Allen teaching editing, Ron Judkins teaching sound production, and Joe Byron, Director of Technology.\nThe school was originally funded by Kessler and Derycz-Kessler through their company Bristol Investments. After 18 months, the couple bought out their partners in the school and Dercyz-Kessler became the CEO, seeking to address overspending in a more active role. The total investment in the school had grown to $15 million by 2001, including the installation of the professional equipment required for film production. As of 2001, students at the school had created 700 short films. The total number of students was 150 full-time and approximately 30 part-time.\nIn 2003, the school formed a partnership with several private equity investors.  In April 2011, a decision was made by ACCET to withdraw its accreditation of The Los Angeles Recording School. The decision was stayed on appeal, and the school was permitted to resign its accreditation amicably, following the transfer of remaining students to The Los Angeles Film School, which is accredited by the ACCSC.\nIn February 2010, employees of The Los Angeles Film School submitted authorization cards to the National Labor Relations Board in an effort to become unionized as part of the California Federation of Teachers. Following the controversial firing of a Los Angeles Film School employee and union organizer, and the litigation which led to her reinstatement, the group withdrew its petition for unionization. In July 2011, the school settled a dispute with a local farmers market, which regularly blocked access to a Los Angeles Film School parking garage.\nBy 2011, the school's enrollment had grown to 1,800 students.  Derycz-Kessler had a 17-year tenure as CEO (from 2000 to July 2017).  Tammy Elliott is currently the school's president.\n\nFacilities\nThe Los Angeles Film School is located on Sunset Boulevard in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Hollywood, where its quarter-million square foot campus (23,000 m2) includes the historic RCA Building, which is known for being a recording place of artists including Elvis Presley, the Rolling Stones and Henry Mancini. In 2001, the school opened a 345-seat, THX-certified theater featuring a Sony 4K projector. In 2006, the nearby six-story Klasky Csupo studio building (originally built in 1985 for a Mercedes-Benz dealership) was purchased, which brought the total area of the campus to 230,000 square feet (21,000 m2). The campus also includes a 4,000 square feet (370 m2) sound stage and the 8,000 square feet (740 m2) Ivar Theater. The school's main stage houses a 3,000 square feet (280 m2) set of a Victorian house, where students can produce television shows with industry professionals. Overall, as of March 2011, $61 million had been invested in the buildings alone.\n\nAcademics\nThe school is accredited by the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges (ACCSC) and the California Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education (BPPE) to offer associate and bachelor's degrees. In order to maintain its accreditation with the ACCSC, the school must achieve 70% industry job placement for its students within a year of graduation. The school is an Avid Pro Tools curriculum partner.\nThe school is approved to teach veterans by the California State Approving Agency for Veterans Education. It is also a member of the Servicemembers Opportunity College Consortium, and is considered a military friendly school by MilitaryFriendly.com. Military Times magazine ranked The Los Angeles Film School 7th on their \"Best for Vets: Career & Technical Colleges\" list for 2014, and in the top five on 2015's list.\n\nDegree programs\nThe Los Angeles Film School offers several associate and bachelor's degree programs related to the entertainment industry. Film related degrees include an associate degree in film, and bachelor's degrees in digital filmmaking and film production. Degrees related to the video game industry include an associate degree in game production and a bachelor's in game production and design.  The school also offers an associate degree in computer animation and a bachelor's in animation and visual effects. Two associate degrees related to the music industry are offered, one in music production and one in recording arts. In addition, the school offers a bachelor's degree in entertainment business.\n\nFaculty and staff\nSince 2012, former Universal Studios executive and film producer Hal Lieberman has headed a bachelor of science program in entertainment business.\nJoe Byron, who holds eight patents related to motion picture production, has served several roles at the school since 1999, including Director of Education, Director of Technology, and Director of Student and Alumni Engagement.\n\nProductions and events\nThe feature-length film Demon Slayer was produced by the school in 2003 and was financed by Roger Corman. The cast and crew for the film, including director James Cotton, was composed of students and alumni of The Los Angeles Film School. The film was produced through the school's 1st Chance Films program, which partners well-known producers with its students to make films using the facilities at the school. The school's Military Services Department produced the 2011 documentary The Yellow Ribbon Experience, which chronicles the reintegration of soldiers from the 63rd Regional Support Command into civilian life.  \nSince 2007, the school has held an annual panel discussion which features the writers of Oscar-nominated films. In 2010, the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award for Bob Marley was presented to the artist's family at the school. Since 2009, the school has held an annual Veterans Day event called the \"Annual Salute\" to honor students with military service records.\nSince 2012, The Los Angeles Film School has hosted the Evolution International Film Festival. The school also served as host to the 2012 GI Film Festival as part of its Annual Salute, and featured two films produced by Los Angeles Film School students.\nThe school was host to the 2013 Los Angeles Brazilian Film Festival and also hosts the Los Angeles-based 3D Film Festival. The school has also hosted the BAFTA Student Film Awards in 2011.\n\nNotable alumni\nSeveral alumni of The Los Angeles Film School have gone on to have notable careers in the entertainment industry, including David Eischen, of techno band Transoverload, Kyle Newacheck, director and co-creator of the television series Workaholics; Ari Levine, who is a member of the writing and producing team for musician Bruno Mars; Martin Pensa, who was nominated for an Oscar for his work editing the film Dallas Buyers Club; Brandon Trost, who has served as cinematographer on several films including That Awkward Moment and This is the End; Jaycen Joshua, who is a Grammy Award-winning sound mixer; and Brian Taylor, co-writer and co-director of Crank, Crank: High Voltage and Gamer. In 2021 Phillip Bladh became the first alumni to win an Academy Award for best sound for the movie Sound of Metal.\n\nLawsuit\nThe Los Angeles Film School and Los Angeles Recording School faced a class action lawsuit in 2010, due to the school allegedly using deceptive tactics in promising students jobs in the entertainment industry.  The complaint stated that the school allegedly failed to give them their 900 hours of instruction, and would allegedly attempt to bribe students with gift cards to Target and Best Buy if they would sign self-employment forms misrepresenting sales clerk positions at the Apple Store and Guitar Center as \"Creative positions\".\n\nSee also\nList of film schools in the United States\nLos Angeles Recording School\nFor Profit Schools\nCareer Education Corp\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website","139":"The Los Angeles Herald or the Evening Herald was a newspaper published in Los Angeles in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Founded in 1873 by Charles A. Storke, the newspaper was acquired by William Randolph Hearst in 1931. It merged with the Los Angeles Express and became an evening newspaper known as the Los Angeles Herald-Express.  A 1962 combination with Hearst's morning Los Angeles Examiner resulted in its final incarnation as the evening Los Angeles Herald-Examiner.\n\nHistory\nEstablished in 1873, the Los Angeles Herald represented the largely Democratic views of the city and focused primarily on issues local to Los Angeles and Southern California. Appealing to a mostly working-class audience during its 116 years of publication, the Herald evolved from a primary focus on agriculture to reporting extensively on Hollywood gossip and local scandal, reflecting the transformation of Los Angeles itself during the twentieth century.\nThe Los Angeles Daily Herald was first published on October 2,   1873, by Charles A. Storke. It was the first newspaper in Southern California to use the innovative steam press; the newspaper's offices at 125 South Broadway were popular with the public because large windows on the ground floor allowed passersby to see the presses in motion.\nStorke lost the paper to creditors, who together formed the Los Angeles City and County Publishing Company in 1874. The Herald continued to focus on local news, including agriculture, business, and culture.\nUnder the leadership of Robert M. Widney, the paper dramatically increased its circulation. Widney interviewed local farmers and business owners for his reports. The Los Angeles Weekly Herald, making use of this material, sold more than a thousand copies a week.\nBeginning in 1913 and guided by Hearst-trained editors Edwin R. Collins and John B. T. Campbell, the local coverage for which the Herald was known began to emphasize scandal, crime, and the emerging motion-picture industry. By the 1920s, editors Wes Barr and James H. Richardson were so well known for their investigative reporting that they became the prototypes for the morally ambiguous, chain-smoking reporters who figured in so many film noir movies of the 1930s.\nIn 1922, the Herald officially joined the Hearst News empire, although several sources suggest that Hearst had secretly purchased the paper in 1911, when Collins and Campbell took the helm.\n\n\n== References ==","140":"Los Angeles Street, originally known as Calle de los Negros (Spanish for \"Street of the Black [People]\") is a major thoroughfare in Downtown Los Angeles, California, dating back to the origins of the city as the Pueblo de Los \u00c1ngeles.\n\nLocation\nThe principal length of the street proceeds north from 23rd Street, past Interstate 10, through the Fashion District, past the western edge of Little Tokyo, past the Caltrans District Headquarters, the former Los Angeles Police Department Headquarters at Parker Center and the Los Angeles Mall (which contains City Hall East).\nLos Angeles Street ends at Alameda Street, north of the US 101  near Olvera Street and Union Station.\nIn South Los Angeles there are two other portions of Los Angeles Street, one running from Slauson Avenue to 59th Place and another from 122nd Street to 124th Street near Willowbrook.\n\nHistory\nThe block of Los Angeles Street that runs by the Old Plaza was originally known as \"Calle de los Negros\" or \"Alley of the Black People\". On late 19th century maps it is also marked with a contemporary English translation of that phrase, Nigger Alley. The Chinese massacre of 1871 took place on Los Angeles Street when it was still known as Calle de los Negros. The printing house for the city's first newspaper, Star of Los Angeles, was located on Los Angeles Street, which was known at the time as Calle Zanja Madre (Mother Ditch street).\nLos Angeles Street was the easternmost street in the city's central business district during the 1880s and 1890s. Around Los Angeles and 3rd was the wholesale district, which over time moved further and further southeast into what is now the Fashion District and beyond.\n\nEducation\nSantee Education Complex\n\nLandmarks from Plaza to 3rd Street\nNorthern end of Los Angeles Street\nThe Coronel Adobe was demolished in 1888 and 1896 Sanborn maps show that the Del Valle adobe had been removed, and Los Angeles Street had been extended to form the eastern edge of the Plaza, thus passing in front of the Lugo Adobe. Calle de los Negros remained for a few more decades, behind a row of houses lining the east side of Los Angeles Street between Arcadia and Aliso streets. This was also the western edge of Old Chinatown from around the 1880s through 1930s. It reached eastward across Alameda St. to cover most of the area that is now Union Station. It proceeded one more block past the Plaza, with the buildings on the east side of Olvera Street forming its western edge, until terminating at Alameda Street.\n\nEastern edge of Plaza\nSince the early 1950s, Los Angeles Street has formed the eastern edge of the Plaza, but the buildings lining its eastern edge, including the Lugo Adobe, were removed. The site is now Father Serra Park.\n\nFrom the Plaza north to Alameda\nWhen it was extended past the Plaza in 1888, Los Angeles Street terminated one short block north of the Plaza at Alameda Street. Now, Los Angeles Street turns east at the north side of the Plaza to terminate at Alameda Street at a right angle, directly across from the Union Station complex. What was the short block of Los Angeles Street north of the Plaza is now part of Placita Dolores,  a small open plaza which surrounds a statue of Mexican charro entertainer Antonio Aguilar on horseback.\n\nCalle de los Negros\nUntil the late 19th century, Los Angeles Street did not form the east side of the Plaza; it ran south only from Broad Place at the intersection of Arcadia Street. Here, the Coronel Adobe blocked the path north one block to the Plaza, but just slightly to the right (east) of the path of Los Angeles Street was Calle de los Negros (Spanish-language name; marked on post-1847 maps as Negro Alley or Nigger Alley), a narrow, one-block north\u2013south street likely named after darker-skinned Mexican afromestizo and\/or mulatto residents during the Spanish colonial era.. At the north end of Calle de los Negros stood the Del Valle adobe (also known as the Matthias or Matteo Sabichi house), at the southern edge of which one could turn left and enter the plaza at its southeast corner. Calle de los Negros was famous for its saloons and violence in the early days of the town, and by the 1880s was considered part of Chinatown, lined with Chinese and Chinese American residences, businesses and gambling dens.\nThe neglected dirt alley was already associated with vice by the early 1850s, when a bordello and its owner both known as La Prietita (the dark-skinned lady) were active here. Its other businesses included malodorous livery stables, a pawn shop, a saloon, a theater and a connected restaurant. Historian James Miller Guinn wrote in 1896, \"in the flush days of gold mining, from 1850 to 1856, it was the wickedest street on earth...In length it did not exceed 500 feet, but in wickedness, it was unlimited. On either side it was lined with saloons, gambling hells, dance houses and disreputable dives. It was a cosmopolitan street. Representatives of different races and many nations frequented it. Here the ignoble red man, crazed with aguardiente, fought his battles, the swarthy Sonorian plied his stealthy dagger, and the click of the revolver mingled with the clink of gold at the gaming table when some chivalric American felt that his word of \u201chonah\u201d had been impugned.\"\nBy 1871, the alley was notorious as a \"racially, spatially, and morally disorderly place\", according to historian C\u00e9sar L\u00f3pez. It was here that a growing number of Chinese immigrant railroad laborers settled after the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869. There, William Estrada notes, the \"Chinese of Los Angeles came to fill an important sector of the economy as entrepreneurs. Some became proprietors and employees of small hand laundries and restaurants; some were farmers and wholesale produce peddlers; others ran gambling establishments; and some occupied other areas left vacant by the absence of workers in the gold rush migration to California.\" The Chinese population increased from 14 in 1860 to almost 200 by 1870. Guinn stated that the alley stayed \"wicked\" through and after its transition to the city's Old Chinatown.\nCalle de los Negros was reconfigured in 1888 when Los Angeles Street was extended north, with a small, shallow row of houses remaining between the new section of Los Angeles street's eastern edge and the western edge of the new, shortened alley. The site of Calle de los Negros is now the Pueblo parking lot and a cloverleaf-style entrance to the US 101 freeway.\n\nCoronel Adobe\nThe Coronel Adobe was built in 1840 by Ygnacio Coronel as a family home. It stood at the northwest corner of Arcadia Street and Calle de los Negros; Los Angeles Street terminated at its southern end. The area gradually became an area for gambling and saloons, and upper-class families left to live elsewhere. Around 1849, they sold the house to a \"sporting fraternity\", which operated a popular 24-hour gambling establishment with games including monte, faro, and poker; up to $200,000 in gold could be seen on the tables at a time. Arguments ensued and murders were frequent. The building later became a dance hall where \"lewd women\" were employed, aimed at the Mexican-American population. After that, still in the 1850s, it became a grocery and dry goods store (Corbett & Barker), then a storage house for iron and hard lumber for Harris Newmark Co. It was then leased to a Chinese immigrant. In 1871, it was the site of the Chinese massacre of 1871. The Adobe was torn down in 1888 in order to extend Los Angeles Street north past the Plaza.\n\nGarnier Building\nAt 419 N. Los Angeles Street, at the northwest corner of Arcadia, is the Garnier Building, built in 1890, part of the Los Angeles' original Chinatown. The southern portion of the building was demolished in the 1950s to make way for the Hollywood Freeway. The Chinese American Museum is now located in the Garnier Building. It should not be confused with another Garnier Block\/Building on Main St. a block away now commonly known as Plaza House.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nLos Angeles Street was lined with mostly commercial buildings; the southeast end of the business district around Los Angeles and 3rd streets was the Wholesale District. Only a few buildings were notable:\n\nWest side south of Arcadia\nArcadia Block: southwest corner of Arcadia Street. Built 1858, razed in 1927.\nHellman Block: in 1870, banker and University of Southern California founder Isaias W. Hellman erected the Hellman Block at the northwest corner of Los Angeles and Commercial streets. This is one of several Hellman Blocks or Hellman Buildings in the city.\n\nEast side south of Aliso\nBell Block was at the southeast corner of Aliso Street. It was General John C. Fremont's headquarters and the first Los Angeles City Hall. Captain Alexander Bell and Mellus lived here (Francis Mellus married a niece of Mrs. Bell's). It was taken over by General Fremont for his headquarters and thus became the state capital for the short period of his acting as governor. The Los Angeles City organization was formed in this building in 1850.\nMellus Row, adjacent to Bell Block on the south\nHellman, Haas & Co. grocers (a partnership of Abraham Haas and Herman W.

Not to be confused with the Haas Building.\nBetween Aliso and Temple streets on the east side of Los Angeles St. at #300 is the Federal Building, opened in 1965-6, architect Welton Becket. Temple was extended east of Main Street between Aliso Street and a street that was known as both Requena and Market street. Adjacent and to its east is the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building and United States Courthouse, completed in 1992.\nBetween Temple and First streets is Parker Center, the Los Angeles Police Department headquarters from 1955\u20132009\nAt the southeast corner of First Street, Little Tokyo begins. At this corner was the Tomio Department Store, and two more Japanese-American department stores, the Asia Company and Hori Brothers were located east of it on 1st Street during the 1920s.

Based in the Greater Los Angeles area city of El Segundo since 2018, it is the fifth-largest newspaper in nation and the largest in the Western United States with a print circulation of 118,760 and 500,000 online subscribers. Owned by Patrick Soon-Shiong and published by California Times, the paper has won over 40 Pulitzer Prizes since its founding.\nIn the 19th century, the paper developed a reputation for civic boosterism and opposition to labor unions, the latter of which led to the bombing of its headquarters in 1910. The paper's profile grew substantially in the 1960s under publisher Otis Chandler, who adopted a more national focus. As with other regional newspapers in California and the United States, the paper's readership has declined since 2010. It has also been beset by a series of ownership changes, staff reductions, and other controversies.\nIn January 2018, the paper's staff voted to unionize and finalized their first union contract on October 16, 2019. The paper moved out of its historic headquarters in downtown Los Angeles to a facility in El Segundo, near the Los Angeles International Airport, in July 2018. Since 2020, the newspaper's coverage has since evolved away from national and international news and toward coverage of California and especially Southern California news.\nIn January 2024, the paper underwent its largest percentage reduction in headcount amounting to a layoff of over 20%, including senior staff editorial positions, in an effort to stem the tide of financial losses and maintain enough cash to be viably operational through the end of the year in a struggle for survival and relevance as a regional newspaper of diminished status.\n\nHistory\nOtis era\nThe Times was first published on December 4, 1881, as the Los Angeles Daily Times, under the direction of Nathan Cole Jr. and Thomas Gardiner. It was first printed at the Mirror printing plant, owned by Jesse Yarnell and T. J. Caystile. Unable to pay the printing bill, Cole and Gardiner turned the paper over to the Mirror Company. In the meantime, S. J. Mathes had joined the firm, and it was at his insistence that the Times continued publication. In July 1882, Harrison Gray Otis moved from Santa Barbara, California to become the paper's editor. At the same time he also purchased a 1\/4 stake in the paper for $6,000 mostly secured on a bank loan.\nHistorian Kevin Starr wrote that Otis was a businessman \"capable of manipulating the entire apparatus of politics and public opinion for his own enrichment\". Otis's editorial policy was based on civic boosterism, extolling the virtues of Los Angeles and promoting its growth. Toward those ends, the paper supported efforts to expand the city's water supply by acquiring the rights to the water supply of the distant Owens Valley.\nThe efforts of the Times to fight local unions led to the bombing of its headquarters on October 1, 1910, killing 21 people. Two of the union leaders, James and Joseph McNamara, were charged. The American Federation of Labor hired noted trial attorney Clarence Darrow to represent the brothers, who eventually pleaded guilty.\nOtis fastened a bronze eagle on top of a high frieze of the new Times headquarters building designed by Gordon Kaufmann, proclaiming anew the credo written by his wife, Eliza: \"Stand Fast, Stand Firm, Stand Sure, Stand True\".\n\nChandler era\nAfter Otis' death in 1917, his son-in-law and the paper's business manager, Harry Chandler, took control as publisher of the Times. Chandler was succeeded in 1944 by his son, Norman Chandler, who ran the paper during the rapid growth in Los Angeles following the end of World War I. Norman's wife, Dorothy Buffum Chandler, became active in civic affairs and led the effort to build the Los Angeles Music Center, whose main concert hall was named the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in her honor. Family members are buried at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery near Paramount Studios. The site also includes a memorial to the Times Building bombing victims.\nIn 1935, the newspaper moved to a new, landmark Art Deco building, the Los Angeles Times Building, to which the newspaper would add other facilities until taking up the entire city block between Spring, Broadway, First and Second streets, which came to be known as Times Mirror Square and would house the paper until 2018. Harry Chandler, then the president and general manager of Times-Mirror Co., declared the Los Angeles Times Building a \"monument to the progress of our city and Southern California\".\nThe fourth generation of family publishers, Otis Chandler, held that position from 1960 till 1980. Otis Chandler sought legitimacy and recognition for his family's paper, often forgotten in the power centers of the Northeastern United States due to its geographic and cultural distance. He sought to remake the paper in the model of the nation's most respected newspapers, such as The New York Times and The Washington Post. Believing that the newsroom was \"the heartbeat of the business\", Otis Chandler increased the size and pay of the reporting staff and expanded its national and international reporting. In 1962, the paper joined with The Washington Post to form the Los Angeles Times\u2013Washington Post News Service to syndicate articles from both papers for other news organizations. He also toned down the unyielding conservatism that had characterized the paper over the years, adopting a much more centrist editorial stance.\nDuring the 1960s, the paper won four Pulitzer Prizes, more than its previous nine decades combined.\nIn 2013, Times reporter Michael Hiltzik wrote that:\n\nThe first generations bought or founded their local paper for profits and also social and political influence (which often brought more profits). Their children enjoyed both profits and influence, but as the families grew larger, the later generations found that only one or two branches got the power, and everyone else got a share of the money. Eventually the coupon-clipping branches realized that they could make more money investing in something other than newspapers. Under their pressure the companies went public, or split apart, or disappeared. That's the pattern followed over more than a century by the Los Angeles Times under the Chandler family.\n\nThe paper's early history and subsequent transformation was chronicled in an unauthorized history, Thinking Big (1977, ISBN 0-399-11766-0), and was one of four organizations profiled by David Halberstam in The Powers That Be (1979, ISBN 0-394-50381-3; 2000 reprint ISBN 0-252-06941-2). It has also been the whole or partial subject of nearly thirty dissertations in communications or social science in the past four decades.\n\nFormer Times buildings\nThe Los Angeles Times has occupied five physical sites beginning in 1881.\n\nModern era\nThe Los Angeles Times was beset in the first decade of the 21st century by a change in ownership, a bankruptcy, a rapid succession of editors, reductions in staff, decreases in paid circulation, the need to increase its Web presence, and a series of controversies. In January 2024, the newsroom announced a roughly 20 percent reduction in staff, due to anemic subscription growth and other financial struggles.\nThe newspaper moved to a new headquarters building in El Segundo, near Los Angeles International Airport, in July 2018.\n\nOwnership\nIn 2000, Times Mirror Company, publisher of the Los Angeles Times, was purchased by the Tribune Company of Chicago, Illinois, placing the paper in co-ownership with the then WB-affiliated (now CW-affiliated) KTLA, which Tribune acquired in 1985.\nOn April 2, 2007, the Tribune Company announced its acceptance of real estate entrepreneur Sam Zell's offer to buy the Chicago Tribune,  the Los Angeles Times, and all other company assets. Zell announced that he would sell the Chicago Cubs baseball club. He put up for sale the company's 25 percent interest in Comcast SportsNet Chicago. Until shareholder approval was received, Los Angeles billionaires Ron Burkle and Eli Broad had the right to submit a higher bid, in which case Zell would have received a $25 million buyout fee.\nIn December 2008, the Tribune Company filed for bankruptcy protection. The bankruptcy was a result of declining advertising revenue and a debt load of $12.9 billion, much of it incurred when the paper was taken private by Zell.\nOn February 7, 2018, Tribune Publishing, formerly Tronc Inc., agreed to sell the Los Angeles Times and its two other southern California newspapers, The San Diego Union-Tribune and Hoy, to billionaire biotech investor Patrick Soon-Shiong. This purchase by Soon-Shiong through his Nant Capital investment fund was for $500 million, as well as the assumption of $90 million in pension liabilities. The sale to Soon-Shiong closed on June 16, 2018.\n\nEditorial changes and staff reductions\nIn 2000, John Carroll, former editor of the Baltimore Sun, was brought in to restore the luster of the newspaper. During his reign at the Times, he eliminated more than 200 jobs, but despite an operating profit margin of 20 percent, the Tribune executives were unsatisfied with returns, and by 2005 Carroll had left the newspaper. His successor, Dean Baquet, refused to impose the additional cutbacks mandated by the Tribune Company.\nBaquet was the first African-American to hold this type of editorial position at a top-tier daily. During Baquet and Carroll's time at the paper, it won 13 Pulitzer Prizes, more than any other paper except The New York Times. However, Baquet was removed from the editorship for not meeting the demands of the Tribune Group\u2014as was publisher Jeffrey Johnson\u2014and was replaced by James O'Shea of the Chicago Tribune. O'Shea himself left in January 2008 after a budget dispute with publisher David Hiller.\nThe paper reported on July 3, 2008, that it planned to cut 250 jobs by Labor Day and reduce the number of published pages by 15 percent. That included about 17 percent of the news staff, as part of the newly private media company's mandate to reduce costs. \"We've tried to get ahead of all the change that's occurring in the business and get to an organization and size that will be sustainable\", Hiller said. In January 2009, the Times eliminated the separate California\/Metro section, folding it into the front section of the newspaper. The Times also announced seventy job cuts in news and editorial or a 10 percent cut in payroll.\nIn September 2015, Austin Beutner, the publisher and chief executive, was replaced by Timothy E. Ryan. On October 5, 2015, the Poynter Institute reported that \"'At least 50' editorial positions will be culled from the Los Angeles Times\" through a buyout. In June 2009, with foresight, the Los Angeles Times reported, \"For the 'funemployed,' unemployment is welcome.\" Nancy Cleeland, who took O'Shea's buyout offer, did so because of \"frustration with the paper's coverage of working people and organized labor\" (the beat that earned her Pulitzer). She speculated that the paper's revenue shortfall could be reversed by expanding coverage of economic justice topics, which she believed were increasingly relevant to Southern California; she cited the paper's attempted hiring of a \"celebrity justice reporter\" as an example of the wrong approach.\nOn August 21, 2017, Ross Levinsohn, then aged 54, was named publisher and CEO, replacing Davan Maharaj, who had been both publisher and editor. On June 16, 2018, the same day the sale to Patrick Soon-Shiong closed, Norman Pearlstine was named executive editor.\nOn May 3, 2021, the newspaper announced that it had selected Kevin Merida to be the new executive editor. Merida is a senior vice president at ESPN and leads The Undefeated, a site focused on sports, race, and culture. Previously, he was the first Black managing editor at The Washington Post.\nThe Los Angeles Times Olympic Boulevard printing press was not purchased by Soon-Shiong and was kept by the original Tribune before being sold to developers in 2016, who plan to build sound stages on the property. It was opened in 1990 and could print 70,000 96-page newspapers an hour. In preparation for the closure and editorial reasons for refocusing sports coverage, daily game and box score coverage was eliminated on July 9, 2023. The sports section features less time sensitive articles, billed as similar to a magazine. The change caused consternation from the Los Angeles Jewish community, who often found reading box scores in the morning a Shabbat ritual. The last issue of the Times printed at Olympic Boulevard was the March 11, 2024, edition. The Times will be printed in Riverside, at the Southern California News Group's Press-Enterprise printer, which also prints Southern California editions of the New York Times and Wall Street Journal.\nOn January 23, 2024, the newspaper announced a layoff that would affect at least 115 employees. It named Terry Tang its next executive editor on April 8, 2024.\n\nCirculation\nThe Times has suffered continued decline in distribution. Reasons offered for the circulation drop included a price increase and a rise in the proportion of readers preferring to read the online version instead of the print version. Editor Jim O'Shea, in an internal memo announcing a May 2007, mostly voluntary, reduction in force, characterized the decrease in circulation as an \"industry-wide problem\" which the paper had to counter by \"growing rapidly on-line\", \"break[ing] news on the Web and explain[ing] and analyz[ing] it in our newspaper.\"\nThe Times closed its San Fernando Valley printing plant in early 2006, leaving press operations to the Olympic plant and to Orange County. Also that year the paper announced its circulation had fallen to 851,532, down 5.4 percent from 2005. The Times's loss of circulation was the largest of the top ten newspapers in the U.S. Some observers believed that the drop was due to the retirement of circulation director Bert Tiffany. Others thought the decline was a side effect of a succession of short-lived editors who were appointed by publisher Mark Willes after publisher Otis Chandler relinquished day-to-day control in 1995. Willes, the former president of General Mills, was criticized for his lack of understanding of the newspaper business, and was derisively referred to by reporters and editors as The Cereal Killer. Subsequently, the Orange County plant closed in 2010.\nThe Times's reported daily circulation in October 2010 was 600,449, down from a peak of 1,225,189 daily and 1,514,096 Sunday in April 1990.\n\nInternet presence and free weeklies\nIn December 2006, a team of Times reporters delivered management with a critique of the paper's online news efforts known as the Spring Street Project. The report, which condemned the Times as a \"web-stupid\" organization, was followed by a shakeup in management of the paper's website, and a rebuke of print staffers who were described as treating \"change as a threat.\"\nOn July 10, 2007, Times launched a local Metromix site targeting live entertainment for young adults. A free weekly tabloid print edition of Metromix Los Angeles followed in February 2008; the publication was the newspaper's first stand-alone print weekly. In 2009, the Times shut down Metromix and replaced it with Brand X, a blog site and free weekly tabloid targeting young, social networking readers. Brand X launched in March 2009; the Brand X tabloid ceased publication in June 2011 and the website was shut down the following month.\nIn May 2018, the Times blocked access to its online edition from most of Europe because of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation.\n\nOther controversies\nIn 1999, it was revealed that a revenue-sharing arrangement was in place between the Times and Staples Center in the preparation of a 168-page magazine about the opening of the sports arena. The magazine's editors and writers were not informed of the agreement, which breached the Chinese wall that traditionally has separated advertising from journalistic functions at American newspapers. Publisher Mark Willes also had not prevented advertisers from pressuring reporters in other sections of the newspaper to write stories favorable to their point of view.\nMichael Kinsley was hired as the Opinion and Editorial (op-ed) Editor in April 2004 to help improve the quality of the opinion pieces. His role was controversial, for he forced writers to take a more decisive stance on issues. In 2005, he created a Wikitorial, the first Wiki by a major news organization. Although it failed, readers could combine forces to produce their own editorial pieces. It was shut down after being besieged with inappropriate material. He resigned later that year.\nIn 2003, the Times drew fire for a last-minute story before the California recall election alleging that gubernatorial candidate Arnold Schwarzenegger groped scores of women during his movie career. Columnist Jill Stewart wrote on the American Reporter website that the Times did not do a story on allegations that former Governor Gray Davis had verbally and physically abused women in his office, and that the Schwarzenegger story relied on a number of anonymous sources. Further, she said, four of the six alleged victims were not named. She also said that in the case of the Davis allegations, the Times decided against printing the Davis story because of its reliance on anonymous sources. The American Society of Newspaper Editors said that the Times lost more than 10,000 subscribers because of the negative publicity surrounding the Schwarzenegger article.\nOn November 12, 2005, new op-ed editor Andr\u00e9s Martinez announced the dismissal of liberal op-ed columnist Robert Scheer and conservative editorial cartoonist Michael Ramirez.\nThe Times also came under controversy for its decision to drop the weekday edition of the Garfield comic strip in 2005, in favor of a hipper comic strip Brevity, while retaining it in the Sunday edition. Garfield was dropped altogether shortly thereafter.\nFollowing the Republican Party's defeat in the 2006 mid-term elections, an Opinion piece by Joshua Muravchik, a leading neoconservative and a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, published on November 19, 2006, was titled 'Bomb Iran'. The article shocked some readers, with its hawkish comments in support of more unilateral action by the United States, this time against Iran.\nOn March 22, 2007, editorial page editor Andr\u00e9s Martinez resigned following an alleged scandal centering on his girlfriend's professional relationship with a Hollywood producer who had been asked to guest-edit a section in the newspaper. In an open letter written upon leaving the paper, Martinez criticized the publication for allowing the Chinese wall between the news and editorial departments to be weakened, accusing news staffers of lobbying the opinion desk.\nIn November 2017, Walt Disney Studios blacklisted the Times from attending press screenings of its films, in retaliation for September 2017 reportage by the paper on Disney's political influence in the Anaheim area. The company considered the coverage to be \"biased and inaccurate\". As a sign of condemnation and solidarity, a number of major publications and writers, including The New York Times,  Boston Globe critic Ty Burr, Washington Post blogger Alyssa Rosenberg, and the websites The A.V. Club and Flavorwire, announced that they would boycott press screenings of future Disney films. The National Society of Film Critics, Los Angeles Film Critics Association, New York Film Critics Circle, and Boston Society of Film Critics jointly announced that Disney's films would be ineligible for their respective year-end awards unless the decision was reversed, condemning the decision as being \"antithetical to the principles of a free press and [setting] a dangerous precedent in a time of already heightened hostility towards journalists\". On November 7, 2017, Disney reversed its decision, stating that the company \"had productive discussions with the newly installed leadership at the Los Angeles Times regarding our specific concerns\".\n\nPulitzer Prizes\nAs of 2014, the Times has won 41 Pulitzer Prizes, including four in editorial cartooning, and one each in spot news reporting for the 1965 Watts Riots and the 1992 Los Angeles riots.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times photographer John L. Gaunt Jr. won a 1955 Tragedy by the Sea (pictured) won the Pulitzer Prize for Photography. The image was published April 3, 1954.\nThe Los Angeles Times received the 1984 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for the newspaper series \"Latinos\".\nTimes sportswriter Jim Murray won a Pulitzer in 1990.\nTimes investigative reporters Chuck Philips and Michael Hiltzik won the Pulitzer in 1999 for a year-long series that exposed corruption in the music business.\nTimes journalist David Willman won the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting; the organization cited \"his pioneering expose of seven unsafe prescription drugs that had been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and an analysis of the policy reforms that had reduced the agency's effectiveness.\" In 2004, the paper won five prizes, which is the third-most by any paper in one year (behind The New York Times in 2002 (7) and The Washington Post in 2008 (6)).\nTimes reporters Bettina Boxall and Julie Cart won a Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting in 2009 \"for their fresh and painstaking exploration into the cost and effectiveness of attempts to combat the growing menace of wildfires across the western United States.\"\nIn 2011, Barbara Davidson was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography \"for her intimate story of innocent victims trapped in the city's crossfire of deadly gang violence.\"\nIn 2016, the Times won the breaking news Pulitzer prize for its coverage of the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California.\nIn 2019, three Los Angeles Times reporters, Harriet Ryan, Matt Hamilton and Paul Pringle, won a Pulitzer Prize for their investigation into a gynecologist accused of abusing hundreds of students at the University of Southern California.\n\nCompetition and rivalries\nIn the 19th century, the chief competition to the Times was the Los Angeles Examiner followed by the smaller Los Angeles Tribune. In December 1903, newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst began publishing the Los Angeles Examiner as a direct morning competitor to the Times. In the 20th century, the Los Angeles Express, Manchester Boddy's Los Angeles Daily News, a Democratic newspaper, were both afternoon competitors.\nBy the mid-1940s, the Times was the leading newspaper in terms of circulation in the Greater Los Angeles. In 1948, it launched the Los Angeles Mirror, an afternoon tabloid, to compete with both the Daily News and the merged Herald-Express. In 1954, the Mirror absorbed the Daily News. The combined paper, the Mirror-News, ceased publication in 1962, when the Hearst afternoon Herald-Express and the morning Los Angeles Examiner merged to become the Herald-Examiner. The Herald-Examiner published its last number in 1989.\nIn 2014, the Los Angeles Register, published by Freedom Communications, then-parent company of the Orange County Register, was launched as a daily newspaper to compete with the Times. By late September of that year, however, the Los Angeles Register closed.\n\nSpecial editions\nMidwinter and midsummer\nMidwinter\nFor 69 years, from 1885 until 1954, the Times issued on New Year's Day a special annual Midwinter Number or Midwinter Edition that extolled the virtues of Southern California. At first, it was called the \"Trade Number\", and in 1886 it featured a special press run of \"extra scope and proportions\"; that is, \"a twenty-four-page paper, and we hope to make it the finest exponent of this [Southern California] country that ever existed.\" Two years later, the edition had grown to \"forty-eight handsome pages (9\u00d715 inches), [which] stitched for convenience and better preservation\", was \"equivalent to a 150-page book.\" The last use of the phrase Trade Number was in 1895, when the edition had grown to thirty-six pages split among three separate sections.\nThe Midwinter Number drew acclamations from other newspapers, including this one from The Kansas City Star in 1923:\n\nIt is made up of five magazines with a total of 240 pages \u2013 the maximum size possible under the postal regulations. It goes into every detail of information about Los Angeles and Southern California that the heart could desire. It is virtually a cyclopedia on the subject. It drips official statistics. In addition, it verifies the statistics with a profusion of illustration. . . . it is a remarkable combination of guidebook and travel magazine.\nIn 1948, the Midwinter Edition, as it was then called, had grown to \"7 big picture magazines in beautiful rotogravure reproduction.\" The last mention of the Midwinter Edition was in a Times advertisement on January 10, 1954.\n\nMidsummer\nBetween 1891 and 1895, the Times also issued a similar Midsummer Number, the first one featuring the theme, \"The Land and Its Fruits\". Because of its issue date in September, the edition was in 1891 called the Midsummer Harvest Number.\n\nZoned editions and subsidiaries\nIn 1903, Pacific Wireless Telegraph Company established a radiotelegraph link between the California mainland and Santa Catalina Island. In the summer of that year, the Times made use of this link to establish a local daily paper, based in Avalon, The Wireless, which featured local news plus excerpts which had been transmitted via Morse code from the parent paper. However, this effort apparently survived for only a little more than one year.\nIn the 1990s, the Times published various editions catering to far-flung areas. Editions included those from the San Fernando Valley, Ventura County, Inland Empire, Orange County, San Diego County & a \"National Edition\" that was distributed to Washington, D.C., and the San Francisco Bay Area. Overall, there were 14 editions succeeded by Our Times, a group of community supplements included in editions of the regular Los Angeles Metro newspaper, with the Our Times editions ceasing publication in 2000.\nA subsidiary, Times Community Newspapers, publishes the Daily Pilot of Newport Beach and Costa Mesa. From 2011 to 2013, the Times had published the Pasadena Sun. It also had published the Glendale News-Press and Burbank Leader from 1993 to 2020, and the La Ca\u00f1ada Valley Sun from 2005 to 2020.\nOn April 30, 2020, Charlie Plowman, publisher of Outlook Newspapers, announced he would acquire the Glendale News-Press,\nBurbank Leader and La Ca\u00f1ada Valley Sun from Times Community Newspapers. Plowman acquired the South Pasadena Review and San Marino Tribune in late January 2020 from the Salter family, who owned and operated these two community weeklies.\n\nFeatures\nOne of the Times' features was \"Column One\", a feature that appeared daily on the front page to the left-hand side. Established in September 1968, it was a place for the weird and the interesting; in the How Far Can a Piano Fly? (a compilation of Column One stories) introduction, Patt Morrison wrote that the column's purpose was to elicit a \"Gee, that's interesting, I didn't know that\" type of reaction.\nThe Times also embarked on a number of investigative journalism pieces. A series in December 2004 on the King\/Drew Medical Center in Los Angeles led to a Pulitzer Prize and a more thorough coverage of the hospital's troubled history. Lopez wrote a five-part series on the civic and humanitarian disgrace of Los Angeles' Skid Row, which became the focus of a 2009 motion picture, The Soloist. The paper also won 75 awards at the 2020 Society for News Design (SND) awards for work completed in 2019.\nFrom 1967 to 1972, the Times produced a Sunday supplement called West magazine. West was recognized for its art design, which was directed by Mike Salisbury (who later became art director of Rolling Stone magazine). From 2000 to 2012, the Times published the Los Angeles Times Magazine, which started as a weekly and then became a monthly supplement. The magazine focused on stories and photos of people, places, style, and other cultural affairs occurring in Los Angeles and its surrounding cities and communities. In 2014, The California Sunday Magazine was included in the Sunday L.A. Times edition, but stopped publishing in 2020.\nIn 2024, the Times published an \"L.A. Influential\" series, featuring the city's most prominent moguls, artists, community leaders, and others. The feature is arranged in six categories, based on industry and other details.\n\nPromotion\nFestival of Books\nIn 1996, the Times started the annual Los Angeles Times Festival of Books, in association with the University of California, Los Angeles. It has panel discussions, exhibits, and stages during two days at the end of April each year. In 2011, the Festival of Books was moved to the University of Southern California.\n\nBook prizes\nSince 1980, the Times has awarded annual book prizes. The categories are now biography, current interest, fiction, first fiction, history, mystery\/thriller, poetry, science and technology, and young adult fiction. In addition, the Robert Kirsch Award is presented annually to a living author with a substantial connection to the American West whose contribution to American letters deserves special recognition\".\n\nLos Angeles Times Grand Prix\nFrom 1957 to 1987, the Times sponsored the Los Angeles Times Grand Prix that was held over at the Riverside International Raceway in Moreno Valley, California.\n\nOther media\nBook publishing\nThe Times Mirror Corporation has also owned a number of book publishers over the years, including New American Library, C.V. Mosby, Harry N. Abrams, Matthew Bender, and Jeppesen.\nIn 1960, Times Mirror of Los Angeles bought the book publisher New American Library, known for publishing affordable paperback reprints of classics and other scholarly works. The NAL continued to operate autonomously from New York and within the Mirror Company. In 1983, Odyssey Partners and Ira J. Hechler bought NAL from the Times Mirror Company for over $50 million.\nIn 1967, Times Mirror acquired C.V. Mosby Company, a professional publisher and merged it over the years with several other professional publishers including Resource Application, Inc., Year Book Medical Publishers, Wolfe Publishing Ltd., PSG Publishing Company, B.C. Decker, Inc., among others. Eventually in 1998 Mosby was sold to Harcourt Brace & Company to form the Elsevier Health Sciences group.\n\nBroadcasting activities\nThe Times-Mirror Company was a founding owner of television station KTTV in Los Angeles, which opened in January 1949. It became that station's sole owner in 1951, after re-acquiring the minority shares it had sold to CBS in 1948. Times-Mirror also purchased a former motion picture studio, Nassour Studios, in Hollywood in 1950, which was then used to consolidate KTTV's operations. Later to be known as Metromedia Square, the studio was sold along with KTTV to Metromedia in 1963.\nAfter a seven-year hiatus from the medium, the firm reactivated Times-Mirror Broadcasting Company with its 1970 purchase of the Dallas Times Herald and its radio and television stations, KRLD-AM-FM-TV in Dallas. The Federal Communications Commission granted an exemption of its cross-ownership policy and allowed Times-Mirror to retain the newspaper and the television outlet, which was renamed KDFW-TV.\nTimes-Mirror Broadcasting later acquired KTBC-TV in Austin, Texas in 1973; and in 1980 purchased a group of stations owned by Newhouse Newspapers: WAPI-TV (now WVTM-TV) in Birmingham, Alabama; KTVI in St. Louis; WSYR-TV (now WSTM-TV) in Syracuse, New York and its satellite station WSYE-TV (now WETM-TV) in Elmira, New York; and WTPA-TV (now WHTM-TV) in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.  The company also entered the field of cable television, servicing the Phoenix and San Diego areas, amongst others. They were originally titled Times-Mirror Cable, and were later renamed to Dimension Cable Television. Similarly, they also attempted to enter the pay-TV market, with the Spotlight movie network; it was not successful and was quickly shut down. The cable systems were sold in the mid-1990s to Cox Communications.\nTimes-Mirror also pared its station group down, selling off the Syracuse, Elmira and Harrisburg properties in 1986. The remaining four outlets were packaged to a new upstart holding company, Argyle Television, in 1993. These stations were acquired by New World Communications shortly thereafter and became key components in a sweeping shift of network-station affiliations which occurred between 1994 and 1995.\n\nStations\nNotes:\n\n1 Co-owned with CBS until 1951 in a joint venture (51% owned by Times-Mirror, 49% owned by CBS);\n2 Purchased along with KRLD-AM-FM as part of Times-Mirror's acquisition of the Dallas Times Herald. Times-Mirror sold the radio stations to comply with FCC cross-ownership restrictions.\n\nEmployees\nUnionization\nOn January 19, 2018, employees of the news department voted 248\u201344 in a National Labor Relations Board election to be represented by the NewsGuild-CWA. The vote came despite aggressive opposition from the paper's management team, reversing more than a century of anti-union sentiment at one of the largest newspapers in the country.\n\nWriters and editors\nCartoonists\nPhotographers\nReferences\nFurther reading\nBerges, Marshall (1984).

The Los Angeles\u2013Anaheim\u2013Riverside combined statistical area (CSA) covers 33,954 square miles (87,940 km2), making it the largest metropolitan region in the United States by land area. The contiguous urban area is 2,281 square miles (5,910 km2), whereas the remainder mostly consists of mountain and desert areas. With a population of 20.6 million in 2024, it is the second-largest metropolitan area in the country, behind New York, as well as one of the largest megacities in the world.\nIn addition to being the nexus of the global entertainment industry, including films, television, and recorded music, Greater Los Angeles is also an important center of international trade, education, media, business, tourism, technology, and sports. It is the third-largest metropolitan area by nominal GDP in the world with an economy exceeding $1 trillion in output, behind New York City and Tokyo.\nThere are three contiguous component urban areas in Greater Los Angeles: the Inland Empire, which can be broadly defined as Riverside and San Bernardino counties; the Ventura\/Oxnard metropolitan area (Ventura County); and the Los Angeles metropolitan area (also known as Metropolitan Los Angeles or Metro LA) consisting of Los Angeles and Orange counties only. The Census Bureau designates the latter as the Los Angeles\u2013Long Beach\u2013Anaheim metropolitan statistical area (MSA), the fourth largest metropolitan area in the western hemisphere and the second-largest metropolitan area in the United States, by population of 13 million as of the 2020 U.S. census. It has a total area of 4,850 square miles (12,561 km2). Although San Diego\u2013Tijuana borders the Greater Los Angeles area at San Clemente and Temecula, it is not part of it as the two urban areas are not geographically contiguous due to the presence of Camp Pendleton. However, both form part of the Southern California Megalopolis which extends into Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico. Throughout the 20th century, Greater Los Angeles was one of the fastest-growing regions in the United States, but growth has slowed since 2000.\n\nDefinitions\nLos Angeles metropolitan area\nThe Los Angeles metropolitan area is defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget as the Los Angeles\u2013Long Beach\u2013Anaheim, CA Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), with a 2021 population of 12,997,353. The MSA is in turn made up of two \"metropolitan divisions\":\n\nLos Angeles\u2013Long Beach\u2013Glendale, CA Metropolitan Division, coterminous with Los Angeles County (2021 population 9,829,544)\nAnaheim\u2013Santa Ana\u2013Irvine, CA Metropolitan Division, coterminous with Orange County (2021 population 3,167,809)\nThe MSA is the most populous metropolitan area in the Western United States and second-most populous in the United States. It has at its core the Los Angeles\u2013Long Beach\u2013Anaheim urban area, which had a population of 12,237,376 as of the 2020 census.\n\nGreater Los Angeles\nThe U.S. Census Bureau also defines a wider commercial region based on commuting patterns, the Los Angeles\u2013Long Beach, CA Combined Statistical Area (CSA), more commonly known as the Greater Los Angeles Area, with an estimated population of 18,422,600 in 2024. The total land area of the CSA is 33,955 sq. mi (87,945 km2).\nThe CSA consists of three component metropolitan areas:\n\nThe Los Angeles\u2013Long Beach\u2013Anaheim, CA MSA (2021 pop. 12,997,353)\nThe Oxnard\u2013Thousand Oaks\u2013Ventura, CA MSA, coterminous with Ventura County (2021 pop. 839,784)\nThe Riverside\u2013San Bernardino\u2013Ontario, CA MSA (2021 pop. 4,653,105), consisting of:\nRiverside County, California (2021 pop. 2,458,395)\nSan Bernardino County, California (2021 pop. 2,194,710)\n\nHistory\nNearly all of the metropolitan area of Greater Los Angeles is located within the homelands of the Tongva, otherwise referred to as Tovaangar.\n\nGeography\nUrban form\nLos Angeles has long been famous for its sprawl, but this has to do more with its status in history as the \"poster child\" of large cities that grew up with suburban-style patterns of development, rather than how it ranks in sprawl among American metro areas today, now that suburban and exurban-style development is present across the country. The Los Angeles\u2013Orange County metro area was the most densely populated \"urbanized area\" (as defined by the United States Census Bureau) in the United States in 2000, with 7,068 inhabitants per square mile (2,729\/km2). For comparison, the \"New York\u2013Newark\" Urbanized Area had a population density of 5,309 per square mile (2,050\/km2).\nLos Angeles' reputation for sprawl is due to the fact that the city grew from relative obscurity to one of the country's ten largest cities (i.e. 10th largest city in 1920), at a time when suburban patterns of growth first became possible due to electric streetcars and automobiles. The city was also the first large American city where, in the 1920s, major clusters of regional employment, shopping, and culture were already being built outside the traditional downtown areas \u2013 in edge cities such as Mid-Wilshire, Miracle Mile and Hollywood. This pattern of growth continued ever outward, more so when the freeway system was built starting in the 1950s; thus Greater Los Angeles was the earliest large American metropolitan area with a decentralized structure. Its major commercial, financial, and cultural institutions are geographically dispersed rather than being concentrated in a single downtown or central area. Also, the population density of Los Angeles proper is low (approximately 8,300 people per square mile) when compared to some other large American cities such as New York City (27,500), San Francisco (17,000), Boston (13,300), and Chicago (11,800). Densities are particularly high within a 5-mile radius of downtown, where some neighborhoods exceed 20,000 people per square mile. What gives the entire Los Angeles metro region a high density is the fact that many of the city's suburbs and satellite cities have high density rates. Within its urbanized areas, Los Angeles is noted for having small lot sizes and low-rise buildings. Buildings in the area are low when compared to other large cities, mainly due to zoning regulations. Los Angeles became a major city just as the Pacific Electric Railway spread population to smaller cities much as interurbans did in East Coast cities. In the first decades of the twentieth century, the area was marked by a network of fairly dense but separate cities linked by rail. The ascendance of the automobile helped fill in the gaps between these commuter towns with lower-density settlements.\nStarting in the early twentieth century, there was a large growth in population on the western edges of the city moving to the San Fernando Valley and out into the Conejo Valley in eastern Ventura County. Many working-class whites migrated to this area during the 1960s and 1970s out of East and Central Los Angeles. As a result, there was a large growth in population into the Conejo Valley and into Ventura County through the US 101 corridor. Making the US 101 a full freeway in the 1960s and expansions that followed helped make commuting to Los Angeles easier and opened the way for development westward. Development in Ventura County and along the US 101 corridor remains controversial, with open-space advocates battling those who feel business development is necessary to economic growth. Although the area still has abundant amount of open space and land, almost all of it was put aside and mandated never to be developed as part of the master plan of each city. Because of this, the area which was once a relatively inexpensive area to buy real estate, saw rising real estate prices well into the 2000s. Median home prices in the Conejo Valley for instance, ranged from $700,000 to $2.2 million in 2003. According to Forbes, \"it's nearly impossible\" to find reasonably priced real estate in California, and the prices will continue to increase.\nThe Los Angeles area continues to grow, principally on the periphery where new, cheaper, undeveloped areas are being sought. As such, in these areas, populations as well as housing prices exploded, although the housing bubble popped late in the decade of the 2000s. Riverside and San Bernardino Counties, which contain large swaths of desert, attracted most of the population increase between 2000 and 2006. Growth continues not only outside the existing urbanized area but also adjacent to existing development in the central areas. As in virtually all US core cities, there is now vigorous residential development in the downtown area with both new buildings and renovation of former office buildings. The Los Angeles Downtown News keeps a list of ongoing development projects, updated every quarter. Over the course of the 21st century, droughts and wildfires have increased in frequency and the region's water security has become a development issue.\n\nMajor business districts and edge cities\nGreater Los Angeles has numerous traditional downtowns or central business districts, the largest being Downtown Los Angeles. Other important ones are Downtown Long Beach, downtown Pasadena, downtown Glendale, and downtown Burbank, and \u2013 with their county, state and federal government facilities \u2013 Downtown Santa Ana, Downtown Anaheim, Downtown Riverside, Downtown San Bernardino, downtown Irvine, and downtown Ontario.\nHowever, most of the commercial activity (office space, retail, hotels, entertainment) is found outside traditional downtowns, among the suburban-style development in clusters known as edge cities. In fact, the Los Angeles area is considered the classic example of a metropolitan area that developed in this pattern, because it did so early in history, starting in the 1920s, and was the city to enter into the top ten of American cities while growing in this pattern.\n\nIdentity\nEmployment is not only in the downtown area, but consistently occurs outside the central core. As such, many people commute throughout the city and suburbs in various directions for their work and daily activities, with a large portion heading to the municipalities that are outside the city of Los Angeles.\nUnlike most metropolitan areas, regional identity remains a contentious issue in the Greater Los Angeles area, with many residents not acknowledging any association with the region as a whole. For example, while Los Angeles County and Orange County together make up the smaller MSA region, the two host many sub-areas that each have sharp demographic, political, and financial distinctions. South Orange County residents often attempt to be identified apart from Los Angeles although they make up the same metropolitan area. Also, while only 1.63% of Los Angeles residents commute to Orange County for work, over 6% of Orange County commuters head to Los Angeles for work. Western Riverside County and San Bernardino County have become commuter regions characteristic of other suburban counties throughout the nation. Residents in these counties often commute to Los Angeles County and Orange County for employment.\n\nComponent counties, subregions, and cities\nLos Angeles County\nLos Angeles County, of which the City of Los Angeles is the county seat, is the most populous county in the United States and is home to over a quarter of all California residents. The large size of the city of Los Angeles, as well as its history of annexing smaller towns, has made city boundaries in the central area of Los Angeles County quite complicated. Many cities are completely surrounded by the city of Los Angeles and are often included in the city's areas despite being independent municipalities. For example, Santa Monica and Beverly Hills (which is almost completely surrounded by Los Angeles) are considered part of the Westside, while Hawthorne and Inglewood are associated with South L.A. Adjacent areas that are outside the actual city boundaries of incorporated Los Angeles but border the city itself include the Santa Clarita Valley, the San Gabriel Valley, South Bay, and the Gateway Cities.\nDespite the large footprint of the city of Los Angeles, a majority of the land area within Los Angeles County is unincorporated and under the primary jurisdiction of Los Angeles County. Much of this land, however, cannot be easily developed due to planning challenges presented by geographic features such as the Santa Monica Mountains, the San Gabriel Mountains, and the Mojave Desert. Actual land development in these regions occurs on the fringes of incorporated cities, some of which have been fully developed, such as the cities of Palmdale and Lancaster.\n\nSubregions in Los Angeles County\nWhile there is not an official designation for the regions that comprise Greater Los Angeles, one authority, the Los Angeles Times, divides the area into the following regions:\n\nAngeles Forest\nAntelope Valley\nCentral L.A. (Downtown Los Angeles, Hollywood, Mid-Wilshire, etc.)\nEastside\nGateway Cities\/Harbor Area\nNortheast L.A. (Highland Park, Eagle Rock, etc.)\nNorthwest L.A. County (including the Santa Clarita Valley)\nPomona Valley (partially in San Bernardino County)\nSan Fernando Valley\nSan Gabriel Valley\nSanta Clarita Valley\nSanta Monica Mountains (Malibu, Topanga, etc.)\nSouth Bay (incl. Palos Verdes Peninsula, Beach Cities)\nSouth Los Angeles\nSoutheast Los Angeles County (including Norwalk and Whittier, see Gateway Cities)\nThe Verdugos (including Glendale, Pasadena and the Crescenta Valley)\nWestside\nSome of the above areas can be defined as being bounded by natural features such as mountains or the ocean; others are marked by city boundaries, freeways, or other constructed landmarks. For example, Downtown Los Angeles is the area of Los Angeles roughly enclosed by three freeways and one river: the Harbor Freeway (SR 110) to the west, the Santa Ana Freeway (US 101) to the north, the Los Angeles River to the east, and the Santa Monica Freeway (I-10) to the south. Meanwhile, the San Fernando Valley (\"The Valley\") is defined as the basin consisting of the part of Los Angeles and its suburbs that lie north-northwest of downtown and is ringed by mountains.\n\nEdge cities in Los Angeles County\nCentral and Western area\nBeverly Hills\/Century City\nLAX\/El Segundo\nMarina Del Rey\/Culver City\nWest Los Angeles\nMid-Wilshire\nMiracle Mile\n\nSan Fernando Valley\nBurbank\/North Hollywood\nSherman Oaks\/Van Nuys, Los Angeles\nWarner Center, Los Angeles\/West Valley\n\nElsewhere in Los Angeles County\nPasadena\nSouth Bay\/Torrance\/Carson\nSouth Valley\/Covina (emerging edge city as of 1991)\nSanta Clarita (emerging edge city as of 1991)\n\nCities in Los Angeles County\nWith a population of nearly 4.1 million people at the 2020 census, the City of Los Angeles is the second most populous city in the United States after New York City, and is the focal point of the Greater Los Angeles Area. As an international center for finance, entertainment, media, culture, education, tourism, and science, Los Angeles is considered one of the world's most powerful and influential global cities.\nList of the 88 cities of Los Angeles County and six large CDPs by population at the 2020 U.S. census:\n\nOrange County\nOrange County was originally an agricultural area dependent on citrus crops, avocados, and oil extraction, and became a bedroom community for Los Angeles when I\u20135, the Santa Ana Freeway, linked it to the city in the 1950s. The growth of Los Angeles initially fueled population growth in Orange County, but by the 1970s it had become an important economic center in its own right, with tourism and electronics industries, among others. Today, Orange County is known for its tourist attractions, such as Disneyland, Knott's Berry Farm, its several pristine beaches and coastline, and its wealthier areas, featured in television shows such as The O.C. None of the original downtowns serves as the central urban core for the county, but there are important clusters of business and culture in Downtown Santa Ana and in three edge cities: the Anaheim\u2013Santa Ana edge city from Disneyland to the Orange Crush interchange (Orange, Santa Ana), the South Coast Plaza\u2013John Wayne Airport edge city (Santa Ana, Costa Mesa, Irvine), and Irvine's Spectrum edge city.\n\nOrange County is sometimes figuratively divided into \"North County\" and \"South County\", with North Orange County including cities such as Anaheim, Fullerton, and Santa Ana, and is the older, more ethnically diverse and more densely built-up area closer to Los Angeles. South County, defined variously as beginning with either Costa Mesa or Irvine and includes cities to the east and south such as Laguna Beach, Mission Viejo, Newport Beach, and San Clemente, is more residential, affluent, recently developed, and has a mostly white population. Irvine is an exception, as it is a center of employment and is ethnically diverse. A growing alternative dividing marker between north and south is the El Toro Y interchange. Orange Coast or South Coast area is defined instead as consisting of some or all of the cities lining the coast.\n\nSubregions in Orange County\nNorth Orange County\nSouth Orange County\n\nEdge cities in Orange County\nAnaheim\u2013Santa Ana edge city\nFullerton\/La Habra\/Brea (emerging edge city as of 1991)\nIrvine Spectrum\nNewport Center\/Fashion Island (emerging edge city as of 1991)\nSan Clemente\/Laguna Niguel (emerging edge city as of 1991)\nSouth Coast Plaza\u2013John Wayne Airport edge city\nWestminster\/Huntington Beach\n\nCities in Orange County\nList of the 34 cities in Orange County by population at the 2020 census:\n\nInland Empire\nThe Inland Empire, consisting of San Bernardino and Riverside Counties, contains fast-growing suburbs of the region, with a large to majority percentage of the working population commuting to either Los Angeles or Orange Counties for work. Originally an important center for citrus production, the region became an important industrial area by the early 20th century. The Inland Empire also became a key transportation center following the completion of Route 66, and later Interstate 10. With the post-World War II economic boom leading to rapid development in Los Angeles and Orange Counties, land developers bulldozed acres of agricultural land to build suburbs in order to accommodate the Los Angeles area's expanding population. The development of a regional freeway system facilitated the expansion of suburbs and human migration linking the Inland Empire and rest of Greater Los Angeles. Despite being primarily suburban, the Inland Empire is also home to important warehousing, shipping, logistics and retail industries, centered on the subregion's major cities of Riverside, San Bernardino and Ontario.\nWhile the Inland Empire is sometimes defined as the entirety of San Bernardino and Riverside Counties, the eastern undeveloped, desert portions of these counties are not considered to be part of Greater Los Angeles. The state of California defines this area to include the cities of Adelanto, Apple Valley, and Victorville to the north, the Riverside\u2013San Diego county line to the south, and the towns of Anza, Idyllwild, and Lucerne Valley, along with the San Bernardino National Forest to the east.\nAdditionally, the southwest portion of Riverside County, centered on the city of Temecula is more economically linked to San Diego county, with its growth largely being driven by migrants from San Diego seeking more affordable housing similar to how northwestern Riverside county's growth was driven by migrants from Orange County and Los Angeles seeking more affordable housing.\nHowever, with clear northern and southern limits to expansion, the region's urban eastern boundaries have become increasingly nebulous as suburban sprawl continues to spread out to form a unified whole with Los Angeles, with further development encroaching past the San Bernardino and San Jacinto Mountains and into the outlying desert areas. As a result, the regional definition of Greater Los Angeles can now be extended to include Barstow and surrounding towns in the northeast, the Morongo Basin in the east-central including Yucca Valley and Twentynine Palms, and the Coachella Valley cities in the southeast. This interconnectivity, provided by one of the most extensive freeway systems in the world, as well as economic, social and media ties, has blended boundaries between these regions and the urbanized Los Angeles and Inland Empire areas.\n\nSubregions in the Inland Empire\nHigh Desert (includes Antelope Valley in Los Angeles County plus Victor Valley and Morongo Basin)\nLow Desert (Coachella Valley, Palm Springs and Palm Desert area)\nSan Bernardino Mountains (Lake Arrowhead and Big Bear Lake area)\nNorthwest Riverside County (Corona, Norco, Jurupa Valley, and Riverside area)\nMoreno Valley (Moreno Valley and Perris)\nPomona Valley (Pomona, Rancho Cucamonga, Chino, Eastvale, Upland, Claremont, Montclair, La Verne and Ontario area. Partially in Los Angeles County)\nSan Bernardino Valley (San Bernardino, Fontana, Rialto, Colton, Loma Linda, Highland, and Redlands area)\nSan Gorgonio Pass (Banning, Yucaipa, Calimesa, and Beaumont area)\nSan Jacinto Valley (Hemet and San Jacinto area)\nTemecula Valley (Lake Elsinore, Menifee, Murrieta, Wildomar, and Temecula area)\n\nEdge cities in the Inland Empire\nOntario Airport\/Rancho Cucamonga\nRiverside (emerging edge city as of 1991)\nSan Bernardino (emerging edge city as of 1991)\n\nCities in Riverside County\nList of the 28 cities of Riverside County by population at the 2020 U.S. census:\n\nCities and towns in San Bernardino County\nList of the 24 cities and incorporated towns of San Bernardino County by population at the 2020 U.S. census:\n\nSparsely populated areas in the Inland Empire\nWhile the above areas are included in the regional definition of Greater Los Angeles, the U.S. Census Bureau defines Greater Los Angeles, or officially, the Los Angeles\u2013Long Beach Combined Statistical Area, to include both the above-mentioned areas along with the entirety of San Bernardino and Riverside counties. These areas are sparsely developed and are part of the Mojave and Colorado Deserts. To the north, Interstate 15 crosses desolate desert landscape after passing Barstow, linking Greater Los Angeles with Las Vegas, with Baker being the only significant outpost along the route. To the east, lie the Mojave National Preserve and Joshua Tree National Park along with the towns of Needles and Blythe on the California-Arizona border.\n\nVentura County\nVentura County is mostly suburban and rural and also has developed primarily through the growth of Los Angeles. Central and southern Ventura County formerly consisted of small towns along the Pacific Coast until the expansion of U.S. Route 101 drew in commuters from the San Fernando Valley. Master-planned cities soon began developing, and the county became increasingly urbanized. The northern part of the county, however, remains largely undeveloped and is mostly within the Los Padres National Forest.\n\nSubregions in Ventura County\nConejo Valley\nOxnard Plain\n\nEdge cities in Ventura County\nVentura\/Coastal Plain (emerging edge city as of 1991)\n\nCities in Ventura County\nList of the 10 cities of Ventura County by population at the 2020 U.S. census:\n\nUrban areas within\nAt the core of the Los Angeles\u2013Long Beach combined statistical area (CSA) lies the Los Angeles\u2013Long Beach\u2013Anaheim, CA urban area, the second most populous in the United States. Within the boundaries of the CSA the Census Bureau defines 30 other urban areas as well, two of which (Riverside\u2013San Bernardino and Oxnard\u2013Ventura) form the core of their own metropolitan areas separate from the Los Angeles metropolitan statistical area. Urban areas situated primarily outside the Los Angeles metropolitan statistical area but within the CSA are identified with a cross (\u2020) in the table below.\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the 2020 census, there were 18,644,680 people living in the Greater Los Angeles Area. The racial makeup of the area was 29.4% White (23.0% Non-Hispanic European and 6.4% Non-Hispanic Middle Eastern), 13.8% Asian (Non-Hispanic), 0.2% Pacific Islander (Non-Hispanic), 6.1% African American (Non-Hispanic), 0.2% Native American (Non-Hispanic), 0.5% from other races (Non-Hispanic), and 3.3% from two or more races (Non-Hispanic). 46.3% of the population were Hispanic of any race, a super-majority of which was of Mexican origin. 29.4% of the population (5.5 million) was foreign born; most immigrants came from Latin America and Asia.\nThe explosive growth of the region in the 20th century can be attributed to its favorable Mediterranean climate, the availability of land and many booming industries such as oil, automobile and rubber, motion pictures, intermodal, logistics, and aerospace which in turn attracted millions of people from all over the United States and world. Citrus production was important to the region's development in the earlier part of the 20th century.\n\nWhile the New York metropolitan area is presently the most populous metropolitan area in the United States, it has been predicted in the past that Greater Los Angeles will eventually surpass Greater New York in population. Whether this will happen is yet to be seen, but past predictions on this event have been off the mark. A 1966 article in Time predicted Greater Los Angeles would surpass New York by 1975, and that by 1990, would reach close to the 19 million mark. But the article's flawed definition of Greater Los Angeles included San Diego, which is actually its own metropolitan area. A 1989 article in The New York Times predicted Greater Los Angeles would surpass Greater New York by 2010, but the article predicted the population would be 18.3 million in that year, a number Greater New York already surpassed in 2007 by half a million people. By 2009, the New York metropolitan area had a population of 22.2 million compared to the Greater Los Angeles Area's 18.7 million, about a 3.56 million persons difference. Percentage growth, however, has been higher in Greater Los Angeles over the past few decades than in Greater New York.\n\nDemographics of Los Angeles and Orange counties\nAge and gender\nAccording to the 2009 American Community Survey, the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area had a population of 12,874,797, of which 6,402,498 (49.7% of the population) were male and 6,472,299 (50.3% of the population) were female. The age composition is shown in the table at right.\n\nMedian age: 34.6 years\n\nRace\nAccording to the 2020 census, there were 18,644,680 people living in the Greater Los Angeles Area. The racial makeup of the area was 29.4% White (23.0% Non-Hispanic European and 6.4% Non-Hispanic Middle Eastern), 13.8% Asian (Non-Hispanic), 0.2% Pacific Islander (Non-Hispanic), 6.1% African American (Non-Hispanic), 0.2% Native American (Non-Hispanic), 0.5% from other races (Non-Hispanic), and 3.3% from two or more races (Non-Hispanic). 46.3% of the population were Hispanic of any race, a super-majority of which was of Mexican origin.\n\nNon-Hispanic whites make up under one-third (29.4%) of the population, approximately 5,477,462 residents. The top European ancestries were German: 7.0% (1,301,202), English: 6.1% (1,131,426), Irish: 5.4% (1,002,233), Italian: 3.4% (624,585), Scandinavian: 2.2% (405,887), French: 1.5% (284,180), Scottish: 1.4% (264,429), Polish: 1.2% (224,443), and Russian: 1.0% (189,115). The top Middle Eastern ancestries were Jewish: 3.2% (600,000), Armenian: 1.2% (214.190), Arab: 0.98% (182,934), and Iranian: 0.75% (139,632). Additionally, 3.3% (611,193) of residents identified as simply American. Values may add to over 100% because people can identify with more than one ethnicity.\nApproximately 2,577,706 residents are Asian of non-Hispanic origin. Asians of non-Hispanic origin make up 13.8% of the population, about 1.4% South Asian (Indian Subcontinent), and about 12.4% were East or Southeast Asian. The six largest Asian ancestries with respect to all of Greater LA's population were Chinese: ~ 6.1% , Filipino: ~ 3.1%, Vietnamese: ~ 2.0%, Korean ~ 1.9%, Indian ~ 1.1% , and Japanese ~ 0.8%. Other important Asian American groups include Cambodian, Laotian, Hmong, Taiwanese, Pakistani, and Thai Americans.\nNon-Hispanic blacks make up 6.1% of the population. Approximately 1,143,781 residents are non-Hispanic blacks. Sub-Saharan Africans were 0.7% (137,443) and Non-Hispanic Caribbean Blacks were 0.3% (62,419).\nNon-Hispanic Native Americans make up 0.2% of the population (46,143).\nNon-Hispanic Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders make up 0.2% of the population. Approximately 42,591 residents are Native Hawaiian or of other Pacific Islander ancestries. The largest Pacific Islander ancestries were Samoan, Native Hawaiian, and Guamanian or Chamorro, and Tongan\nNon-Hispanic Multiracial people make up 3.3% of the population. Approximately 624,473 people are non-Hispanic multiracial.\nPeople who listed \"other\" as their race made up 0.5% (102,434) of the population.\nSource: data.census.gov. Retrieved on April 15, 2023.\n\nHispanic or Latino origin\nHispanic or Latinos, who may be of any race, are by far the largest group; Hispanics or Latinos make up 46.3% of the population. They outnumber every other racial group. Approximately 8,630,090 residents are Hispanic or Latino. The largest Hispanic or Latino ancestry was by far Mexican, with other important groups being Salvadoran, Guatemalan, Honduran, Peruvian,  Puerto Rican, Colombian, and Cuban.\n\nEthnic enclaves\nEthnic enclaves like Chinatown, the Byzantine-Latino Quarter, Historic Filipinotown, Little Saigon, Little Armenia, Little Ethiopia, Little Bangladesh,  Little Moscow (in Hollywood), Little Tokyo, Croatian Place and Via Italia in San Pedro, several Koreatowns, Tehrangeles in West Los Angeles, the Chinese enclaves in the San Gabriel Valley and Thai Town provide examples of the polyglot multicultural character of Los Angeles. Below is a list of many ethnic enclaves present in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.\n\nPolitics\nGreater Los Angeles is a politically divided metropolitan area. During the 1970s and 1980s, the region leaned toward the Republican Party. Los Angeles County, the most populous of the region, is a Democratic stronghold, although it voted twice for both Richard Nixon (1968 and 1972) and Ronald Reagan (1980 and 1984). Riverside County, San Bernardino County, and Orange County have historically leaned toward the Republican Party but have started shifting leftward in recent years. Ventura County is politically divided.\n\nEconomy\nThe Los Angeles metropolitan area has the third-largest metropolitan economy in the world, behind the Greater Tokyo Area and the New York metropolitan area. In 2022, the combined statistical area of Greater Los Angeles (which includes the Los Angeles metropolitan area, the Inland Empire, and Ventura County) had a $1.528 trillion economy.\nLos Angeles and Orange Counties together have an economy of roughly $1.227 trillion. Important are coastal California land values and the rents they command, which contribute heavily to GDP earnings, though there are worries that these high land values contribute to the long-term problem of housing affordability and are thus a possible risk to future GDP increase. This is evident when comparing the coast with the Inland Empire, a large component of the five-county combined statistical area (CSA) that nevertheless contributes a far smaller portion to regional gross metropolitan product but still dominates in industry. The Greater Los Angeles CSA is the third-largest economic center in the world, after Greater Tokyo and the New York-Newark-Bridgeport CSA.\nGreater Los Angeles is a hotspot for Asian car manufacturers. Specifically, Mitsubishi, Hyundai, Honda, and Mazda have their U.S. headquarters in the area. Nissan and Toyota were headquartered in the area in the recent past as well. (Nissan moved to Tennessee; Toyota moved to Texas.)\n\nThe economy of the Los Angeles metropolitan area is famously and heavily based on the entertainment industry, with a particular focus on television, motion pictures, interactive games, and recorded music \u2013 the Hollywood district of Los Angeles and its surrounding areas are known as the \"movie capital of the United States\" due to the region's extreme commercial and historical importance to the American motion picture industry. Other significant sectors include shipping\/international trade \u2013 particularly at the adjacent Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach, together comprising the United States' busiest seaport \u2013 logistics \u2013 the Inland Empire being the largest concentration of warehousing and intermodal facilities in the world \u2013 as well as aerospace, technology, petroleum, fashion and apparel, and tourism.\nThe City of Los Angeles is home to five Fortune 500 companies: energy company Occidental Petroleum (until 2014 when it moved its headquarters to Houston), healthcare provider Health Net, metals distributor Reliance Steel & Aluminum, engineering firm AECOM, and real estate group CB Richard Ellis. Other companies headquartered in Los Angeles include American Apparel, City National Bank, 20th Century Studios, Latham & Watkins, Univision, Metro Interactive, LLC, Premier America, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, DeviantArt, Guess?, O'Melveny & Myers; Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker, Tokyopop, The Jim Henson Company, Paramount Pictures, Sunkist Growers, Incorporated, Tutor Perini, Fox Sports Net, Capital Group, and The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf. Korean Air's US passenger and cargo operations headquarters are in two separate offices in Los Angeles. Entertainment and media giant The Walt Disney Company is headquartered in nearby Burbank.\n\n The Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach together comprise the fifth-busiest port in the world, being the center of imports and exports for trade on the west Pacific Coast as well as being one of the most significant ports of the western hemisphere. The Port of Los Angeles occupies 7,500 acres (3,035 hectares) of land and water along 43 miles (69 kilometres) of waterfront and is the busiest container port in the United States. The Port is the busiest port in the United States by container volume, the 8th busiest container port in the world. The top trading partners in 2004 were: China ($68.8 billion), Japan ($24.1 billion), Taiwan ($10.8 billion), Thailand ($6.7 billion), & South Korea ($5.6 billion)\nThe Port of Long Beach is the second-busiest container port in the United States. It adjoins the separate Port of Los Angeles. Acting as a major gateway for U.S.-Asian trade, the port occupies 3,200 acres (1,295 hectares) of land with 25 miles (40 kilometres) of waterfront in the city of Long Beach, California. The seaport has approximately $100 billion in trade and provides more than 316,000 jobs in Southern California. The Port of Long Beach imports and exports more than $100 billion worth of goods every year. The seaport provides the country with jobs, generates tax revenue, and supports retail and manufacturing businesses.\n\nEconomic statistics for Los Angeles and Orange Counties\nIn 2014, the population of the Long Beach\u2013Los Angeles\u2013Anaheim metropolitan statistical area (MSA) reached 13,262,220 and ranked second in the United States \u2013 a 1 percent increase from 2013. In 2014, Los Angeles\u2013Long Beach\u2013Anaheim had a per capita personal income (PCPI) of $50,751 and ranked 29th in the country.\nIn 2014, Los Angeles\u2013Long Beach\u2013Anaheim placed third among the largest exporters in the United States (shipment totaling to $75.5 billion). The metro accounted for 40.8 percent of California's merchandise exports, mainly exporting computer and electronic products ($18.6 billion); transportation equipment ($15.3 billion) and chemicals ($5.6 billion). Nonetheless, the greater Los Angeles metro has immensely benefited from the free trade agreements: greater Los Angeles exported $25.1 billion to the NAFTA region and $776 million in goods to the CAFTA region.\nOverall, in 2014 the average wages and salaries reached $57,519 (in 2010, the average wages and salaries reached $54,729). Meanwhile, the median household income in 2014 was $56,935, a 1.4 percent increase from 2013 (average median household income was $56,164).\nNote: Dollar items are in current dollars (not adjusted for inflation). Per capita items in dollars; other dollar items in thousands of dollars.\nTable 2 (refer below) is a chart of the four highest sectors in the metro area, with health care and social assistance reaching 15.54%.\n\nTable 3 (refer below) displays the location quotient for employment in the Los Angeles\u2013Long Beach\u2013Anaheim MSA. Top three sectors include information; art, entertainment, and recreation; and real estate and rental and leasing. (Data obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2014. Data measures Location Quotient for sectors in the MSA area. U.S. Total is the base areas.)\n\nUtilities and infrastructure\nThere are nine electric utility power companies in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.

The University of Southern California and University of California, Los Angeles, are among the largest, and the Claremont Colleges and California Institute of Technology are among the most academically renowned. Below is a list of some of the most well known colleges and universities within the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area.\n\nTransportation\nGreater Los Angeles is known for its expansive transportation network. Most notable is its extensive highway system. The area is a junction for numerous interstates coming from the north, east, and south and contains the three principal north\u2013south highways in California: Interstate 5, U.S. Route 101, and California State Route 1. The area is also home to several ports, including the twin ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, which are the two busiest in the United States, as well as Port of Hueneme. Additionally, the region is also served by the Los Angeles Metro Rail and Metrolink commuter rail systems that link neighborhoods of Los Angeles with immediate surrounding suburbs and most of the region (excluding the outer region of the Inland Empire) with Oceanside in San Diego County, respectively. Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) is the principal international airport of the region and is one of the busiest in the world. Other airports include Ontario International Airport (ONT), John Wayne Airport (SNA), Bob Hope Airport (BUR), Long Beach Municipal Airport (LGB), and Palm Springs International Airport (PSP).\n\nHistoric streetcar network\nThe Pacific Electric Railway Company, nicknamed the Red Cars, was a privately owned mass transit system in Southern California consisting of electrically powered streetcars, interurban cars, and buses and was the largest electric railway system in the world in the 1920s. Organized around the city centers of Los Angeles and San Bernardino, it connected cities in Los Angeles County, Orange County, San Bernardino County and Riverside County.\nThe system shared dual gauge track with the 3 ft 6 in (1,067 mm) narrow gauge Los Angeles Railway, \"Yellow Car\", or \"LARy\" system on Main Street in downtown Los Angeles (directly in front of the 6th and Main terminal), on 4th Street, and along Hawthorne Boulevard south of downtown Los Angeles toward the cities of Hawthorne, Gardena, and Torrance.\n\nCommercial airports\nThe primary airport serving the LA metro area is Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), one of the busiest airports in the United States. LAX is in southwestern Los Angeles, 16 miles (26 km) from Downtown Los Angeles. LAX is the only airport to serve as a hub for all three U.S. legacy airlines \u2014American, Delta and United.\nIn addition to LAX, other airports, including Hollywood Burbank Airport, John Wayne Airport, Long Beach Airport, Ontario International Airport, and San Bernardino International Airport also serve the region.\n\nBridges\nThe Los Angeles metropolitan area has only one suspension bridge: Vincent Thomas Bridge in San Pedro, and one cable-stayed bridge: Long Beach International Gateway in Long Beach.\n\nInterstate Highways\nGolden State Freeway\/Santa Ana Freeway\/San Diego Freeway (Interstate 5)\n Santa Monica Freeway\/Rosa Parks Freeway\/San Bernardino Freeway (Interstate 10)\n Escondido Freeway\/Temecula Valley Freeway\/Corona Freeway\/Ontario Freeway\/Mojave Freeway (Interstate 15)\n Glenn Anderson Freeway\/Century Freeway (Interstate 105)\n Harbor Freeway (Interstate 110)\n Foothill Freeway (Interstate 210)\n Escondido Freeway\/Armed Forces Freeway\/Barstow Freeway (Interstate 215)\n San Diego Freeway (Interstate 405)\n San Gabriel River Freeway (Interstate 605)\n Long Beach Freeway (Interstate 710)\n\nU.S. Highways\nWill Rogers Highway (Former U.S. Route 66)\n Pacific Highway (Former U.S. Route 99)\n Santa Ana Freeway\/Hollywood Freeway (U.S. Route 101)\n\nCalifornia State Highways\nLos Angeles County Metro\nThe Los Angeles Metro Rail is the mass transit rail system of Los Angeles County. It is run by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority and its system runs six rail lines throughout Los Angeles County. Metro Rail currently operates four light rail and two rapid transit lines, altogether totaling 115.5 miles (185.9 km) of rail, 101 stations, and over 360,000 daily weekday boardings as of December 2012.\n\nThe A Line \u2013 light rail\nThe B Line \u2013 rapid transit\nThe C Line \u2013 light rail\nThe D Line \u2013 rapid transit\nThe E Line \u2013 light rail\nThe G Line \u2013 bus rapid transit\nThe J Line \u2013 bus rapid transit\nThe K Line \u2013 light rail\nThe system's light rail lines are the second busiest LRT system in the United States, after Boston, by number of riders, with 200,300 average weekday boardings during the third quarter of 2012. By 2019, it had become the most heavily ridden light rail system in the country.\nSince the region of the city is in close proximity to a major fault area the tunnels were built to resist earthquakes of up to magnitude 7.5. Both subway lines use an electrified third rail to provide power to the trains, rendering these lines unusable on the other three. The Blue and Gold Lines run mostly at grade, with some street-running, elevated, and underground stretches in the more densely populated areas of Los Angeles. The Green Line is entirely grade separated, running in the median of I-105 and then turning southward along an elevated route.\nThe rail lines run regularly on a 5 am and midnight schedule, seven days a week. Limited service on particular segments is provided after midnight and before 5 am There is no rail service between 2 and 3:30 am Exact times vary from route to route; see individual route articles for more information.\n\nOther authorities\nIn addition to Metro, other providers provide local service within their jurisdictions. These include the Orange County Transportation Authority, San Bernardino County Transportation Authority, and Riverside Transit Agency.\n\nRegional and commuter rail\nThere are two providers of heavy rail transportation in the region, Amtrak and Metrolink. Amtrak provides service to San Diego, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, and points in between on the Pacific Surfliner. It also provides long-distance routes, including the Coast Starlight which goes to the San Francisco Bay Area, Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington; the Southwest Chief which goes to Flagstaff, Arizona, Albuquerque, New Mexico, Kansas City, Missouri and Chicago; and the Sunset Limited which provides limited service (three days a week) to Tucson, El Paso, Houston, and New Orleans.\nMetrolink provides service to numerous places within Southern California, including all counties in the region. Metrolink operates to 67 stations on eight lines within Southern California which mostly (except for the Inland Empire\u2013Orange County Line and Arrow) radiate from Los Angeles Union Station.\n\nSports\nProfessional teams\nAs a whole, the Los Angeles area has more national championships, all sports combined (college and professional), than any other city in the United States, with over four times as many championships as the entire state of Texas, and just over twice that of New York City. It is the only American city to host the summer Olympic games twice: once in 1932, and more recently in 1984 (Lake Placid hosted the winter Olympic games twice: once in 1932 and once in 1980). Los Angeles will also be the host of the 2028 Summer Olympics, becoming the third city to host three Olympic Games, after London and Paris.\n\nTable of professional teams and venues\nOther professional venues include:\n\nAuto Club Raceway, Pomona\nAuto Club Speedway\nJohn C. Argue Swim Stadium\nLong Beach Marine Stadium\nLos Angeles Memorial Coliseum (Temporary)\nRose Bowl\nSanta Anita Park\nKia Forum\nVELO Sports Center\n\nNCAA Division I college sports\nCalifornia Baptist Lancers\nCal State Fullerton Titans\nCal State Northridge Matadors\nLong Beach State Beach\nLoyola Marymount Lions\nPepperdine Waves\nUC Irvine Anteaters\nUC Riverside Highlanders\nUCLA Bruins (FBS)\nUSC Trojans (FBS)\n\nOther sports\nThe Greater Los Angeles area also has three well-known horse racing facilities: Santa Anita Park, Los Alamitos Race Course and the former Hollywood Park Racetrack and three major motorsport venues: Auto Club Speedway, Long Beach street circuit, and Auto Club Raceway at Pomona. In addition, the city of Los Angeles hosted the Summer Olympics in 1932 and 1984.\nFor over twenty years the Los Angeles area media market lacked a National Football League team. After the 1994 season, the Los Angeles Rams moved to St. Louis, Missouri, and the Los Angeles Raiders returned to their original home of Oakland, California, due to the lack of an up-to-date NFL stadium. After numerous stadium proposals between 1995 and 2016 in an attempt to bring the NFL back, the Oakland Raiders, St. Louis Rams, and San Diego Chargers all submitted plans to relocate back to Los Angeles after the 2015 NFL season. On January 12, 2016, the Rams were approved to move to Los Angeles and build the venue eventually known as SoFi Stadium with the Chargers or Raiders given the option to join them. On January 12, 2017, the Chargers announced their move to Los Angeles to join the Rams. Both teams share SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California.\n\nSee also\n\n Media related to Greater Los Angeles Area at Wikimedia Commons\nCalifornia megapolitan areas\nList of hotels in Los Angeles\nList of metropolitan areas in the Americas\n\n\n== References ==","144":"This article covers streets in Los Angeles between and including 1st Street and 10th Street.

The neighborhood is named after the Feliz family of Californios who had owned the area since 1795, when Jos\u00e9 Vicente F\u00e9liz was granted Rancho Los Feliz.\n\nHistory\nIndigenous era\nLong before the Spanish settlers arrived to settle near the banks of the Los Angeles River, Native Americans were the only inhabitants. It is estimated that the first Native Americans came to the area approximately 10,000 years ago. The Native Americans established villages, throughout the countryside. One of these settlements was within the boundaries of what was to become Rancho Los Feliz. Archeological surveys have found evidence of a substantial rancheria that existed in the mouth of Fern Dell Canyon in Griffith Park. The traditional name of this village is not known, but the inhabitants were Tongva. The name Gabriele\u00f1os was given to these people by the Spanish because of the Native Americans' association with the San Gabriel Mission.\n\nSpanish and Mexican eras\nWhen Gaspar de Portol\u00e0 traveled through the vicinity in 1769, his expedition encountered members of this village.\nThe 6,647-acre (27 km2) Rancho Los Feliz, one of the first land grants in California, was granted to Corporal Jos\u00e9 Vicente Feliz. An old adobe house built in the 1830s by his heirs still stands on Crystal Springs Drive in Griffith Park. Other sections of the rancho were developed and became the communities of Los Feliz and Silver Lake.\n\nPost-Conquest era\nFollowing the American conquest of California, Rancho Los Feliz had a succession of owners after the Feliz family. The family first sold the rancho to noted statesman Antonio F. Coronel, before it passed to James Lick, whose estate sold the rancho to Griffith J. Griffith. Griffith donated over half of the ranch to the city of Los Angeles. This ranch became one of the largest city-owned parks in the country, Griffith Park.\nIn 1882, Colonel Griffith acquired 4,071 acres (16 km2) of Rancho Los Feliz. The Lick estate still owned the southwest portion of the rancho and there developed the Lick Tract, which later became a part of Hollywood. Griffith never served in any branch of the U.S. armed forces, but he was given the honorary title of colonel by influential friends in the California National Guard. The title remained a permanent fixture to his name.\n\nModern era\nIn 1900, there were only 23 properties in Los Feliz.\nGriffith died on July 6, 1919, at the age of 67. Griffith bequeathed $700,000 and his Los Feliz acreage to the city of Los Angeles to be used for additions to Griffith Park.\nOn August 9, 1969, Manson and six others murdered supermarket executive Leno LaBianca and his wife Rosemary in their home located at 3301 Waverly Drive in Los Feliz, henceforth known as the Tate\u2013LaBianca murders.:\u200a176\u2013184,\u200a258\u2013269\u200a \nOn May 8\u20139, 2007, about 800 acres (3.2 km2) of uninhabited terrain in Los Feliz and Griffith Park, including the famous Dante's View, were destroyed in a wildfire. After the fire, Los Angeles city officials pledged millions of dollars in aid to repair the damage.\n\nGeography\nLos Feliz encompasses several smaller but distinct areas, including the Los Feliz Hills and Los Feliz Estates (north of Los Feliz Boulevard), Laughlin Park, Los Feliz Village, Los Feliz Square, Los Feliz Knolls, and Franklin Hills.\nAccording to the Mapping L.A. project of the Los Angeles Times, Los Feliz is part of central Los Angeles. It is flanked on the north by Griffith Park, on the northeast by Atwater Village, on the southeast by Silver Lake, on the south by East Hollywood, and on the northwest by Hollywood and Hollywood Hills. Los Feliz is situated near the 101 and the 5 freeways in Hollywood and Atwater Village respectively. The neighborhood's boundaries (as used by Mapping L.A.) are the Griffith Park line between Fern Dell Drive and Riverside Drive on the north; the Los Angeles River on the east; Hyperion Avenue and Griffith Park Boulevard on the southeast; Fountain Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard on the south; and Western Avenue, Los Feliz Boulevard, and Fern Dell Drive on the west and northwest. The boundaries of the Los Feliz Improvement Association extend further west to Canyon Drive.\nLos Feliz experiences a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Csa), just like most of Central Los Angeles.\n\nDemographics\nThe 2000 U.S. census counted 35,238 residents in the 2.61-square-mile neighborhood\u2014an average of 13,512 people per square mile, among the highest population densities in Los Angeles County. In 2008 the city estimated that the population had increased to 36,933. The median age for residents was 36, older than in the city as a whole; the percentage of residents aged 65 and older was among the county's highest.\nThe neighborhood was highly diverse ethnically. The breakdown was whites, 57.6%; Latinos, 18.7%; Asians, 13.5%; blacks, 3.7%, and others, 6.6%. Armenia (25.3%) and Mexico (9.4%) were the most common places of birth for the 44.5% of the residents who were born abroad, a high ratio compared to the rest of Los Angeles.\nThe median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $50,793, about the same as the rest of Los Angeles, but a high rate of households earned $20,000 or less per year. The average household size of two people was low for the city of Los Angeles. Renters occupied 75.5% of the housing stock, and house or apartment owners the rest.\nThe percentages of never-married men (50.2%) and never-married women (37.2%) were among the county's highest, as was the percentage of widowed women (10.1%).\n\nCommunities\nThe Los Feliz Neighborhood Council is divided into six interest areas, which include the following communities:\n\nDistrict A: Los Feliz Hills and Los Feliz Estates\nDistrict B: Los Feliz Square, Laughlin Park, and Thai Town North\nDistrict C: Los Feliz Village\nDistrict D: Los Feliz Knolls and Waverly Heights\nDistrict E: Franklin Hills and a few neighboring blocks\nDistrict F: West Los Feliz\nThe Oaks, a hilly neighborhood on the west side of Los Feliz bordering Griffith Park, is part of the Hollywood United Neighborhood Council. It is, however, within the boundaries of the Los Feliz Improvement Association.\n\nLos Feliz Hills\nThe area north of Los Feliz Boulevard below Griffith Park is commonly referred to as the Los Feliz Hills. The Los Feliz Hills contain multimillion-dollar homes and have been known for the large share of their inhabitants being involved in creative pursuits. The mean household income is $196,585.\nThe original subdivision of Los Feliz Heights was subdivided in 1921, from Los Feliz Boulevard north to Griffith Park, from Catalina to Vermont. The Los Feliz Heights Residential Historic District is significant for Period Revival architecture (including American Colonial, Spanish Colonial, Mediterranean, and Tudor Revival styles) from 1920 to 1949. The original subdivision of Hillhurst Park was between Los Feliz Boulevard and Griffith Park, from Vermont Avenue to Commonwealth Avenue. The original subdivision of Los Feliz Hills was to the east, abutting Riverside Drive, Los Feliz Boulevard, and Griffith Park.\n\nLaughlin Park\nThe gated community of Laughlin Park has 60 houses. In 1998, Laura Meyers of Los Angeles Magazine described the area as \"The most seductive, exclusive neighborhood in Los Feliz\". W.C. Fields lived here in an Italianate residence built in 1919.\n\nLos Feliz Village\nLos Feliz Village is the southern section of Los Feliz, home to most of the commercial storefronts in the district. It is centered on the thoroughfares of Vermont and Hillhurst Avenues and spans from approximately Prospect Avenue to Los Feliz Boulevard.

It is the primary thoroughfare of the Los Feliz neighborhood. It starts off at its easternmost point at Glendale Avenue in Glendale as Los Feliz Road. After passing the Metrolink railroad tracks in western Glendale, it enters Los Angeles and becomes Los Feliz Boulevard.\nLos Feliz passes through Atwater Village and serves as the demarcation of the south east corner of Griffith Park.  It is exit 141 off the Golden State Freeway.  From there it generally parallels the southern border of Griffith Park, offset by a couple of residential blocks.  After Griffith Park, at the American Film Institute Conservatory, it swerves to a north-south street and ends. It then merges and becomes Western Avenue, which runs all the way down to its southern terminus near the tide pools in the San Pedro area.  Going north on Vermont Avenue leads to the Greek Theatre and Griffith Observatory.\n\nNotable landmarks\nGriffith Park\nPhilosophical Research Society\n\nTransportation\nThe following lines operate on Los Feliz Boulevard:\n\nMetro Local lines 180 headed for Hollywood and Pasadena.\nDASH Los Feliz runs on Los Feliz boulevard between Vermont and Hillhurst and connects to the Metro B Line subway service at Sunset and Vermont.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Los Feliz Boulevard (Los Angeles) at Wikimedia Commons","148":"Brentwood is a suburban neighborhood in the Westside region of Los Angeles.\n\nHistory\nGeneral\nModern development began after the establishment of the 600-acre (2.4 km2) Pacific Branch of the National Home for Disabled Soldiers and Sailors in the 1880s. A small community sprang up outside that facility's west gate, taking on the name Westgate. Annexed by the City of Los Angeles on June 14, 1916, Westgate's 49 sq mi (130 km2) included large parts of what is now the Pacific Palisades and a small portion of today's Bel-Air. Westgate Avenue is one of the last reminders of that namesake.\n\nLocal traditions include a Maypole erected each year on the lawn of the Archer School for Girls, carrying on that set by the Eastern Star Home previously housed there. This building was the exterior establishing shot for the \"Mar Vista Rest Home\" that provided a key scene in the 1974 film Chinatown.\n\nVery High Fire Hazard Severity Zone designation\nThe State Cal-Fire Authority officially designated Brentwood, from Mulholland down to Sunset Boulevard, a Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone, due to the long, uninterrupted border of urban-wildlife interface in the hillsides that has resulted in multiple fires over many years, destroying entire neighborhoods and requiring numerous evacuations. For this reason, the Brentwood community has been strongly in favor of halting all further development in the hillside and canyon areas.\nOn November 6, 1961, a construction crew working in Sherman Oaks in the San Fernando Valley north of Brentwood on the far side of the Santa Monica Mountains noticed smoke and flames in a nearby pile of rubbish. Within minutes, Santa Ana winds gusting up to 60 mph (100 km\/h) sent burning brush aloft and over the ridge into Brentwood.\nMore than 300 police officers helped evacuate 3,500 residents during the 12-hour fire, and some 2,500 firefighters battled the blaze, pumping water from neighborhood swimming pools to douse flames. Pockets of the fire smoldered for several days. Even as firefighters battled what was to become a Bel Air disaster, another fire erupted in Santa Ynez Canyon to the west. That blaze was contained the next day after consuming nearly 10,000 acres (40 km2) and nine structures and burning to within a mile of Bel Air and Brentwood. The fires were the fifth-worst conflagration in the nation's history at the time, burning 16,090 acres (65 km2), destroying more than 484 homes and 190 other structures and causing an estimated $30 million in damage.\n\nO. J. Simpson murder case\nBrentwood was the site of the 1994 stabbing deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, outside Nicole Brown Simpson's Bundy Drive townhouse. Nicole's ex-husband, football player and actor O. J. Simpson, was acquitted of the murders, but was later found liable for the deaths in a civil trial. O. J. Simpson's Brentwood home was subsequently sold. The new owners demolished Simpson's home and built a new residence.\n\nGeography\nBoundaries\nThe district is located at the base of the Santa Monica Mountains, bounded by the San Diego Freeway on the east, Wilshire Boulevard on the south, the Santa Monica city limits on the southwest, Sullivan Canyon\/Westridge Trail on the west and Mulholland Drive on the north.\n\nEnvironment\nBrentwood, like nearby Santa Monica, has a temperate climate influenced by marine breezes off the Pacific Ocean. Residents frequently wake to a \"marine layer\", a cover of clouds brought in at night which burns off by mid-morning. The topography is generally split into two characters, broadly divided by Sunset Boulevard: the area north of Sunset is defined by ridges and canyons of the Santa Monica Mountains and is located in a Cal-Fire designated Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone; south of Sunset the area is mostly flat. The area South of San Vicente features an underground spring which bubbles up into a small creek along \"the Gully\" near the Brentwood Country Club.\n\nDemographics\nThe 2000 U.S. census counted 31,344 residents in the 15.22-square-mile Brentwood neighborhood\u2014or 2,059 people per square mile. In 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 33,312.\nThe population was 84.2% Non-Hispanic White, 6.5% Asian American, 4.5% Hispanic or Latino, 1.2% African American, and 3.6% of other origins. Iran (27.2%) and the United Kingdom (4.8%) were the most common places of birth for the 21.1% of the residents who were born abroad\u2014which was a low percentage for Los Angeles as a whole. The median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $112,927, high for the city of Los Angeles as well as the county.\n\nNotable sights\nSan Vicente Boulevard is divided by a wide median on which stand many large coral trees. This green belt replaced a Pacific Electric trolley track, and the trees have been named a City of Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument.\nBrentwood features a number of residential sub-districts:\n\nBrentwood Circle: a gated community east of Barrington and north of Sunset that was created when the Getty Museum was built.\nBrentwood Glen: an area bounded by Sunset, the 405 Freeway, and the Veterans Administration, it is an enclave of small lots and single family homes\nBundy Canyon: home to Mount St. Mary's College and an emergency ingress entrance to Getty Center (though the latter is accessible only from Sepulveda for the public)\nCrestwood Hills: includes a cluster of protected, architecturally significant mid-century modern residences located in the northern part of Kenter Canyon\nMandeville Canyon: westernmost part of Brentwood, north of Sunset; extends about three miles to the north and is the longest dead end street in the City of Los Angeles.\nSullivan Canyon: a mostly equestrian neighborhood with a private riding ring.\nThe \"Polo Field\": situated at Will Rogers State Park near Paul Revere Middle School and the Riviera Golf Club\nBrentwood Park: large estates located in a zone bordered by Oakmont, San Vicente, Allenford and Cliffwood Drive.\nBrentwood Terrace: Located between the Brentwood Country Mart and Brentwood Country Club\nEach sub-district is represented by a different homeowners association.\n\nRecreation\nBrentwood's Barrington Recreation Center has an indoor gymnasium which converts into a small auditorium with a capacity of 250. Outdoors is a lighted baseball diamond, an unlighted baseball diamond, lighted indoor basketball courts, lighted outdoor basketball courts, a children's play area, picnic tables and lighted tennis courts. As of March 2018, Barrington Park received a grade of \"D\" from the Los Angeles Parks and Recreation Department due its poor facilities; upon investigation, the Brentwood Community Council discovered $1.1 million in missing funds that were supposed to be used for capital upgrades at the park and successfully fought the city for their return. With the funds back in place, the Community has worked to improve the park. The Barrington Dog Park is across the street from the recreation center and is part of Barrington Veterans Park, which is owned by the West LA VA and leased to the City of Los Angeles.\n\nEconomy and businesses\nThe vast majority of office space in Brentwood is rented to professional services firms: accountants, lawyers, medical care.\nThere are three upscale commercial areas: Brentwood Country Mart, Barrington Plaza and the San Vicente Business District, which include restaurants, clothing stores, and other high-end retailers.\nA few long time businesses should be noted: Brent-Air Pharmacy, run by the founding Lassoff family from its inception until June 2007, served Brentwood for more than 50 years. The drug store has been the scene of many famous scandals and, like its defunct West Hollywood cousin Schwab's, is known as the pharmacy to the stars, where many now-notable actors and actresses worked as delivery boys or \"candy counter\" girls.\nThe Brentwood Country Mart, near the corner of San Vicente Blvd and 26th Street next to the Santa Monica city limit, is a shopping and food center that first opened in 1948.\nVicente Foods is an independently owned and operated grocery market that has served Brentwood since 1948. Other local markets include Whole Foods and Ralphs.\nA popular area for dining and coffee for local residents is located in Brentwood Village at the intersection of Barrington and Sunset. More than a dozen restaurants and coffee shops are located within a two-block stretch offering a wide variety of cuisine.\nDutton's Brentwood Books, a local landmark called by Sunset magazine \"the last of the truly independent bookstores\", closed its doors in April 2008.\n\nGovernment and infrastructure\nBrentwood leadership and city services\nBrentwood and Pacific Palisades both chose to form community councils in order to have an independent voice with regard to issues that impact their communities, such as their joint Community Plan, which is a City approved document that governs the aesthetics of zoning and design for the neighborhoods. The Brentwood Community Council holds monthly public meetings, as does its Land Use Committee, and has been a powerful and effective voice for the community since the 1990s. The BCC Board includes members from all local HOA's, plus members representing schools, business, environment, transportation, civic affairs and a group dedicated only to residents under 40, called Brentwood '49. City Services are provided by the Los Angeles Fire Department Station 19 in Brentwood. The Los Angeles Police Department operates the West Los Angeles Community Police Station in West Los Angeles, serving Brentwood. The City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power provide utilities. All areas of Brentwood are served by a Residents Association of some kind.\n\nWest LA VA and VA Master Plan Redevelopment\nWhile the annual County of Los Angeles homeless count rarely attributes more than 50 persons as homeless in Brentwood, the majority of the homeless persons are Veterans. While the VA does have available beds and treatment programs, many Veterans find it hard to take the first step to accept VA assistance for a variety of reasons, including deep mistrust of the VA, dishonorable discharges that prevent them from receiving services, the mandatory sober living environment on the VA campus. The Brentwood Community Council took the lead in 2013 to help establish Veteran safe parking and safe camping programs, which allow Veterans to take an 'intermediate step\" between homelessness and accepting full VA assistance and these programs have been successful and have grown over time. Some Veterans believed the VA was derelict in its duty to provide housing and successfully sued the VA, proving that multiple leases of VA property had been used for fraudulent means. Several individuals went to prison, including a former VA executive. As a result of the settlement in the Veterans civil suit against the VA, the $1B VA Master Plan Redevelopment of the West LA VA property, including 2000+ units of housing, was approved by Congress in 2019 and was completed in late 2020.\n\nCounty\nThe Los Angeles County Department of Health Services SPA 5 West Area Health Office serves Brentwood. The Supervisor for this area is Lindsey Horvath.\n\nState\nBrentwood is represented in the California State Senate by Ben Allen and in the California State Assembly by Richard Bloom.\n\nFederal\nThe United States Postal Service operates the Barrington Post Office in Brentwood. Ted Lieu represents the area in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nEducation\nSeventy percent of Brentwood residents aged 25 and older had earned a four-year degree by 2000, a high percentage for the city and the county. The percentages of residents in that age range with a bachelor's degree or greater were high for the county.\n\nPrimary and secondary education\nSchools within the Brentwood borders are as follows:\nThe public elementary schools in the area are Kenter Canyon Elementary School (an LAUSD charter school) and Brentwood Science Magnet Elementary School (an LAUSD alternative school). Paul Revere Charter Middle School is Brentwood's public middle school. High school students are zoned to University High School in West Los Angeles, and Palisades Charter High School, in the nearby neighborhood of Pacific Palisades.\nThe following private schools are located in the Brentwood area:\n\nWestland School, elementary\nThe Mirman School\nBerkeley Hall School, elementary\nMilken Community High School\nBrentwood School, K\u201312\nArcher School for Girls\nSaint Martin of Tours School, elementary\n\nPublic libraries\nLos Angeles Public Library operates the Donald Bruce Kaufman - Brentwood Branch Library.\n\nNotable people\nSee also\nList of districts and neighborhoods in Los Angeles\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nBrentwood Community Council\nBrentwood Homeowners Association\nKenter Canyon Elementary School\nLos Angeles City Brentwood-Palisades area map\nSan Vicente Blvd. Brentwood\nBrentwood crime map and statistics","149":"Main Street is a major north\u2013south thoroughfare in Los Angeles, California.

The ground floor housed retail tenants such as Coulter's (1879\u20131884), George D. Rowan and Eugene Germain. The second floor was offices, and the third floor held the city's most upscale apartments. In 1919, Goodwill Industries bought the building and opened its store and operations. That is not to say though, that nobody fought to save the building. The Metropolitan Garden Association tried to move the Baker Block to another location for use as a public recreation center, while city councilman Arthur E. Briggs raised funds to convert the building into a city history museum. Nonetheless, in 1941, Goodwill sold the building to the city, which demolished it in 1942.

The Melrose Annexation was effective June 16, 1922. The area was 0.67 square miles, generally along Melrose Avenue, from Sweetzer Avenue on the west to June Street on the east.\n\nMelrose District\nThe eastern end of the district, which runs from Fairfax to Highland Avenue, became a popular underground and new wave shopping area in the early 1980s and a centerpoint for the new wave and punk subcultures. The avenue has appeared in various films and television shows, including Entourage, LA Ink, Melrose Place and the \"Jaywalking\" segments of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.\nMany stores and businesses have made their homes in the district, including Retail Slut and a large outdoor flea market called the Melrose Trading Post.

For decades, it was recognizable by the white, ladder-like snake on the building's roof. This work of art was called \"Starsteps\" and was dismantled when ownership of the building changed hands in 2000. It was one of the Los Angeles landmarks that had previous landmark status in the late 20th century.\n\nLandmark status\nMetromedia Square was one of the Los Angeles landmarks that had previous landmark status in the late 20th century, until demolition in the first couple of years in the 21st century; 14 years before the demolition of the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, another last Los Angeles landmark demolished to make way for the Banc of California Stadium in 2016. The lattice steel, truss-like sculpture on top of the building, \"Starsteps\" was what made Metromedia Square a Los Angeles landmark in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nHistory\nOrigins\nThe site was first known as the Nassour Studios, built in 1946 and opened January 1, 1947 by brothers William and Edward Nassour (1911\u20131962). Over 100 independent films were shot there under the Nassour Studios banner. Originally, there were four sound stages ranging in size from around 7,600 square feet (710 m2) to just over 13,000 square feet (1,200 m2). Nassour's modern Art Deco-styled projection room and modern offices were located in the buildings fronting Sunset Boulevard.\nDressing rooms were constructed adjacent to stages 1 and 2. An old converted two story apartment building located down the street on Van Ness housed producers and writers. The largest stage, stage 4, had removable panels that hid a water tank. It was used to film the jungle river scenes in 1949's Africa Screams. The lot was very small (about four acres) so an underground facility for storage was necessary. A large freight elevator was installed for access.\n\nA major television facility\nIn 1950, the Nassour brothers sold their studio to the Times Mirror Company, publisher of the Los Angeles Times. Times-Mirror was looking for a facility to permanently house KTTV (channel 11), its new television station (at the time, owned jointly with CBS) which commenced broadcasting the previous year.  The facility was later renamed KTTV Studios.\nThe New York City-based firm Metromedia purchased the property along with KTTV in 1963.  In 1967 Metromedia undertook an extensive renovation and expansion of the facility, which included renovating two of the existing studios, as well as a new office tower and building housing various Metromedia enterprises, including the Harlem Globetrotters, the Ice Capades, the Foster & Kleiser advertising firm and Wolper Productions, the latter of which was purchased by the company in 1964. The renovation also brought about a name change, from KTTV Studios to Metromedia Square.(also referred to as Metromedia West). Los Angeles radio stations KLAC and KMET (now KTWV), which Metromedia purchased in separate 1963 and 1965 transactions, moved there in 1976. \nIn 1975, further expansion was made, with the addition of a 40,000 square-foot building with offices, dressing rooms and rehearsal space, as well as more soundstage renovation (bringing the total to 5 altogether; by the time the facility was demolished, the studio count had increased to 6); 4 video editing bays were added by 1983. As a result of the increased work (as Metromedia expanded their production of programming for first-run syndication via their Metromedia Producers Corporation division, in addition to external clients, including Norman Lear's shows and production of television commercials), Metromedia established the MetroTape division to provide videotape and production services (functioning autonomously from their television and radio arms); accordingly, the Metromedia Square facilities became known under the alternate banner of MetroTape West. The truss-like, lattice steel work of art sculpture, \"Starsteps\" was added to the building's roof on the north side of the property above the 101 freeway in 1981. In 1982, a satellite uplink facility was created for use by the Satellite News Channel, a joint venture of Group W and ABC (with KTTV handling the production of regionalized news updates); after SNC's closure in 1983, the uplink was subsequently reused by SYNSAT, a joint venture of Group W Productions and Nolo Communications designed to streamline distribution of television and film programming.\nTelevision producer Norman Lear moved into the property in 1973 and headquartered his company, Tandem Productions, in the building. Lear started videotaping his television series here in the fall of 1975, including but not limited to: All in the Family; Diff'rent Strokes; The Jeffersons; Maude; Good Times; Hello, Larry; One Day at a Time; and The Facts of Life. One of his other shows, Sanford and Son, remained taped at NBC Studios in Burbank; its 1980 revival, Sanford, was videotaped at Metromedia. Shows such as Diff'rent Strokes, The Facts of Life, One Day at a Time, and The Jeffersons later relocated to Universal City Studios by 1982.\n\nLater years\nIn 1986, Metromedia sold most of its television interests to News Corporation, and KTTV became a cornerstone station of the new Fox Broadcasting Company.  As a result, the studios became the Fox Television Center, though Metromedia continued to own the building and the land on which it was situated, leasing the property to Fox and KTTV.\nThe Fox Broadcasting Company launch announcement was made from the property, and on October 9, 1986, the flagship show was broadcast live, The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers. Shows like the Metromedia and then Fox-produced Small Wonder and NBC's Saved by the Bell, as well as the direct-to-syndication seasons of Mama's Family, the sketch comedy series In Living Color, and the first season of MAD TV were among the later series to be taped at this complex. Ironically, very few Fox television shows were actually taped at the Fox Television Center; however, it did serve as the network's technical center, with all programming for Fox's prime-time and late-night lineups, as well as Fox Kids Network programming, being uplinked to satellite from here (with a brand-new uplink facility created in 1992, in part to handle news backhaul feeds for use by the network's affiliates). Uplinking was handled by the Fox Tape division, formerly MetroTape, which also uplinked syndicated programming from 20th Television.\nWhen Fox Sports began operations in 1994, studio programming such as Fox NFL Sunday began to originate from here, along with studio content for Fox Sports Net when that venture launched in 1996. To accommodate the vast infrastructure necessary for live sports programming, millions of dollars worth of new equipment and expansion to the Fox Television Center were necessary; this included a seventh studio exclusively for sports coverage, multiple new control rooms, the technology necessary to keep the \"Fox Box\" scorebox updated, Chyron graphics machines, and specialized recordable LaserDisc players.\nKTTV moved to their own new building (the present-day Fox Television Center) in West Los Angeles in 1996, which is the corporate home of the Fox Television Stations group. Meanwhile, the radio stations' studios remained there, even long after they were no longer owned by Metromedia. KTWV, now owned by Audacy, moved to new studios in Culver City in 1997, and then Miracle Mile neighborhood on L.A.'s Wilshire Boulevard on February 18, 2013. KLAC eventually became acquired by Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia) and moved to studios shared with Clear Channel's other AM and FM stations, which are now located in Burbank.\nThe Fox Broadcasting Company, which had maintained some business offices at the 20th Century Fox studios in Los Angeles' Century City neighborhood while at the Television Center, moved its complete base of operations to a new facility on the Century City studio lot shortly after the KTTV move; plans were announced for this facility in June 1997, by which time Fox's lease on the facility from Metromedia had run out (and construction on the new facility in Century City was ahead of schedule). This new facility, known as the Fox Network Center, is the home to the network's live studio productions (certain Fox Sports Net productions instead originated from a facility located in the Westwood district), and serves as the technical center of the Fox network (with Fox's satellite feeds beginning origination from the Network Center on December 31st, 1997).\nMetromedia sold the land to the Los Angeles Unified School District in 2000; the famed \"starsteps\" were dismantled and shipped to Chicago. The building was demolished by the school district in 2003 and replaced with Helen Bernstein High School, which opened in 2008.\n\nList of shows recorded at Metromedia Square\n227 (1985\u201387; remainder of series taped at Sunset Gower Studios)\nAll's Fair (1976-1977)\nAll in the Family (1975\u20131979)\nBaby Makes Five (1983)\nCatchphrase (1985\u201386)\nCelebrity Bowling (1971-1978)\nCollege Football Saturday (studio portions of national telecasts on Fox Sports Net, 1997)\nConcentration (syndicated version; for its entire run, 1973\u20131978)\nThe Cross-Wits (1975-1980)\nDiff'rent Strokes (1978\u20131982)\nDivorce Court (1957\u20131966)\nThe Facts of Life (1979\u20131982)\nFamily Ties (pilot episode only, 1982)\nFernwood 2 Night\/America 2 Night (1977-1978)\nFinders Keepers (1988-1989)\nFox Sports News (1996-1998)\nThe fX Sports Show (1995-96)\nThe 5 Mrs. Buchanans (for its entire run, 1994\u201395)\nGimme a Break!

It is named after pioneering Los Angeles civil engineer William Mulholland. The western rural portion in Los Angeles and Ventura Counties is named Mulholland Highway. The road is featured in a significant number of films, songs, and novels. David Lynch, who wrote and directed a film named after Mulholland Drive, has said that one can feel \"the history of Hollywood\" on it. Jack Nicholson has lived on Mulholland Drive for many years, and still did so as of 2009.\n\nHistory\nThe main portion of the road, from Cahuenga Pass in Hollywood westward past Sepulveda Pass, was originally called Mulholland Highway and was opened in 1924. It was built by a consortium of developers investing in the Hollywood Hills.  DeWitt Reaburn, the construction engineer responsible for the project, said while it was being built, \"The Mulholland Highway is destined to be one of the heaviest traveled and one of the best known scenic roads in the United States.\"\nThe street has experienced multiple closures throughout the years due to mudslides and storm damage, with the latest one being in 2024.\n\nGeography\nThe 21-mile (34 km) long mostly two-lane, minor arterial road loosely follows the ridgeline of the eastern Santa Monica Mountains and the Hollywood Hills, connecting two sections of U.S. Route 101, and crossing Sepulveda Boulevard, Beverly Glen Boulevard, Coldwater Canyon Avenue, Laurel Canyon Boulevard, Nichols Canyon Road, and Outpost Drive.\nThe road offers views of the Los Angeles Basin, the San Fernando Valley, Downtown Los Angeles and the Hollywood Sign.\nMulholland Drive has some of the most exclusive and expensive homes in the world, housing mainly Hollywood celebrities.\n\nRoute\nThe eastern terminus of Mulholland Drive is at its intersection with Cahuenga Boulevard at the Cahuenga Pass over the Santa Monica Mountains (at this point Cahuenga Boulevard runs adjacent to Highway 101\/The Hollywood Freeway). The road continues to the west, offering vistas of the Hollywood Sign, Downtown Los Angeles, and then Burbank, Universal City, and the rest of the San Fernando Valley with the San Gabriel, Verdugo, and Santa Susana Mountains.\nThe road winds along the top of the mountains until a few miles west of the San Diego\/Interstate 405 Freeway. Just west of the intersection with Encino Hills Drive, it becomes an unpaved road not open to motor vehicles. This part is known by many as \"Dirt Mulholland\". This portion connects with other unpaved roads and bike trails and allows access to a decommissioned Project Nike command post that is now a Cold War memorial park. (This portion of Mulholland Drive was open to through traffic as late as the 1990s before being permanently closed to motor vehicles so that they would no longer interfere with the natural beauty and wilderness of the area.)\nThe road opens again east of Topanga Canyon Boulevard (State Route 27) at Santa Maria Road but remains dirt until it reaches Saltillo Street. Shortly thereafter, the thoroughfare splits into Mulholland Drive and Mulholland Highway. Mulholland Drive terminates at U.S. Highway 101 (the Ventura Freeway), where it becomes Valley Circle Boulevard. Mulholland Highway continues to the southwest until it terminates at State Route 1 (PCH) in Leo Carrillo State Park at the Pacific Ocean coast and the border of Los Angeles and Ventura counties.\n\nSee also\nMulholland Highway\nSanta Monica Mountains\nSanta Monica Mountains National Recreation Area\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Mulholland Drive and Highway at Wikimedia Commons","158":"Naud Junction was an area in northern Downtown Los Angeles, California.

In 2022, Mexican Americans comprised 11.2% of the US population and 58.9% of all Hispanic and Latino Americans. In 2019, 71% of Mexican Americans were born in the United States. Mexicans born outside the US make up 53% of the total population of foreign-born Hispanic Americans and 25% of the total foreign-born population. Chicano is a term used by some to describe the unique identity held by Mexican-Americans. The United States is home to the second-largest Mexican community in the world (24% of the entire Mexican-origin population of the world), behind only Mexico. \nMost Mexican Americans reside in the Southwest, with more than 60% of Mexican Americans living in the states of California and Texas.\nMost Mexican Americans have varying degrees of Indigenous and European ancestry, with the latter being of mostly Spanish origins. Those of indigenous ancestry descend from one or more of the over 60 Indigenous groups in Mexico (approximately 200,000 people in California alone). \nIt is estimated that approximately 10% of the current Mexican-American population are descended from residents of the Spanish Empire and later Republic of Mexico, which preceded the acquisition of their territories by the United States; such groups include New Mexican Hispanos, Tejanos of Texas, and Californios. They became US citizens in 1848 through the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended the Mexican\u2013American War. Mexicans living in the United States after the treaty was signed were forced to choose between keeping their Mexican citizenship or becoming a US citizen. Few chose to leave their homes, despite the changes in national government. The majority of these Hispanophone populations eventually adopted English as their first language and became Americanized. Also called Hispanos, these descendants of independent Mexico from the early-to-middle 19th century differentiate themselves culturally from the population of Mexican Americans whose ancestors arrived in the American Southwest after the Mexican Revolution. The number of Mexican immigrants in the United States has sharply risen in recent decades.\n\nHistory of Mexican Americans\nIn 1900, there were slightly more than 500,000 Hispanics of Mexican descent living in New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, California, and Texas. Most were Mestizo Mexican Americans of Spanish and Indigenous descent, Spanish settlers, other Hispanicized European settlers who settled in the Southwest during Spanish colonial times, as well as local and Mexican Amerindians.\nNew Mexico Hispanos were a notably large majority of the southwest US population. The vast majority of Hispanos are genetically Mestizo with varying degrees of Spanish ancestry, as well as ancestry from Pueblos and various North American Indigenous tribes. New Mexico was far more populated since the 16th century in comparison to Texas & California.\nAs early as 1813, some of the Tejanos who colonized Texas in the Spanish Colonial Period established a government in Texas that desired independence from Spanish-ruled Mexico. In those days, there was no concept of identity as Mexican. Many Mexicans were more loyal to their states\/provinces than to their country as a whole, which was a colony of Spain. This was particularly true in frontier regions such as Zacatecas, Texas, Yucat\u00e1n, Oaxaca, New Mexico, etc.\nAs shown by the writings of colonial Tejanos such as Antonio Menchaca, the Texas Revolution was initially a colonial Tejano cause. Mexico encouraged immigration from the United States to settle east Texas and, by 1831, English-speaking settlers outnumbered Tejanos ten to one in the region. Both groups were settled mostly in the eastern part of the territory. The Mexican government became concerned about the increasing volume of Anglo-American immigration and restricted the number of settlers from the United States allowed to enter Texas. \nConsistent with its abolition of slavery, the Mexican government banned slavery within the state, which angered American slave owners. The American settlers, along with many of the Tejano, rebelled against the centralized authority of Mexico City and the Santa Anna regime, while other Tejano remained loyal to Mexico, and still others were neutral.\nAuthor John P. Schmal wrote of the effect Texas independence had on the Tejano community:\n\nA native of San Antonio, Juan Segu\u00edn is probably the most famous Tejano to be involved in the War of Texas Independence. His story is complex because he joined the Anglo rebels and helped defeat the Mexican forces of Santa Anna. But later on, as Mayor of San Antonio, he and other Tejano felt the hostile encroachments of the growing Anglo power against them. After receiving a series of death threats, Segu\u00edn relocated his family in Mexico. He was coerced into military service and fought against the US in 1846\u20131848 Mexican\u2013American War.\n\nAlthough the events of 1836 led to independence for the people of Texas, the Latino population of the state was very quickly disenfranchised, to the extent that their political representation in the Texas State Legislature disappeared entirely for several decades.\nAs a Spanish colony, the territory of California also had an established population of colonial settlers. Californios is the term for the Spanish-speaking residents of modern-day California; they were the original Mexicans (regardless of race) and local Hispanicized Amerindians in the region (Alta California) before the United States acquired it as a territory. In the mid-19th century, more settlers from the United States began to enter the territory.\nIn California, Mexican settlement had begun in 1769 with the establishment of the Presidio and Catholic mission of San Diego. 20 more missions were established along the California coast by 1823, along with military Presidios and civilian communities. Settlers in California tended to stay close to the coast and outside the California interior. The California economy was based on agriculture and livestock. In contrast to central New Spain, coastal colonists found little mineral wealth. Some became farmers or ranchers, working for themselves on their own land or for other colonists. Government officials, priests, soldiers, and artisans settled in towns, missions, and presidios.\nOne of the most important events in the history of Mexican settlers in California occurred in 1833, when the Mexican Government secularized the missions. In effect this meant that the government took control of large and vast areas of land. The government eventually distributed these lands among the elite of the population in the form of Ranchos, which soon became the basic socio-economic units of the province.\nRelations between Californios and English-speaking settlers were relatively good until 1846, when military officer John C. Fremont arrived in Alta California with a United States force of 60 men on an exploratory expedition. Fremont made an agreement with Comandante Castro that he would stay in the San Joaquin Valley only for the winter, then move north to Oregon. However, Fremont remained in the Santa Clara Valley then headed towards Monterey. When Castro demanded that Fremont leave Alta California, Fremont rode to Gavilan Peak, raised a US flag and vowed to fight to the last man to defend it. After three days of tension, Fremont retreated to Oregon without a shot being fired.\nWith relations between Californios and Americans quickly souring, Fremont returned to Alta California, where he encouraged European-American settlers to seize a group of Castro's soldiers and their horses. Another group seized the Presidio of Sonoma and captured Mariano Vallejo.\n\nThe Americans chose William B. Ide as Commander in Chief and on July 5, 1846, he proclaimed the creation of the Bear Flag Republic. On July 9, US military forces reached Sonoma; they lowered the Bear Flag Republic's flag, replacing it with a US flag. Californios organized an army to defend themselves from invading American forces after the Mexican army retreated from Alta California to defend other parts of Mexico.\nThe Californios defeated an American force in Los Angeles on September 30, 1846. In turn, they were defeated after the Americans reinforced their forces in what is now southern California. Tens of thousands of miners and associated people arrived during the California Gold Rush, and their activities in some areas meant the end of the Californios' ranching lifestyle. Many of the English-speaking 49ers turned from mining to farming and moved, often illegally, onto land granted to Californios by the former Mexican government.\nThe United States had first come into conflict with Mexico in the 1830s, as the westward spread of United States settlements and of slavery brought significant numbers of new settlers into the region known as Tejas (modern-day Texas), then part of Mexico. The Mexican\u2013American War, followed by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848 and the Gadsden Purchase in 1853, extended US control over a wide range of territory once held by Mexico, including the present-day borders of Texas and the states of New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Arizona and California.\n\nAlthough the treaty promised that the landowners in this newly acquired territory would have their property rights preserved and protected as if they were citizens of the United States, many former citizens of Mexico lost their land in lawsuits before state and federal courts over terms of land grants, or as a result of legislation passed after the treaty. Even those statutes which Congress passed to protect the owners of property at the time of the extension of the United States' borders, such as the 1851 California Land Act, had the effect of dispossessing Californio owners. They were ruined by the cost over years of having to maintain litigation to support their land titles.\nFollowing the concession of California to the United States under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Mexicans were repeatedly targeted by legislation that targeted their socio-economic standing in the area. One significant instance of this is exemplified by the passage of legislation that placed the heaviest tax burden on land. The fact that there was such a heavy tax on land was important to the socio-economic standing of Mexican Americans, because it essentially limited their ability to retain possession of the Ranchos that had been originally granted to them by the Mexican government.\n\n19th-century and Early 20th-century Mexican migration\nIn the late nineteenth century, liberal Mexican President Porfirio D\u00edaz embarked on a program of economic modernization that triggered not only a wave of internal migration in Mexico from rural areas to cities, but also Mexican emigration to the United States. A railway network was constructed that connected central Mexico to the US border and also opened up previously isolated regions. The second factor was the shift in land tenure that left Mexican peasants without title or access to land for farming on their own account. \n\nFor the first time, Mexicans in increasing numbers migrated north into the United States for better economic opportunities. In the early 20th century, the first main period of migration to the United States happened between the 1910s to the 1920s, referred to as the Great Migration. During this time period the Mexican Revolution was taking place, creating turmoil within and against the Mexican government causing civilians to seek out economic and political stability in the United States. Over 1.3 million Mexicans relocated to the United States from 1910 well into the 1930s, with significant increases each decade. Many of these immigrants found agricultural work, being contracted under private laborers.\nDuring the Great Depression in the 1930s, many Mexicans and Mexican Americans were repatriated to Mexico. Many deportations were overseen by state and local authorities who acted on the encouragement of Secretary of Labor William N. Doak and the Department of Labor. The government deported at least 82,000 people. Between 355,000 and 1,000,000 were repatriated or deported to Mexico in total; approximately forty to sixty percent of those repatriated were birthright citizens \u2013 overwhelmingly children. Voluntary repatriation was much more common during the repatriations than formal deportation. According to legal professor Kevin R. Johnson, the repatriation campaign was based on ethnicity and meets the modern legal standards of ethnic cleansing, because it frequently ignored individuals' citizenship.\nThe second period of increased migration is known as the Bracero Era from 1942 to 1964. This referred to the Bracero program implemented by the United States beginning in World War II. They contracted agricultural labor from Mexico due to labor shortages from the World War II draft. An estimated 4.6 million Mexican immigrants were pulled into the United States through the Bracero Program from the 1940s to the 1960s. The lack of agricultural laborers due to increases in military drafts for World War II opened up a chronic need for \nlow-wage workers to fill jobs.\n\nLate 20th century to early 21st century\nWhile Mexican Americans are concentrated in the Southwest: California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, during World War I many moved to industrial communities such as St. Louis, Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and other steel-producing regions, where they gained industrial jobs. Like European immigrants, they were attracted to work that did not require proficiency in English. Industrial restructuring in the second half of the century put many Mexican Americans out of work in addition to people of other ethnic groups. Their industrial skills were not as useful in the changing economies of these areas.\n\nThe Delano grape strike was influenced by the Filipino-American farm worker strike in Coachella Valley, May 1965. Migrant Filipino-American workers asked for a $0.15\/hour raise.\nThe 1965 Delano grape strike, sparked by mostly Filipino American farmworkers, became an intersectional struggle when labor leaders and voting rights and civil rights activists Dolores Huerta, founder of the National Farm Workers Association, and her co-leader C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez united with the strikers to form the United Farm Workers. Huerta's slogan \"S\u00ed, se puede\" (Spanish for \"Yes we can\"), was popularized by Ch\u00e1vez's fast. It became a rallying cry for the Chicano Movement or Mexican-American civil rights movement. The Chicano movement aimed for a variety of civil rights reforms and was inspired by the civil rights movement; demands ranged from the restoration of land grants to farm workers' rights, to enhanced education, to voting and political rights, as well as emerging awareness of collective history. The Chicano walkouts of antiwar students is traditionally seen as the start of the more radical phase of the Chicano movement.\nMexican Americans were found to place more importance on social and economic issues than they do on immigration. Those who are not citizens care considerably more about social issues. Both citizens and noncitizens identify ethnic issues as the key problem that Mexican Americans face, highlighting the need for stronger community and political organization.\nSince there were not many job opportunities in their country, Mexicans moved to the United States to gain work. They often had to settle for low-paying jobs, including as agricultural workers. \n\nDuring this period, civil rights groups such as the National Mexican-American Anti-Defamation Committee were founded.  By the early 21st century, the states with the largest percentages and populations of Mexican Americans are California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Colorado, Nevada and Utah. There have also been markedly increasing populations in Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Illinois.\nIn terms of religion, Mexican Americans are primarily Roman Catholic, which was largely established in culture during the Spanish and Mexican periods. A large minority are Evangelical Protestants. Notably, according to a Pew Hispanic Center report in 2006 and the Pew Religious Landscape Survey in 2008, Mexican Americans are significantly less likely than other Latino groups to abandon Catholicism for Protestant churches.\nIn 2008, \"Yes We Can\" (in Spanish: \"S\u00ed, se puede\") was adopted as the 2008 campaign slogan of Senator Barack Obama. His election in 2008 and reelection in 2012 as the first African American president depended in part on the growing importance of the Mexican American vote. \nThe struggle of presidents of both Democratic and Republican administrations to solve immigration reform in the United States has led in part to an increased polarization in the nation over an increasingly diverse population. Mexican Americans have increasingly settled in areas other than traditional centers in the Southwest and Chicago.\nMost Mexican Roma came to the United States from Argentina. In 2015, the United States admitted 157,227 Mexican immigrants, and as of November 2016, 1.31 million Mexicans were on the waiting list to immigrate to the United States through legal means.\nA 2014 survey showed that 34% of Mexicans would immigrate to the United States if given the opportunity, with 17% saying they would do it illegally.\n\nRace and ethnicity\nEthnically, Mexican Americans are a diverse population made up primarily of Indigenous and European ancestry, along with African. Also on a smaller scale, some also have backgrounds of East Asian and Middle Eastern descent (mainly Lebanese). The majority of the Mexican population identifies as mestizo. In colonial times, Mestizo was understood to be a person of mixed heritage, particularly European and Native American. \nThe meaning of the word has changed through time, and in the early 21st century, it is used to refer to the segment of the Mexican population who are of at least partial Indigenous ancestry, but do not speak Indigenous languages. \nThus in Mexico, the term \"Mestizo\",  while still applying mostly to people who are of mixed European and Indigenous descent, to various degrees, has become more of a cultural label rather than a racial one. It is vaguely defined and may include people who do not have Indigenous ancestry, people who do not have European ancestry, as well as people of mixed descent.\nSuch transformation of the word is the result of a concept known as \"mestizaje\", which was promoted by the post-revolutionary Mexican government in an effort to create a united Mexican ethno-cultural identity with no racial distinctions. It is because of this that sometimes the Mestizo population in Mexico is estimated to be as high as 93% of the Mexican population.\nPer the 2010 US Census, the majority (52.8%) of Mexican Americans identified as being white. The remainder identified themselves as being of \"some other race\" (39.5%), \"two or more races\" (5.0%), Native American (0.4%), black (2%) and Asian \/ Pacific Islander (0.1%). It is notable that only 5% of Mexican Americans reported being of two or more races despite the presumption of mestizaje among the Mexican population in Mexico.\n\n This identification as \"some other race\" reflects activism among Mexican Americans as claiming a cultural status and working for their rights in the United States, as well as the separation due to different language and culture. Hispanics are not a racial classification but an ethnic group.\nThe barrier that the language places on people who are immigrating from Mexico is difficult due to the importance that is placed in the United States related to knowing how to speak English. The lack of support from surrounding people places an even more difficult strain given that there is not much remorse or yet very little patience that comes from those who these Mexican immigrants may find themselves seeking aid from.\nGenetic studies made in the Mexican population have found their common ancestry at 58.96% European, 31.05% Amerindian and 10.03% African. There is genetic asymmetry, with the direct paternal line predominately European and the maternal line predominately Amerindian. Younger Mexican Americans tend to have more Indigenous ancestry; in those studied born between the 1940s and 1990s, there was an average increase in Indigenous ancestry of 0.4% per year. Though there is no simple explanation, it is possibly some combination of assortative mating, changes in migration patterns over time (with more recent immigrants coming from areas of more concentrated Indigenous communities), population growth and other unexamined factors.\n\nFor instance, a 2006 study conducted by Mexico's National Institute of Genomic Medicine (INMEGEN), which genotyped 104 samples, reported that Mestizo Mexicans are 58.96% European, 35.05% Amerindian, and 5.03% African. According to a 2009 report by the Mexican Genome Project, which sampled 300 Mestizos from six Mexican states and one Indigenous group, the gene pool of the Mexican mestizo population was calculated to be 55.2% percent Indigenous, 41.8% European, 5% African, and 0.5% Asian. A 2012 study published by the Journal of Human Genetics found the deep paternal ancestry of the Mexican Mestizo population to be predominately European (64.9%) followed by Amerindian (30.8%) and African (5%). \nAn autosomal ancestry study performed in 2007 on residents of Mexico City reported that the European ancestry of Mexicans was 52%, with the rest being Amerindian and some African contribution. Maternal ancestry was analyzed, with 47% being of European origin. Unlike previous studies that included only Mexicans who self-identified as Mestizos, the only criteria for sample selection in this study was that the volunteers self-identified as Mexicans.\nWhile Mexico does not have comprehensive modern racial censuses, some international publications believe that Mexican people of predominately European descent (Spanish or other European) make up approximately one-sixth (16.5%); this is based on the figures of the last racial census in the country, made in 1921. According to an opinion poll conducted by the Latinobar\u00f3metro organization in 2011, 52% of Mexican respondents said they were mestizos, 19% Indigenous, 6% white, 2% mulattos, and 3% \"other race\".\n\nUS Census Bureau classifications\nAs the United States' borders expanded, the United States Census Bureau changed its racial classification methods for Mexican Americans under United States jurisdiction. The Bureau's classification system has evolved significantly from its inception:\n\nFrom 1790 to 1850, there was no distinct racial classification of Mexican Americans in the US census. The categories recognized by the Census Bureau were White,  Free People of Color, and Black. The Census Bureau estimates that during this period the number of persons who could not be categorized as white or black did not exceed 0.25% of the total population based on 1860 census data.\nFrom 1850 through 1920, the Census Bureau expanded its racial categories to include multi-racial persons, under Mestizos,  Mulattos, as well as new categories of distinction of Amerindians and Asians. It classified Mexicans and Mexican Americans as \"white\".\nThe 1930 US census added a separate category for \"color\" or \"race\" which declassified Mexicans as white. Census workers were instructed to write \"W\" for white and \"Mex\" for Mexican. Other categories were \"Neg\" for Negro; \"In\" for Amerindian; \"Ch\" for Chinese; \"Jp\" for Japanese; \"Fil\" for Filipino; \"Hin\" for Hindu; and \"Kor\" for Korean.\nIn the 1940 census, due to widespread protests by the Mexican American community following the 1930 changes, Mexican Americans were re-classified as White. Instructions for enumerators were: \"Mexicans \u2013 Report 'White' (W) for Mexicans unless they are definitely of Indigenous or other non-white race.\" During the same census, however, the bureau began to track the White population of Spanish mother tongue. This practice continued through the 1960 census. The 1960 census also used the title \"Spanish-surnamed American\" in their reporting data of Mexican Americans; this category also covered Cuban Americans, Puerto Ricans and others under the same category.\nFrom 1970 to 1980, there was a dramatic increase in the number of people who identified as \"of Other Race\" in the census, reflecting the addition of a question on 'Latino origin' to the 100-percent questionnaire, an increased propensity for Latinos to identify as other than White as they agitated for civil rights, and a change in editing procedures to accept reports of \"Other race\" for respondents who wrote in ethnic Hispanic entries, such as Mexican, Cuban, or Puerto Rican. In 1970, such responses in the Other race category were reclassified and tabulated as white. During this census, the bureau attempted to identify all Hispanics by use of the following criteria in sampled sets:\nSpanish speakers and persons belonging to a household where the head of household was a Spanish speaker\npersons with Spanish heritage by birth location or surname\nPersons who self-identified Spanish origin or descent\nFrom 1980 on, the Census Bureau has collected data on Latino origin on a 100-percent basis. The bureau has noted in 2002 that an increasing number of respondents identify as of Latino origin but not of the White race.\nFor certain purposes, respondents who wrote in \"Chicano\" or \"Mexican\" (or indeed, almost all Latino origin groups) in the \"Some other race\" category were automatically re-classified into the \"White race\" group.\n\nPolitics and debate of racial classification\nIn some cases, legal classification of White racial status has made it difficult for Mexican-American rights activists to prove minority discrimination. In the case Hernandez v. Texas (1954), civil rights lawyers for the appellant, named Pedro Hernandez, were confronted with a paradox: because Mexican Americans were classified as White by the federal government and not as a separate race in the census, lower courts held that they were not being denied equal protection by being tried by juries that excluded Mexican Americans by practice. The lower court ruled there was no violation of the Fourteenth Amendment by excluding people with Mexican ancestry among the juries. Attorneys for the state of Texas and judges in the state courts contended that the amendment referred only to racial, not \"nationality\", groups. Thus, since Mexican Americans were tried by juries composed of their racial group\u2014whites\u2014their constitutional rights were not violated. The US Supreme Court ruling in Hernandez v. Texas case held that \"nationality\" groups could be protected under the Fourteenth Amendment, and it became a landmark in the civil rights history of the United States.\n\nWhile Mexican Americans served in all-White units during World War II, many Mexican\u2013American veterans continued to face discrimination when they arrived home; they created the G.I. Forum to work for equal treatment.\nIn times and places in the United States where Mexicans were classified as White, they were permitted by law to intermarry with what today are termed \"non-Latino whites\". Social customs typically approved of such marriages only if the Mexican partner was not of visible Indigenous ancestry.\nIn the late 1960s the founding of the Crusade for Justice in Denver and the land grant movement in New Mexico in 1967 set the bases for what would become known as Chicano (Mexican American) nationalism. The 1968 Los Angeles, California school walkouts expressed Mexican-American demands to end de facto ethnic segregation (also based on residential patterns), increase graduation rates, and reinstate a teacher fired for supporting student political organizing. A notable event in the Chicano movement was the 1972 Convention of La Raza Unida (United People) Party, which organized with the goal of creating a third party to give Chicanos political power in the United States.\nIn the past, Mexicans were legally considered \"White\" because either they were accepted as being of Spanish ancestry, or because of early treaty obligations to Spaniards and Mexicans that conferred citizenship status to Mexican peoples before the American Civil War. Numerous slave states bordered Mexican territory at a time when 'whiteness' was nearly a prerequisite for US citizenship in those states.\n\nAlthough Mexican Americans were legally classified as \"white\" in terms of official federal policy, socially they were seen as \"too Indian\" to be treated as such. Many organizations, businesses, and homeowners associations and local legal systems had official policies in the early 20th century to exclude Mexican Americans in a racially discriminatory way. Throughout the Southwest, discrimination in wages was institutionalized in \"White wages\" versus lower \"Mexican wages\" for the same job classifications. For Mexican Americans, opportunities for employment were largely limited to guest worker programs.\nThe bracero program, begun in 1942 during World War II, when many United States men were drafted for war, allowed Mexicans temporary entry into the United States as migrant workers at farms throughout California and the Southwest. This program continued until 1964.\n\nWhile both Mexican American and African American minorities were subject to segregation and racial discrimination, they were treated differently. Segregation is the physical separation of peoples on the basis of ethnicity and social custom historically applied to separate African Americans and Mexican Americans from Whites in Texas. Racial attitudes that supported segregation of African Americans probably arrived in Texas during the 1820s in company with the \"peculiar institution,\" slavery. Anglo-Americans began extending segregation to Mexican Americans after the Texas Revolution as a social custom. Tejanos formed a suspect class during and after the revolution, and that fact led to a general aversion of them. After the Civil War, segregation developed as a method of group control. For both minority groups, segregation existed in schools, churches, residential districts, and most public places such as restaurants, theaters, and barber shops. By the latter years of the nineteenth century, institutionalized segregation flourished legally in places with a visible Black population and was extended informally to Tejanos. Most Texas towns and cities had a \"Negro quarter\" and a \"Mexican quarter.\"\nAlthough the law specified until 1890 that Black schools were to have equal access to the common school fund, they often did not. In the early twentieth century, Black and Mexican schools faced lamentable conditions endemic in an antiquated educational system, and educational reforms of the Progressive era did not improve matters. During the 1920s, Black schoolchildren were more likely to miss school than White students, Black teachers received less pay and training than their White counterparts, and teaching accommodations ordinarily amounted to one-room buildings generally under the tutelage of a single teacher. The same circumstances applied to Hispanic students, who were segregated because some Whites thought them \"dirty\" and because some White employers desired an uneducated, inexpensive labor pool. Whatever schools existed often suffered from inadequate financing, poor educational facilities, and racist curriculum.\n\nDemographics\nMexican Americans are concentrated in California (34%), Texas (26%) and Arizona (5%).\nThe counties with the largest Mexican population are Los Angeles County, Harris County, Cook County and Dallas County. The metropolitan areas with the largest Mexican population is Greater Los Angeles, the Chicago metropolitan area, Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex, and Greater Houston.\nMexican Americans have long been the second largest minority group in the United States after African Americans.\nThe Mexican American population was still concentrated in Southwestern states such as Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Texas, and California in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Mexican Americans starting moving from the southwestern to large northeastern and midwestern cities after World War II. Large Mexican American communities developed in cities in the northeast and midwest such as St. Louis, Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh. Around 90 percent of Mexicans in the United States live in urban areas.\nThere is recent Mexican enclaves in Salt Lake City and Atlanta.\nThe Mexican population has been rapidly increasing in North Carolina and Georgia.\nMexican Americans have the highest fertility rate in the United States. While only 10% of the United States's population was Mexican American in the year 2008, 16% of the country's births were to Mexican mothers. Mexican-Americans are generally younger than other racial and ethnic groups in the United States. Mexican Americans also have more children than other races and Hispanic groups in the United States.\n\nMexican-born population over time\nCulture\nMexican American culture reflects the influences of Spain, Mexico, and indigenous cultures.\nFamily units and structures are typically larger among Mexican Americans. Parents and elders are treated with a high degree of respect by Mexican Americans. Mexican Americans often celebrate Quinceanerais.\n\nFood and drink\nMexican Americans have influenced American cuisine, burritos, enchiladas, guacamole, nachos, tacos, tamales, and tortillas, are regular in American vernacular. The cuisines of New Mexican and Tex-Mex are native to the cuisine of the Southwestern United States, and Mexican cuisine has influenced Californian cuisine.\n\nMusic\nThe popular radio format Regional Mexican includes Mexican styles of music; Norte\u00f1o, ranchera, Conjunto, Son Jarocho, Cumbia, and mariachi. It also includes the indigenous and Mexican American music styles of the New Mexico music, Tejano music, Chicano rock, Chicano rap and Cumbia rap, which originate in the United States.\n\nEconomic and social issues\nImmigration issues\nSee also Strangers No Longer: Together on the Journey of Hope, a pastoral letter written by both the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Mexican Episcopal Conference, which deals with the issue of migration in the context of the United States and Mexico.\n\nSince the 1960s, Mexican immigrants have met a significant portion of the demand for low cost labor in the United States.  Fear of deportation makes them highly vulnerable to exploitation by employers. Many employers, however, have developed a \"don't ask, don't tell\" attitude toward hiring undocumented Mexican nationals. In May 2006, hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants, Mexicans and other nationalities, walked out of their jobs across the country in protest to support immigration reform (many in hopes of a path to citizenship similar to the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 signed into law by President Ronald Reagan, which granted citizenship to Mexican nationals living and working without documentation in the US). Governmentalities have been the result of unequal relations with its northern neighbors versus a response to more locally driven needs.\nUS politicians cited numbers as high as 20 million undocumented immigrants in the United States without providing statistical proof.\n\nSome immigrants to the United States, both from Mexico and elsewhere, oppose illegal immigration, even if they once lacked documents themselves.  However, according to a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in June 2007, 63% of Americans would support an immigration policy that would put undocumented immigrants on a path to citizenship if they \"pass background checks, pay fines and have jobs, learn English\", while 30% would oppose such a plan. The survey also found that if this program was instead labeled \"amnesty\", 54% would support it, while 39% would oppose.\nAlan Greenspan, former Chairman of the Federal Reserve, has said that the growth of the working-age population is a large factor in keeping the economy growing and that immigration can be used to grow that population. According to Greenspan, by 2030, the growth of the US workforce will slow from 1 percent to 1\/2 percent, while the percentage of the population over 65 years will rise from 13 percent to perhaps 20 percent. Greenspan has also stated that immigration reform could be brought about with a \"stroke of the pen\", referring to the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 which would have created a guest worker program and put undocumented immigrants currently residing in the US on a path to citizenship if they met certain conditions.\n\nDiscrimination and stereotypes\nThroughout US history, Mexican Americans have endured various types of negative stereotypes which have long circulated in media and popular culture. Mexican Americans have also faced discrimination based on ethnicity, race, culture, poverty, and use of the Spanish language.\nMexicans faced racially segregated schooling in a number of Western states during the Depression era. In Wyoming, the segregation of Mexican children\u2014regardless of US citizenship\u2014mirrored the South's Jim Crow laws. The segregation of Mexicans also occurred in California and in neighboring Colorado, Montana, and Nebraska.\nSince the majority of undocumented immigrants in the US have traditionally been from Latin America, the Mexican American community has been the subject of widespread immigration raids. During The Great Depression, the United States government sponsored a Mexican Repatriation program which was intended to encourage people to voluntarily move to Mexico, but thousands were deported against their will. During the 1930s, between 355 000 and 1 million individuals were repatriated or deported to Mexico, approximately 40 to 60 percent of which were actually United States citizens \u2013 overwhelmingly children. Voluntary repatriation was far more common than formal deportation. In the post-war era, the Justice Department launched Operation Wetback.\n\nDuring World War II, more than 300,000 Mexican Americans served in the US armed forces. Mexican Americans were generally integrated into regular military units; however, many Mexican\u2013American War veterans were discriminated against and even denied medical services by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs when they arrived home. In 1948, war veteran Hector P. Garcia founded the American GI Forum to address the concerns of Mexican American veterans who were being discriminated against. The AGIF's first campaign was on the behalf of Felix Longoria, a Mexican American private who was killed in the Philippines while in the line of duty. Upon the return of his body to his hometown of Three Rivers, Texas, he was denied funeral services because of his nationality.\nThe Zoot Suit riots took place from June 3\u20138, 1943, in Los Angeles involving white American servicemen stationed in Southern California and young Latino and Mexican American city residents. It was one of the dozen wartime industrial cities that suffered race-related riots in the summer of 1943. White servicemen and white Angelenos attacked and stripped children, teenagers, and youths who wore zoot suits. While most of the violence was directed toward Mexican American youth, and African American youths who were wearing zoot suits were also attacked. The defiance of zoot suiters became inspirational for Chicanos during the Chicano Movement that worked to embrace a Chicano identity and worldview that combated structural racism.\n\nIn the 1948 case of Perez v. Sharp, the Supreme Court of California recognized that the ban on interracial marriage violated the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution from 1868. The case involved Andrea Perez, a Mexican-American woman listed as White, and Sylvester Davis, an African American man.\nIn 1971, U.S. president Richard Nixon is recorded exhibiting prejudice toward Mexican Americans and African Americans. Referring to Latinos he states, \"At the present time they steal, they're dishonest, but they do have some concept of family life. They don't live like a bunch of dogs, which the Negroes do live like.\"\n\nIn 2006, Time magazine reported that the number of hate groups in the United States increased by 33% since 2000, with illegal immigration being used as a foundation for recruitment. According to the 2011 Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Hate Crimes Statistics Report, 56.9% of the 939 victims of crimes motivated by a bias toward the victims' ethnicity or national origin were directed at Latinos. In California, the state with the largest Mexican American population, the number of hate crimes committed against Latinos almost doubled from 2003 to 2007. In 2011, hate crimes against Hispanics declined 31% in the United States and 43% in California. The 2019 El Paso shooting which resulted in 23 deaths, was a result of the gunman's racist attitude towards Mexican Americans and Latino immigrants in general.\nIn 2015, future president Donald Trump offended Mexican Americans by stating \"They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\" He built the Trump wall to prevent undocumented Mexican immigrants from entering the United States.\nAlthough many Mexican Americans descend from indigenous Amerindians, and although many Mexican Americans have been in country for many generations, Mexicans are often seen and stereotyped as newly arrived cultural parasites and border hoppers in the United States. Mexican men are stereotyped as illiterate criminals. Mexican women are depicted as hypersexual. Mexicans are stereotyped as lazy, dirty, physically unattractive menaces.\n\nSocial status and assimilation\nThere have been increases in average personal and household incomes for Mexican Americans in the 21st century. US-born Americans of Mexican heritage earn more and are represented more in the middle and upper-class segments more than most recently arriving Mexican immigrants.\n\nMost immigrants from Mexico, as elsewhere, come from the lower classes and from families generationally employed in lower skilled jobs. They also are most likely from rural areas. Thus, many new Mexican immigrants are not skilled in white collar professions. Recently, some professionals from Mexico have been migrating, but to make the transition from one country to another involves re-training and re-adjusting to conform to US laws \u2014i.e. professional licensing is required. Millions crossed into the United States to find work that would help them survive as well as sustain their families in Mexico. However now, Mexican Americans, primarily those who are bilingual are being used by firms to attract immigrant clientele. More value is being placed on Mexican Americans because they possess the ability to communicate with Spanish-speaking clients, thus expanding the customer range of companies.\n\nAccording to James P. Smith, the children and grandchildren of Hispanic immigrants tend to lessen educational and income gaps with White American. Immigrant Latino men earn about half of what whites make, while second generation US-born Hispanics make about 78 percent of the salaries of their white counterparts and by the third generation US-born Latinos make on average identical wages to their US-born white counterparts. However, the number of Mexican American professionals have been growing in size since 2010.  According to Guti\u00e9rrez, Ram\u00f3n throughout the 1980s, single Mexican women have made up an important portion of this migration, they are representing up to 40% of the total immigrant movement. Mexican women are mostly employed in service-related jobs such as service workers, housekeepers, and nannies, with a smaller involvement in agricultural labor. While Mexicans who have strong academic skills, have been granted with legal status in the United States, and their percentage is less compared to the infusion of unskilled immigrants.\nHuntington (2005) argues that the sheer number, concentration, linguistic homogeneity, and other characteristics of Latin American immigrants will erode the dominance of English as a nationally unifying language, weaken the country's dominant cultural values, and promote ethnic allegiances over a primary identification as an American. Testing these hypotheses with data from the US Census and national and Los Angeles opinion surveys, Citrin et al. (2007) show that Latinos generally acquire English and lose Spanish rapidly beginning with the second generation, and appear to be no more or less religious or committed to the work ethic than native-born non-Mexican American whites. However, the children and grandchildren of Mexican immigrants were able to make close ties with their extended families in Mexico, since United States shares a 2,000-mile border with Mexico. Many had the opportunity to visit Mexico on a relatively frequent basis. As a result, many Mexicans were able to maintain a strong Mexican culture, language, and relationship with others.\nSouth et al. (2005) examine Hispanic spatial assimilation and inter-neighborhood geographic mobility. Their longitudinal analysis of seven hundred Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Cuban immigrants followed from 1990 to 1995 finds broad support for hypotheses derived from the classical account of assimilation into American society. High income, English-language use, and embeddedness in American social contexts increased Latin American immigrants' geographic mobility into multi-ethnic neighborhoods. US citizenship and years spent in the United States were positively associated with geographic mobility into different neighborhoods while co-ethnic contact and prior experiences of ethnic discrimination decreased the likelihood that Latino immigrants would move from their original neighborhoods and into non-Latino white census tracts.\n\nIntermarriage\nAccording to 2000 census data, US-born ethnic Mexicans have a high degree of intermarriage with non-Latino whites.  Based on a sample size of 38,911 US-born Mexican husbands and 43,527 US-born Mexican wives:\n\n50.6% of US-born Mexican men and 45.3% of US-born Mexican women were married to US-born Mexicans;\n26.7% of US-born Mexican men and 28.1% of US-born Mexican women were married to non-Hispanic whites; and\n13.6% of US-born Mexican men and 17.4% of US-born Mexican women were married to Mexico-born Mexicans.\nIn addition, based on 2000 data, there is a significant amount of ethnic absorption of ethnic Mexicans into the mainstream population with 16% of the children of mixed marriages not being identified in the census as Mexican.\nA study done by the National Research Council (US) Panel on Hispanics in the United States published in 2006 looked at not only marriages, but also non-marriage unions.  It found that since at least 1980, marriage for females across all Hispanic ethnic groups, including Mexican Americans, has been in a steady decline. In addition, the percentage of births to unmarried mothers increased for females of Mexican descent from 20.3% in 1980 to 40.8% in 2000, more than doubling in that time frame. The study also found that for females of all Hispanic ethnicities, including Mexican origin, \"considerably fewer births to unmarried Latino mothers involve partnerships with non-Latino white males than is the case for married Latino mothers.  Second, births outside marriage are more likely to involve a non-Latino black father than births within marriage.\"  Additionally, \"Unions among partners from different Latino origins or between Latinos and non-Latino blacks are considerably more evident in cohabitation and parenthood than they are in marriage. In particular, unions between Latinos and non-Latino blacks are prominent in parenthood, especially non-marital births.\" Furthermore, for 29.7% of unmarried births to native-born females of Mexican origin and 40% of unmarried births to females of \"Other Latino\" origin, which may include Mexican American, information on the father's ethnicity was missing.  The study was supported by the US Census Bureau, among other sources.\n\nDouble-Marginalization\nTwo marginalized identities has a bigger impact on the oppression and struggles that the oppressed face. This is specially true in the case of women and immigrants. The level of education and the cultural factors directly effect women facing domestic violence, and women with lower levels of literacy have a higher vulnerability in facing abuse.\n\nSegregation issues\nHousing market practices\nStudies have shown that the segregation among Mexican Americans and Mexican immigrants seems to be declining. One study from 1984 found that Mexican American applicants were offered the same housing terms and conditions as non-Hispanic white Americans. They were asked to provide the same information (regarding employment, income, credit checks, etc.) and asked to meet the same general qualifications of their non-Hispanic white peers. In this same study, it was found that Mexican Americans were more likely than non-Hispanic white Americans to be asked to pay a security deposit or application fee and Mexican American applicants were also more likely to be placed onto a waiting list than non-Latino white applicants.\n\nBattle of Chavez Ravine\nThe Battle of Chavez Ravine has several meanings, but often refers to controversy surrounding government acquisition of land largely owned by Mexican Americans in Los Angeles' Chavez Ravine over approximately ten years (1951\u20131961). The eventual result was the removal of the entire population of Chavez Ravine from land on which Dodger Stadium was later constructed. The great majority of the Chavez Ravine land was acquired to make way for proposed public housing.  The public housing plan that had been advanced as politically \"progressive\" and had resulted in the removal of the Mexican American landowners of Chavez Ravine, was abandoned after passage of a public referendum prohibiting the original housing proposal and election of a conservative Los Angeles mayor opposed to public housing. Years later, the land acquired by the government in Chavez Ravine was dedicated by the city of Los Angeles as the site of what is now Dodger Stadium.\n\nHispanic segregation versus Black segregation\nWhen comparing the contemporary segregation of Mexican Americans to that of Black Americans, some scholars claim that \"Hispanic segregation is less severe and fundamentally different from Black residential segregation.\" suggesting that the segregation faced by Latinos is more likely to be due to factors such as lower socioeconomic status and immigration while the segregation of African Americans is more likely to be due to larger issues of the history of racism in the US.\nLegally, Mexican Americans could vote and hold elected office, however, it was not until the creation of organizations such as the League of United Latin America Citizens and the G.I. Forum that Mexican Americans began to achieve political influence. Edward Roybal's election to the Los Angeles City Council in 1949 and then to Congress in 1962 also represented this rising Mexican American political power. In the late 1960s the founding of the Crusade for Justice in Denver in and the land grant movement in New Mexico in 1967 set the bases for what would become the Chicano (Mexican American) nationalism. The 1968 Los Angeles school walkouts expressed Mexican American demands to end segregation, increase graduation rates, and reinstate a teacher fired for supporting student organizing. A notable event in the Chicano movement was the 1972 Convention of La Raza Unida (United People) Party, which organized with the goal of creating a third party that would give Chicanos political power in the United States.\n\nIn the past, Mexicans were legally considered \"White\" because either they were considered to be of full Spanish heritage, or because of early treaty obligations to Spaniards and Mexicans that conferred citizenship status to Mexican peoples at a time when whiteness was a prerequisite for US citizenship. Although Mexican Americans were legally classified as \"White\" in terms of official federal policy, many organizations, businesses, and homeowners associations and local legal systems had official policies to exclude Mexican Americans. Throughout the southwest discrimination in wages were institutionalized in \"white wages\" versus lower \"Mexican wages\" for the same job classifications. For Mexican Americans, opportunities for employment were largely limited to guest worker programs. The bracero program, which began in 1942 and officially ended in 1964, allowed them temporary entry into the United States as migrant workers in farms throughout California and the Southwest.\nMexican Americans legally classified as \"White\", following anti-miscegenation laws in most western states until the 1960s, could not legally marry African or Asian Americans (See Perez v. Sharp). However, most were not socially considered white, and therefore, according to Historian Neil Foley in the book The White Scourge: Mexicans, Blacks, and Poor Whites in Texas Cotton Culture, Mexicans and Mexican-Americans did marry non-whites typically without reprisal.\nDespite the similarities between Mexican American and African American patterns of segregation, there were important differences. The racial demarcations between whites and blacks in a state like Texas were inviolable, whereas those between whites and Mexican Americans were not. It was possible for Mexican Americans to attend white schools and colleges, mix socially with whites and marry whites: all of these things were impossible for African Americans, largely due to the legalized nature of black-white segregation. Racial segregation was rarely as rigid for Mexican Americans as it was for African Americans, even in situations where African Americans enjoyed higher economic status than Mexican Americans.\n\nSegregated schools\nIn the 1940s in Texas, Mexican American children were at times forced to register at \"Mexican schools\", where classroom conditions were poor, the school year was shorter, and the quality of education was substandard.\nVarious reasons for the inferiority of the education given to Mexican American students have been listed by James A. Ferg-Cadima including: inadequate resources, poor equipment, unfit building construction. In 1923, the Texas Education Survey Commission found that the school year for some non-white groups was 1.6 months shorter than the average school year. Some have interpreted the shortened school year as a \"means of social control\" implementing policies to ensure that Mexican Americans would maintain the unskilled labor force required for a strong economy. A lesser education would serve to confine Mexican Americans to the bottom rung of the social ladder. By limiting the number of days that Mexican Americans could attend school and allotting time for these same students to work, in mainly agricultural and seasonal jobs, the prospects for higher education and upward mobility were slim.\n\nImmigration and segregation\nHistorically, immigrants first settled in immigration hubs, where immigrants of similar background settle after they first arrive to the United States. Although they are segregated from the general population, hubs have helped many immigrants to acclimate to the United States, learn English, accumulate wealth, and once they are established, move into mainstream society.\nThis model of immigration and residential segregation, explained above, is the model which has historically been accurate in describing the experiences of Latino immigrants. However, the patterns of immigration seen today no longer follows this model. This old model is termed the standard spatial assimilation model. More contemporary models are the polarization model and the diffusion model: The spatial assimilation model posits that as immigrants would live within this country's borders, they would simultaneously become more comfortable in their new surroundings, their socioeconomic status would rise, and their ability to speak English would increase. The combination of these changes would allow for the immigrant to move out of the barrio and into the dominant society. This type of assimilation reflects the experiences of immigrants of the early twentieth century.\nPolarization model suggests that the immigration of non-black minorities into the United States further separates blacks and whites, as though the new immigrants are a buffer between them. This creates a hierarchy in which blacks are at the bottom, whites are at the top, and other groups fill the middle. In other words, the polarization model posits that Asians and Hispanics are less segregated than their African-American peers because white American society would rather live closer to Asians or Latinos than African-Americans.\nThe diffusion model has also been suggested as a way of describing the immigrant's experience within the United States. This model is rooted in the belief that as time passes, more and more immigrants enter the country. This model suggests that as the United States becomes more populated with a more diverse set of peoples, stereotypes and discriminatory practices will decrease, as awareness and acceptance increase. The diffusion model predicts that new immigrants will break down old patterns of discrimination and prejudice, as one becomes more and more comfortable with the more diverse neighborhoods that are created through the influx of immigrants. Applying this model to the experiences of Mexican Americans forces one to see Mexican American immigrants as positive additions to the \"American melting pot\", in which as more additions are made to the pot, the more equal and accepting society will become.\n\nThe Chicano movement and the Chicano Moratorium\nThe Chicano Moratorium, formally known as the National Chicano Moratorium Committee, was a movement of Chicano anti-war activists that built a broad-based but fragile coalition of Mexican-American groups to organize opposition to the Vietnam War. The committee was led by activists from local colleges and members of the \"Brown Berets\", a group with roots in the high school student movement that staged walkouts in 1968, known as the East L.A. walkouts, also called \"blowouts\".\nThe best known historical fact of the Moratorium was the death of Rub\u00e9n Salazar, known for his reporting on civil rights and police brutality. The official story is that Salazar was killed by a tear gas canister fired by a member of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department into the Silver Dollar Caf\u00e9 at the conclusion of the National Chicano Moratorium March.\n\nEducation\nParental Involvement\nParents are commonly associated with being a child's first teacher. As the child grows older, the parent's role in their child's learning may change; however, a parent will often continue to serve as a role model. There are multiple research articles that have looked at parental involvement and education. A key aspect of parental involvement in education is that it can be transmitted in many ways. For a long time, there has been a misconception that the parents of Mexican American students are not involved in their children's education; however, multiple studies have demonstrated that parents are involved in their children's education (Valencia & Black, 2002). It is important to know that the parents of Mexican American students frequently display their involvement through untraditional methods; such as, consejos, home-base practices, and high academic expectations.\n\nLiterature has demonstrated that parental involvement has had a positive influence in the academic achievement of Mexican American students. Studies have shown that Mexican families show their value towards education by using untraditional methods (Kiyama, 2011). One educational practice that is commonly used among Mexican families are consejos (advice). Additional research has supported the idea that parents' consejos have had a significant influence on the education of Mexican American students. Espino (2016) studied the influence that parental involvement had on seven, 1st generation Mexican American PhDs. The study found that one of the participant's father would frequently use consejos to encourage his son to continue his education. The father's consejos served as an encouragement tool, which motivated the participant to continue his education. Consejos are commonly associated with the parents' occupation. Parents use their occupation as leverage to encourage their child to continue his or her education, or else they may end up working an undesirable job (Espino, 2016). While this might not be the most common form of parental involvement, studies have shown that it has been an effective tool that encourages Mexican American students. Although that might be an effective tool for Mexican American students, a mother can be just as an important figure for consejos. A mother's role teaches their child the importance of everyday tasks such as knowing how to cook, clean and care for oneself to be independent and also to help out around the house. The children of single mothers have a huge impact on their children in pushing them to be successful in school to have a better life than what they provided to their children. Most single mothers live in poverty and are dependent of the government, so they want the best for their children so they are always encouraging their children to be focused and do their best.\n\nAnother study emphasized the importance of home-based parental involvement. Altschul (2011) conducted a study that tested the effects of six different types of parental involvement and their effect on Mexican American students. The study used previous data from the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS) of 1988. The data was used to evaluate the influence of parental practices in the 8th grade and their effect on students once they were in the 10th grade. Altschul (2011) noted that home-based parental involvement had a more positive effect on the academic achievement of Mexican American students, than involvement in school organizations. The literature suggests that parental involvement in the school setting is not necessary, parents can impact the academic achievement of their children from their home.\nAdditional literature has demonstrated that parent involvement also comes in the form of parent expectations. Valencia and Black (2002) argued that Mexican parents place a significant amount of value on education and hold high expectations for their children. The purpose of their study was to debunk the notion that Mexicans do not value education by providing evidence that shows the opposite. Setting high expectations and expressing their desire for their children to be academically successful has served as powerful tools to increase of the academic achievement among Mexican American students (Valencia & Black, 2002). Keith and Lichtman (1995) also conducted a research study that measured the influence of parental involvement and academic achievement. The data was collected from the NELS and used a total of 1,714 students that identified as Mexican American (Chicana\/o). The study found a higher level of academic achievement among 8th grade Mexican American students and parents who had high educational aspirations for their children (Keith & Lichtman, 1995).\n\nAdditional research done by Carranza, You, Chhuon, and Hudley (2009) added support to the idea that high parental expectations were associated with higher achievement levels among Mexican American students. Carranza et al. (2009) studied 298 Mexican American high school students. They studied whether perceived parental involvement, acculturation, and self-esteem had any effect on academic achievement and aspirations. Results from their study demonstrated that perceived parental involvement had an influence on the students' academic achievement and aspirations. Additionally, Carranza et al. noted that among females, those who perceived that their parents expected them to get good grades tended to study more and have higher academic aspirations (2009). The findings suggest that parental expectations can affect the academic performance of Mexican American students.\nBased on current literature, one can conclude that parental involvement is an extremely important aspect of Mexican American students' education. The studies demonstrated that parental involvement is not limited to participating in school activities at the school; instead, parental involvement can be displayed through various forms. There are numerous studies that suggest that parental expectations are associated with the achievement level of Mexican American students. Future research should continue to study the reasons why Mexican American students perform better when their parents expect them to do well in school.

The National Film Board said that it was \"one of the most popular of a new wave of narrative feature films produced in the 1980s by Latino filmmakers\" and that it \"celebrates in a direct, approachable, and impactful way, values of self-betterment through hard work and power through knowledge.\"\n\nMexican American communities\nLarge Mexican American populations by both size and per capita exist in the following American counties, metropolitan areas, and cities:\n\nArizona\nPhoenix \u2013 Fifth-largest Mexican-American population.\nTucson \u2013 30% of the almost 1 million people in the metro area.\n\nCalifornia\nLos Angeles, California area \u2013 The city proper is home to over 1.2 million of Mexican ancestry, another 2.3 million throughout Los Angeles County, and a total of about 6.3 million in the five-county Greater Los Angeles Area.

The prevalence of diabetes in the United States is constantly rising. Common types of Diabetes are type 1 and type 2. Type 2 is the more common type of diabetes among Mexican Americans, and is constantly increasing due to poor diet habits. The increase of obesity results in an increase of type 2 diabetes among Mexican Americans in the United States. Mexican American men have higher prevalence rates in comparison to non-Latinos, whites and blacks. \"The prevalence of diabetes increased from 8.9% in 1976\u20131980 to 12.3% in 1988\u201394 among adults aged 40 to 74\" according to the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988\u20131994. In a 2014 study, The US Census Bureau estimates that by 2050, one in three people living in the United States will be of Latino origin including Mexican Americans. Type 2 diabetes prevalence is rising due to many risk factors and there are still many cases of pre-diabetes and undiagnosed diabetes due to lack of sources. According to the US Department of Health and Human Services (2011), individuals of Mexican descent are 50% more likely to die from diabetes than their white counterparts.\n\nNotable people\nSee also\nAmericans\nMexicans\nIndigenous Mexican Americans\nMexico\u2013United States barrier\nMigrant deaths along the Mexico\u2013United States border\nAmerican immigration to Mexico\nMexico\u2013United States relations\nHyphenated American\nEmigration from Mexico\nHistory of Mexican Americans in Los Angeles\nHistory of Mexican Americans in Texas\nHistory of Mexican Americans in Dallas\u2013Fort Worth\nHistory of Mexican Americans in Houston\nHistory of Mexican Americans in Metro Detroit\nMexicans in Chicago\nHistory of Mexican Americans in Tucson\nEthnic:\n\nMelting pot (metaphor for cultural fusion)\nIndigenous peoples of the Americas\nWhite Hispanic and Latino Americans\nWhite Mexicans\nOlive skin\nMestizo\nBronze (racial classification)\nBrown (racial classification)\nLa raza c\u00f3smica\nAfro-Mexicans\nPolitical:\n\nReconquista (Mexico)\nTexan raids on New Mexico (1843)\nCultural:\n\nChicanismo\nChicano poetry\nList of Mexican-American writers\nEl Pueblo de Los \u00c1ngeles Historical Monument\nCholo (subculture)\nMexican cuisine\nTex-Mex\nMexican-American cuisine\nZoot suit, a clothing fad in 1940s\nFilm:\n\nA Better Life\nCesar Chavez (film)\nFools Rush In (1997 film)\nFrom Prada to Nada\nLa Bamba (film)\nLowriders (film)\nMcFarland, USA\nSpare Parts (2015 film)\nThe Long Game (film)\nTortilla Soup\n\nReferences\nBibliography\/further reading\nDolan, Jay P., and Gilberto M.

It tells the story of an aspiring actress named Betty Elms (Watts), newly arrived in Los Angeles, who meets and befriends an amnesiac woman (Harring) recovering from a car accident. The story follows several other vignettes and characters, including a Hollywood film director (Theroux).\nThe American-French co-production was originally conceived as a television pilot, and a large portion of the film was shot in 1999 with Lynch's plan to keep it open-ended for a potential series. After viewing Lynch's cut, however, television executives rejected it. Lynch then provided an ending to the project, making it a feature film. The half-pilot, half-feature result, along with Lynch's characteristic surrealist style, has left the general meaning of the film's events open to interpretation. Lynch has declined to offer an explanation of his intentions for the narrative, leaving audiences, critics, and cast members to speculate on what transpires. He gave the film the tagline \"A love story in the city of dreams\".\nMulholland Drive earned Lynch the Prix de la mise en sc\u00e8ne (Best Director Award) at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival, sharing the prize with Joel Coen for The Man Who Wasn't There. Lynch also earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Director. The film boosted Watts' Hollywood profile considerably, and was the last feature film to star veteran Hollywood actress Ann Miller.\nMulholland Drive is often regarded as one of Lynch's finest works and as one of the greatest films of all time. It was ranked 8th in the 2022 Sight & Sound critics' poll of the best films ever made and topped a 2016 BBC poll of the best films since 2000.\n\nPlot\nA woman is about to be shot by her limousine chauffeur on Mulholland Drive, but is saved when a car crashes into them. The woman is the sole survivor but is dazed, and hides in an apartment when the occupant leaves with suitcases. Aspiring actress Betty Elms arrives at the apartment, loaned by her aunt, and finds the woman. The woman confides she has amnesia and is in danger, and dons the name \"Rita\" from a Gilda poster. The two discover a large quantity of cash and a blue key in Rita's purse.\nAt a Winkie's diner, a man tells his companion about his recurring nightmare of the restaurant, saying it is caused by a horrific figure hiding in the alley behind. Noticing similarities to his nightmare, the man and his companion investigate behind the diner. The figure appears, causing the man to collapse in shock.\nDirector Adam Kesher is threatened by mobsters, forced to cast unknown actress Camilla Rhodes as his film lead. When Kesher refuses, the mobsters remove his line of credit and the studio shuts down production. Kesher discovers his wife's infidelity, and is kicked out of their home by her lover. Kesher is pressured to meet a cowboy, who strongly urges him to cast Camilla for his own good. Elsewhere, a bungling hitman leaves three people dead in an attempt to steal a book of phone numbers.\nWhile at Winkie's investigating Rita's identity, the waitress's nametag causes Rita to remember the name \"Diane Selwyn\"; they call Diane's number, but there is no answer. Betty leaves Rita to attend an audition, and is shown around by a casting agent. Betty enters Adam's soundstage, where he is auditioning for The Sylvia North Story. Betty and Adam lock eyes, but Betty flees the set after recalling her promise to meet Rita. Adam casts Camilla Rhodes at her audition, to the delight of the studio. \nBetty and Rita go to Diane Selwyn's apartment complex, but the occupant explains she is Diane's neighbor and they recently swapped apartments. Breaking into Diane's new apartment, Betty and Rita discover a woman's decomposing corpse, horrifying Rita. Rita emotionally attempts to cut her hair off, but Betty persuades her to don a similar blonde wig. Later that night, the two have sex. At 2 a.m., Rita awakens from a nightmare while chanting \"Silencio\" and insists that the two go to Club Silencio.\nAt Club Silencio, the emcee explains that everything is an illusion, and the women soon cry to Rebekah del Rio's Spanish rendition of \"Crying\"; the performer collapses but the singing continues, revealing audio to be a playback recording. Betty discovers a blue box matching the key in her purse, and the two women return home. Rita retrieves the key, but finds Betty has vanished; unlocking the box, Rita vanishes too and the box falls to the floor. The apartment owner, seen leaving in the opening, investigates the noise but finds nothing.\nDiane Selwyn, a depressed and struggling actress resembling Betty, awakens in the apartment Betty and Rita investigated. Diane's neighbor shows up to claim her old possessions, and warns that detectives have asked for Diane's whereabouts. Diane has fantasies about her past relationship with Camilla Rhodes, a successful actress who looks like Rita. Despite Diane's investment in the relationship, Camilla breaks up with Diane.\nAt Camilla's behest, Diane attends a party at Adam's house on Mulholland Drive. Diane explains to the partygoers, who all resemble people seen previously, that she moved from Canada after inheriting cash from her aunt. Diane met Camilla on The Sylvia North Story, and they became friends despite Diane losing the leading role to her. Camilla kisses and whispers about Diane to the \"Camilla Rhodes\" Adam cast earlier, angering Diane. Adam and Camilla prepare to make a joint announcement (suggesting they are getting married) as Diane shakes with rage.\nAt Winkie's, Diane meets the hitman and hires him to kill Camilla, who explains he will leave a blue key to signal completion. In her apartment, a traumatized Diane stares at the blue key on her coffee table. Terrorised by hallucinations, Diane runs into her room and shoots herself. At Club Silencio, a blue-haired woman whispers \"Silencio\".\n\nCast\nThemes and interpretations\nGiving the film only the tagline \"A love story in the city of dreams\", David Lynch has refused to comment on Mulholland Drive's meaning or symbolism, leading to much discussion and multiple interpretations. The Christian Science Monitor film critic David Sterritt spoke with Lynch after the film screened at Cannes and wrote that the director \"insisted that Mulholland Drive does tell a coherent, comprehensible story\", unlike some of Lynch's earlier films like Lost Highway. On the other hand, Justin Theroux said of Lynch's feelings on the multiple meanings people perceive in the film, \"I think he's genuinely happy for it to mean anything you want. He loves it when people come up with really bizarre interpretations. David works from his subconscious.\" The film was described as a neo-noir.\n\nDreams and alternative realities\nAn early interpretation of the film uses dream analysis to argue that the first part is a dream of the real Diane Selwyn, who has cast her dream-self as the innocent and hopeful \"Betty Elms\", reconstructing her history and persona into something like an old Hollywood film. In the dream, Betty is successful, charming, and lives the fantasy life of a soon-to-be-famous actress. The last one-fifth of the film presents Diane's real life, in which she has failed both personally and professionally. She arranges for Camilla, an ex-lover, to be killed, and unable to cope with the guilt, re-imagines her as the dependent, pliable amnesiac Rita. Clues to her inevitable demise, however, continue to appear throughout her dream.\nThis interpretation was similar to what Naomi Watts construed, when she said in an interview, \"I thought Diane was the real character and that Betty was the person she wanted to be and had dreamed up. Rita is the damsel in distress and she's in absolute need of Betty, and Betty controls her as if she were a doll. Rita is Betty's fantasy of who she wants Camilla to be.\" Watts's own early experiences in Hollywood parallel those of Diane's. She endured some professional frustration before she became successful, auditioned for parts in which she did not believe, and encountered people who did not follow through with opportunities. She recalled, \"There were a lot of promises, but nothing actually came off. I ran out of money and became quite lonely.\" Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune found that \"everything in 'Mulholland Drive' is a nightmare. It's a portrayal of the Hollywood golden dream turning rancid, curdling into a poisonous stew of hatred, envy, sleazy compromise and soul-killing failure. This is the underbelly of our glamorous fantasies, and the area Lynch shows here is realistically portrayed\".\nThe Guardian asked six well-known film critics for their own perceptions of the overall meaning in Mulholland Drive. Neil Roberts of The Sun and Tom Charity of Time Out subscribe to the theory that Betty is Diane's projection of a happier life. Roger Ebert and Jonathan Ross seem to accept this interpretation, but both hesitate to overanalyze the film. Ebert states, \"There is no explanation. There may not even be a mystery.\" Ross observes that there are storylines that go nowhere: \"Perhaps these were leftovers from the pilot it was originally intended to be, or perhaps these things are the non-sequiturs and subconscious of dreams.\" Philip French from The Observer sees it as an allusion to Hollywood tragedy, while Jane Douglas from the BBC rejects the theory of Betty's life as Diane's dream, but also warns against too much analysis.\nMedia theorist Siobhan Lyons similarly disagrees with the dream theory, arguing that it is a \"superficial interpretation [which] undermines the strength of the absurdity of reality that often takes place in Lynch's universe\". Instead, Lyons posits that Betty and Diane are in fact two different people who happen to look similar, a common motif among Hollywood starlets. In a similar interpretation, Betty and Rita and Diane and Camilla may exist in parallel universes that sometimes interconnect. Another theory offered is that the narrative is a M\u00f6bius strip, a twisted band that has no beginning and no end. It was also suggested that the entire film takes place in a dream, yet the identity of the dreamer is unknown. Repeated references to beds, bedrooms and sleeping symbolize the heavy influence of dreams. Rita falls asleep several times; in between these episodes, disconnected scenes such as the men having a conversation at Winkie's, Betty's arrival in Los Angeles and the bungled hit take place, suggesting that Rita may be dreaming them. The opening shot of the film zooms into a bed containing an unknown sleeper, instilling, according to film scholar Ruth Perlmutter, the necessity to question the reality of following events. Professor of dream studies Kelly Bulkeley argues that the early scene at the diner, as the only one in which dreams or dreaming are explicitly mentioned, illustrates \"revelatory truth and epistemological uncertainty in Lynch's film\". The monstrous being from the dream, who is the subject of conversation of the men in Winkie's, reappears at the end of the film right before and after Diane commits suicide. Bulkeley asserts that the lone discussion of dreams in that scene presents an opening to \"a new way of understanding everything that happens in the movie\".\nPhilosopher and film theorist Robert Sinnerbrink similarly notes that the images following Diane's apparent suicide undermine the \"dream and reality\" interpretation. After Diane shoots herself, the bed is consumed with smoke, and Betty and Rita are shown beaming at each other, after which a woman in the Club Silencio balcony whispers \"Silencio\" as the screen fades to black. Sinnerbrink writes that the \"concluding images float in an indeterminate zone between fantasy and reality, which is perhaps the genuinely metaphysical dimension of the cinematic image\", also noting that it might be that the \"last sequence comprises the fantasy images of Diane's dying consciousness, concluding with the real moment of her death: the final Silencio\". Referring to the same sequence, film theorist Andrew Hageman notes that \"the ninety-second coda that follows Betty\/Diane's suicide is a cinematic space that persists after the curtain has dropped on her living consciousness, and this persistent space is the very theatre where the illusion of illusion is continually unmasked\".\nFilm theorist David Roche writes that Lynch films do not simply tell detective stories, but rather force the audience into the role of becoming detectives themselves to make sense of the narratives, and that Mulholland Drive, like other Lynch films, frustrates \"the spectator's need for a rational diegesis by playing on the spectator's mistake that narration is synonymous with diegesis\". In Lynch's films, the spectator is always \"one step behind narration\" and thus \"narration prevails over diegesis\". Roche also notes that there are multiple mysteries in the film that ultimately go unanswered by the characters who meet dead ends, like Betty and Rita, or give in to pressures as Adam does. Although the audience still struggles to make sense of the stories, the characters are no longer trying to solve their mysteries. Roche concludes that Mulholland Drive is a mystery film not because it allows the audience to view the solution to a question, but the film itself is a mystery that is held together \"by the spectator-detective's desire to make sense\" of it.\n\nA \"poisonous valentine to Hollywood\"\nDespite the proliferation of theories, critics note that no explanation satisfies all of the loose ends and questions that arise from the film. Stephen Holden of The New York Times writes, \"Mulholland Drive has little to do with any single character's love life or professional ambition. The movie is an ever-deepening reflection on the allure of Hollywood and on the multiple role-playing and self-invention that the movie-going experience promises ... What greater power is there than the power to enter and to program the dream life of the culture?\" J. Hoberman from The Village Voice echoes this sentiment by calling it a \"poisonous valentine to Hollywood\".\nMulholland Drive has been compared with Billy Wilder's film noir Sunset Boulevard (1950), another tale about broken dreams in Hollywood, and early in the film Rita is shown crossing Sunset Boulevard at night. Apart from both titles being named after iconic Los Angeles streets, Mulholland Drive is \"Lynch's unique account of what held Wilder's attention too: human putrefaction (a term Lynch used several times during his press conference at the New York Film Festival 2001) in a city of lethal illusions\". The title of the film is a reference to iconic Hollywood culture. Lynch lives near Mulholland Drive, and stated in an interview, \"At night, you ride on the top of the world. In the daytime you ride on top of the world, too, but it's mysterious, and there's a hair of fear because it goes into remote areas. You feel the history of Hollywood in that road.\" Watts also had experience with the road before her career was established: \"I remember driving along the street many times sobbing my heart out in my car, going, 'What am I doing here?'\"\nCritic Gregory Weight cautions viewers against a cynical interpretation of the events in the film, stating that Lynch presents more than \"the fa\u00e7ade and that he believes only evil and deceit lie beneath it\". As much as Lynch makes a statement about the deceit, manipulation and false pretenses in Hollywood culture, he also infuses nostalgia throughout the film and recognizes that real art comes from classic filmmaking as Lynch cast thereby paying tribute to veteran actors Ann Miller, Lee Grant and Chad Everett. He also portrays Betty as extraordinarily talented and shows that her abilities are noticed by powerful people in the entertainment industry. Commenting on the contrasting positions between film nostalgia and the putrefaction of Hollywood, Steven Dillon writes that Mulholland Drive is critical of the culture of Hollywood as much as it is a condemnation of \"cinephilia\" (the fascination of filmmaking and the fantasies associated with it).\nHarring described her interpretation after seeing the film: \"When I saw it the first time, I thought it was the story of Hollywood dreams, illusion and obsession. It touches on the idea that nothing is quite as it seems, especially the idea of being a Hollywood movie star. The second and third times I saw it, I thought it dealt with identity. Do we know who we are? And then I kept seeing different things in it ... There's no right or wrong to what someone takes away from it or what they think the film is really about. It's a movie that makes you continuously ponder, makes you ask questions. I've heard over and over, 'This is a movie that I'll see again' or 'This is a movie you've got to see again.' It intrigues you. You want to get it, but I don't think it's a movie to be gotten. It's achieved its goal if it makes you ask questions.\"\n\nRomantic content\nThe relationships between Betty and Rita, and Diane and Camilla have been variously described as \"touching\", \"moving\", as well as \"titillating\". The French critic Thierry Jousse, in his review for Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma, said that the love between the women depicted is \"of lyricism practically without equal in contemporary cinema\". In the pages of Film Comment, Phillip Lopate states that the pivotal romantic interlude between Betty and Rita was made poignant and tender by Betty's \"understanding for the first time, with self-surprise, that all her helpfulness and curiosity about the other woman had a point: desire ... It is a beautiful moment, made all the more miraculous by its earned tenderness, and its distances from anything lurid.\" Stephanie Zacharek of Salon magazine stated that the scene's \"eroticism [was] so potent it blankets the whole movie, coloring every scene that came before and every one that follows\". Betty and Rita were chosen by the Independent Film Channel as the emblematic romantic couple of the 2000s. Writer Charles Taylor said, \"Betty and Rita are often framed against darkness so soft and velvety it's like a hovering nimbus, ready to swallow them if they awake from the film's dream. And when they are swallowed, when smoke fills the frame as if the sulfur of hell itself were obscuring our vision, we feel as if not just a romance has been broken, but the beauty of the world has been cursed.\"\nSome film theorists have argued that Lynch inserts queerness in the aesthetic and thematic content of the film. The non-linear film is \"incapable of sustaining narrative coherence\", as Lee Wallace argues that, \"lesbianism dissolves the ideological conventions of narrative realism, operating as the switch point for the contesting storyworlds within Lynch's elaborately plotted film\". The presence of mirrors and doppelgangers throughout the film \"are common representations of lesbian desire\". The co-dependency in the relationship between Betty and Rita\u2014which borders on outright obsession\u2014has been compared to the female relationships in two similar films, Ingmar Bergman's Persona (1966) and Robert Altman's 3 Women (1977), which also depict identities of vulnerable women that become tangled, interchanging and ultimately merge: \"The female couples also mirror each other, with their mutual interactions conflating hero(ine) worship with same-sex desire\". Lynch pays direct homage to Persona in the scene where Rita dons the blonde wig, styled exactly like Betty's own hair. Rita and Betty then gaze at each other in the mirror \"drawing attention to their physical similarity, linking the sequence to theme of embrace, physical coupling and the idea of merging or doubling\". Mirroring and doubles, which are prominent themes throughout the film, serve to further queer the form and content of the film.\nSeveral theorists have accused Lynch of perpetuating stereotypes and clich\u00e9s of lesbians, bisexuals and lesbian relationships. Rita (the femme fatale) and Betty (the school girl) represent two classic stock lesbian characters; Heather Love identifies two key clich\u00e9s used in the film: \"Lynch presents lesbianism in its innocent and expansive form: lesbian desire appears as one big adventure, an entr\u00e9e into a glamorous and unknown territory\". Simultaneously, he presents the tragic lesbian triangle, \"in which an attractive but unavailable woman dumps a less attractive woman who is figured as exclusively lesbian\", perpetuating the stereotype of the bisexual \"ending up with a man\". Maria San Filippo recognizes that Lynch relies on classic film noir archetypes to develop Camilla's eventual betrayal: these archetypes \"become ingrained to such a degree that viewers are immediately cued that \"Rita\" is not what she seems and that it is only a matter of time before she reveals her duplicitous nature.\" For Love, Diane's exclusively lesbian desire is \"between success and failure, between sexiness and abjection, even between life and death\" if she is rejected. In this context the character of Diane may be interpreted as the \"tragic lesbian\" clich\u00e9 pining after the bisexual in the heterosexual relationship. Love's analysis of the film notes the media's peculiar response to the film's lesbian content: \"reviewers rhapsodized in particular and at length about the film's sex scenes, as if there were a contest to see who could enjoy this representation of female same-sex desire the most.\" She points out that the film used a classic theme in literature and film depicting lesbian relationships: Camilla as achingly beautiful and available, rejecting Diane for Adam. Popular reaction to the film suggests the contrasting relationships between Betty and Rita and Diane and Camilla are \"understood as both the hottest thing on earth and, at the same time, as something fundamentally sad and not at all erotic\" as \"the heterosexual order asserts itself with crushing effects for the abandoned woman\".\nHeterosexuality as primary is important in the latter half of the film, as the ultimate demise of Diane and Camilla's relationship springs from the matrimony of the heterosexual couple. At Adam's party, they begin to announce that Camilla and Adam are getting married; through laughs and kisses, the declaration is delayed because it is obvious and expected. The heterosexual closure of the scene is  interrupted by a scene change. As Lee Wallace suggests, by planning a hit against Camilla, \"Diane circumvents the heterosexual closure of the industry story but only by going over to its storyworld, an act that proves fatal for both women, the cause and effect relations of the thriller being fundamentally incompatible with the plot of lesbianism as the film presents it\".\nFor Joshua Bastian Cole,  Adam's character serves as Diane's foil, what she can never be, which is why Camilla leaves her. In her fantasy, Adam has his own subplot which leads to his humiliation. While this subplot can be understood as a revenge fantasy born from jealousy, Cole argues that this is an example of Diane's transgender gaze: \"Adam functions like a mirror \u2013 a male object upon which Diane might project herself\". Diane's prolonged eye-contact with Dan at Winkie's is another example of the trans gaze. For Cole, \"Diane's strange recognition of Dan, which is not quite identification but something else, feels trans in its oblique line, drawn between impossible doubles\" and their similar names (Dan\/Diane) which is no mistake. He stresses that the lesbian understanding of the film has overshadowed potential trans interpretations; his reading of Diane's trans gaze is a contribution to the queer narrative of the film.\nMedia portrayals of Naomi Watts's and Laura Elena Harring's views of their onscreen relationships were varied and conflicting. Watts said of the filming of the scene, \"I don't see it as erotic, though maybe it plays that way. The last time I saw it, I actually had tears in my eyes because I knew where the story was going. It broke my heart a little bit.\" However, in another interview Watts stated, \"I was amazed how honest and real all this looks on screen. These girls look really in love and it was curiously erotic.\" While Harring was quoted saying, \"The love scene just happened in my eyes. Rita's very grateful for the help Betty's given [her] so I'm saying goodbye and goodnight to her, thank you, from the bottom of my heart, I kiss her and then there's just an energy that takes us [over]. Of course I have amnesia so I don't know if I've done it before, but I don't think we're really lesbians.\" Heather Love agreed somewhat with Harring's perception when she stated that identity in Mulholland Drive is not as important as desire: \"who we are does not count for much\u2014what matters instead is what we are about to do, what we want to do.\"\n\nCharacters\nBetty Elms (Naomi Watts) is the bright and talented newcomer to Los Angeles, described as \"wholesome, optimistic, determined to take the town by storm\", and \"absurdly na\u00efve\". Her perkiness and intrepid approach to helping Rita because it is the right thing to do is reminiscent of Nancy Drew for reviewers. Her entire persona at first is an apparent clich\u00e9 of small-town na\u00efvet\u00e9. But it is Betty's identity, or loss of it, that appears to be the focus of the film. For one critic, Betty performed the role of the film's consciousness and unconscious. Watts, who modeled Betty on Doris Day, Tippi Hedren and Kim Novak, observed that Betty is a thrill-seeker, someone \"who finds herself in a world she doesn't belong in and is ready to take on a new identity, even if it's somebody else's\". This has also led one theorist to conclude that since Betty had na\u00efvely, yet eagerly entered the Hollywood system, she had become a \"complicit actor\" who had \"embraced the very structure that\" destroyed her. In an explanation of her development of the Betty character, Watts stated:\n\nI had to therefore come up with my own decisions about what this meant and what this character was going through, what was dream and what was reality. My interpretation could end up being completely different, from both David and the audience. But I did have to reconcile all of that, and people seem to think it works.\nBetty, however difficult to believe as her character is established, shows an astonishing depth of dimension in her audition. Previously rehearsed with Rita in the apartment, where Rita feeds her lines woodenly, the scene is \"dreck\" and \"hollow; every line unworthy of a genuine actress's commitment\", and Betty plays it in rehearsal as poorly as it is written. Nervous but plucky as ever at the audition, Betty enters the cramped room, but when pitted inches from her audition partner (Chad Everett), she turns it into a scene of powerful sexual tension that she fully controls and draws in every person in the room. The sexuality erodes immediately as the scene ends and she stands before them shyly waiting for their approval. One film analyst asserts that Betty's previously unknown ability steals the show, specifically, taking the dark mystery away from Rita and assigning it to herself, and by Lynch's use of this scene illustrates his use of deception in his characters. Betty's acting ability prompts Ruth Perlmutter to speculate if Betty is acting the role of Diane in either a dream or a parody of a film that ultimately turns against her.\nRita (Harring) is the mysterious and helpless apparent victim, a classic femme fatale with her dark, strikingly beautiful appearance. Roger Ebert was so impressed with Harring that he said of her \"all she has to do is stand there and she is the first good argument in 55 years for a Gilda remake\". She serves as the object of desire, directly oppositional to Betty's bright self-assuredness. She is also the first character with whom the audience identifies, and as viewers know her only as confused and frightened, not knowing who she is and where she is going, she represents their desire to make sense of the film through her identity. Instead of threatening, she inspires Betty to nurture, console and help her. Her amnesia makes her a blank persona, which one reviewer notes is \"the vacancy that comes with extraordinary beauty and the onlooker's willingness to project any combination of angelic and devilish onto her\". A character analysis of Rita asserts that her actions are the most genuine of the first portion of the film, since she has no memory and nothing to use as a frame of reference for how to behave. Todd McGowan, however, author of a book on themes in Lynch's films, states that the first portion of Mulholland Drive can be construed as Rita's fantasy, until Diane Selwyn is revealed; Betty is the object that overcomes Rita's anxiety about her loss of identity. According to film historian Steven Dillon, Diane transitions a former roommate into Rita: following a tense scene where the roommate collects her remaining belongings, Rita appears in the apartment, smiling at Diane.\n\nAfter Betty and Rita find the decomposing body, they flee the apartment and their images are split apart and reintegrated. David Roche notes that Rita's lack of identity causes a breakdown that \"occurs not only at the level of the character but also at the level of the image; the shot is subjected to special effects that fragment their image and their voices are drowned out in reverb, the camera seemingly writing out the mental state of the characters\". Immediately they return to Betty's aunt's apartment where Rita dons a blonde wig\u2014ostensibly to disguise herself\u2014but making her look remarkably like Betty. It is this transformation that one film analyst suggests is the melding of both identities. This is supported by visual clues, like particular camera angles making their faces appear to be merging into one. This is further illustrated soon after by their sexual intimacy, followed by Rita's personality becoming more dominant as she insists they go to Club Silencio at 2 a.m., that eventually leads to the total domination by Camilla.\nDiane Selwyn (Watts) is the palpably frustrated and depressed woman, who seems to have ridden the coattails of Camilla, whom she idolizes and adores, but who does not return her affection. She is considered to be the reality of the too-good-to-be-true Betty, or a later version of Betty after living too long in Hollywood. For Steven Dillon, the plot of the film \"makes Rita the perfect empty vessel for Diane's fantasies\", but because Rita is only a \"blank cover girl\" Diane has \"invested herself in emptiness\", which leads her to depression and apparently to suicide. Hence, Diane is the personification of dissatisfaction, painfully illustrated when she is unable to climax while masturbating, in a scene that indicates \"through blurred, jerky, point of view shots of the stony wall\u2014not only her tears and humiliation but the disintegration of her fantasy and her growing desire for revenge\". One analysis of Diane suggests her devotion to Camilla is based on a manifestation of narcissism, as Camilla embodies everything Diane wants and wants to be. Although she is portrayed as weak and the ultimate loser, for Jeff Johnson, author of a book about morality in Lynch films, Diane is the only character in the second portion of the film whose moral code remains intact. She is \"a decent person corrupted by the miscellaneous miscreants who populate the film industry\". Her guilt and regret are evident in her suicide, and in the clues that surface in the first portion of the film. Rita's fear, the dead body and the illusion at Club Silencio indicate that something is dark and wrong in Betty and Rita's world. In becoming free from Camilla, her moral conditioning kills her.\nCamilla Rhodes (Melissa George, Laura Elena Harring) is little more than a face in a photo and a name that has inspired many representatives of some vaguely threatening power to place her in a film against the wishes of Adam. Referred to as a \"vapid moll\" by one reviewer, she barely makes an impression in the first portion of the film, but after the blue box is opened and she is portrayed by Harring, she becomes a full person who symbolizes \"betrayal, humiliation and abandonment\", and is the object of Diane's sexual obsession and frustration. Diane is a sharp contrast to Camilla, who is more voluptuous than ever, and who appears to have \"sucked the life out of Diane\". Immediately after telling Diane that \"she drives her wild\", Camilla tells her they must end their affair. On a film set where Adam is directing Camilla, he orders the set cleared, except for Diane\u2014at Camilla's request\u2014where Adam shows another actor just how to kiss Camilla correctly. Instead of punishing Camilla for such public humiliation, as is suggested by Diane's conversation with the bungling hit man, one critic views Rita as the vulnerable representation of Diane's desire for Camilla.\nAdam Kesher (Justin Theroux) is established in the first portion of the film as a \"vaguely arrogant\", but apparently successful, director who endures one humiliation after another. Theroux said of his role, \"He's sort of the one character in the film who doesn't know what the [hell's] going on. I think he's the one guy the audience says, 'I'm kind of like you right now. I don't know why you're being subjected to all this pain.'\" After being stripped of creative control of his film, he is cuckolded by the pool cleaner (played by Billy Ray Cyrus), and thrown out of his own opulent house above Hollywood. After he checks into a seedy motel and pays with cash, the manager arrives to tell him that his credit is no good. Witnessed by Diane, Adam is pompous and self-important. He is the only character whose personality does not seem to change completely from the first part of the film to the second. One analysis of Adam's character contends that because he capitulated and chose Camilla Rhodes for his film, that is the end of Betty's cheerfulness and ability to help Rita, placing the blame for her tragedy on the representatives of studio power. Another analysis suggests that \"Adam Kesher does not have the control, he wants and is willing to step over who or what is necessary to consolidate his career. Hungry for power, he uses the appearance of love or seduction only as one more tool. Love for power justifies that everything else is forgotten, be it pride, love or any other consideration. There are no regrets, it is Mulholland Drive in Los Angeles.\"\nMinor characters include The Cowboy (Monty Montgomery), the Castigliani Brothers (Dan Hedaya and Angelo Badalamenti) and Mr. Roque (Michael J. Anderson), all of whom are somehow involved in pressuring Adam to cast Camilla Rhodes in his film. These characters represent the death of creativity for film scholars, and they portray a \"vision of the industry as a closed hierarchical system in which the ultimate source of power remains hidden behind a series of representatives\". Ann Miller portrays Coco, the landlady who welcomes Betty to her wonderful new apartment. Coco, in the first part of the film, represents the old guard in Hollywood, who welcomes and protects Betty. In the second part of the film, however, she appears as Adam's mother, who impatiently chastises Diane for being late to the party and barely pays attention to Diane's embarrassed tale of how she got into acting.\n\nStyle\nThe filmmaking style of David Lynch has been written about extensively using descriptions like \"ultraweird\", \"dark\" and \"oddball\". Todd McGowan writes, \"One cannot watch a Lynch film the way one watches a standard Hollywood film noir nor in the way that one watches most radical films.\" Through Lynch's juxtaposition of clich\u00e9 and surreal, nightmares and fantasies, nonlinear story lines, camera work, sound and lighting, he presents a film that challenges viewers to suspend belief of what they are experiencing. Many of the characters in Mulholland Drive are archetypes that can only be perceived as clich\u00e9: the new Hollywood hopeful, the femme fatale, the maverick director and shady powerbrokers that Lynch never seems to explore fully. Lynch places these often hackneyed characters in dire situations, creating dream-like qualities. By using these characters in scenarios that have components and references to dreams, fantasies and nightmares, viewers are left to decide, between the extremes, what is reality. One film analyst, Jennifer Hudson, writes of him, \"Like most surrealists, Lynch's language of the unexplained is the fluid language of dreams.\"\nDavid Lynch uses various methods of deception in Mulholland Drive. A shadowy figure named Mr. Roque, who seems to control film studios, is portrayed by dwarf actor Michael J. Anderson (also from Twin Peaks). Anderson, who has only two lines and is seated in an enormous wooden wheelchair, was fitted with oversized foam prosthetic arms and legs in order to portray his head as abnormally small. During Adam and Camilla's party, Diane watches Camilla (played by Harring) with Adam on one arm, lean over and deeply kiss the same woman who appeared as Camilla (Melissa George) before the blue box was opened. Both then turn and smile pointedly at Diane. Film critic Franklin Ridgway writes that the depiction of such a deliberate \"cruel and manipulative\" act makes it unclear if Camilla is as capricious as she seems, or if Diane's paranoia is allowing the audience only to see what she senses. In a scene immediately after Betty's audition, the film cuts to a woman singing without apparent accompaniment, but as the camera pulls backwards, the audience sees that it is a recording studio. In actuality, it is a sound stage where Betty has just arrived to meet Adam Kesher, that the audience realizes as the camera pulls back further. Ridgway insists that such deception through artful camera work sets the viewer full of doubt about what is being presented: \"It is as if the camera, in its graceful fluidity of motion, reassures us that it (thinks it) sees everything, has everything under control, even if we (and Betty) do not.\"\nAccording to Stephen Dillon, Lynch's use of different camera positions throughout the film, such as hand-held points of view, makes the viewer \"identify with the suspense of the character in his or her particular space\", but that Lynch at moments also \"disconnects the camera from any particular point of view, thereby ungrounding a single or even a human perspective\" so that the multiple perspectives keep contexts from merging, significantly troubling \"our sense of the individual and the human\". Andrew Hageman similarly notes that the camera work in the film \"renders a very disturbing sense of place and presence\", such as the scene in Winkie's where the \"camera floats irregularly during the shot-reverse shot dialogue\" by which the \"spectator becomes aware that a set of normally objective shots have become disturbingly subjective\". Scholar Curt Hersey recognizes several avant-garde techniques used in the film including lack of transitions, abrupt transitions, motion speed, nontraditional camera movement, computer-generated imagery, nondiegetic images, nonlinear narration and intertextuality.\n\nThe first portion of the film that establishes the characters of Betty, Rita and Adam presents some of the most logical filmmaking of Lynch's career. The later part of the film that represents reality to many viewers, however, exhibits a marked change in cinematic effect that gives it a quality just as surreal as the first part. Diane's scenes feature choppier editing and dirtier lighting that symbolize her physical and spiritual impoverishment, which contrasts with the first portion of the film where \"even the plainest decor seems to sparkle\", Betty and Rita glow with light and transitions between scenes are smooth. Lynch moves between scenes in the first portion of the film by using panoramic shots of the mountains, palm trees and buildings in Los Angeles. In the darker part of the film, sound transitions to the next scene without a visual reference where it is taking place. At Camilla's party, when Diane is most humiliated, the sound of crashing dishes is heard that carries immediately to the scene where dishes have been dropped in the diner, and Diane is speaking with the hit man. Sinnerbrink also notes that several scenes in the film, such as the one featuring Diane's hallucination of Camilla after Diane wakes up, the image of the being from behind Winkie's after Diane's suicide, or the \"repetition, reversal and displacement of elements that were differently configured\" in the early portion of the film, creates the uncanny effect where viewers are presented with familiar characters or situations in altered times or locations. Similarly, Hageman has identified the early scene at Winkie's as \"extremely uncanny\", because it is a scene where the \"boundaries separating physical reality from the imaginary realities of the unconscious disintegrate\". Author Valtteri Kokko has identified three groups of \"uncanny metaphors\"; the doppelg\u00e4nger of multiple characters played by the same actors, dreams and an everyday object\u2014primarily the blue box\u2014that initiates Rita's disappearance and Diane's real life.\nAnother recurring element in Lynch's films is his experimentation with sound. He stated in an interview, \"you look at the image and the scene silent, it's doing the job it's supposed to do, but the work isn't done. When you start working on the sound, keep working until it feels correct. There's so many wrong sounds and instantly you know it. Sometimes it's really magical.\" In the opening scene of the film, as the dark-haired woman stumbles off Mulholland Drive, silently it suggests she is clumsy. After Lynch added \"a hint of the steam [from the wreck] and the screaming kids\", however, it transformed Laura Elena Harring from clumsy to terrified. Lynch also infused subtle rumblings throughout portions of the film that reviewers noted added unsettling and creepy effects. Hageman also identifies \"perpetual and uncanny ambient sound\", and places a particular emphasis on the scene where the man collapses behind Winkie's as normal sound is drowned out by a buzzing roar, noting that the noise \"creates a dissonance and suspense that draws in the spectator as detective to place the sound and reestablish order\". Mulholland Drive's ending with the woman at Club Silencio whispering is an example of Lynch's aural deception and surreality, according to Ruth Perlmutter, who writes, \"The acting, the dreams, the search for identity, the fears and terrors of the undefined self are over when the film is over, and therefore, there is only silence and enigma.\"\n\nProduction\nDevelopment\nOriginally conceived as a television series, Mulholland Drive began as a 90-minute pilot produced for Touchstone Television and intended for the ABC television network. Tony Krantz, the agent who was responsible for the development of Twin Peaks, was \"fired up\" about doing another television series. Lynch sold the idea to ABC executives based only on the story of Rita emerging from the car accident with her purse containing $125,000 in cash and the blue key, and Betty trying to help her figure out who she is. An ABC executive recalled, \"I remember the creepiness of this woman in this horrible, horrible crash, and David teasing us with the notion that people are chasing her. She's not just 'in' trouble\u2014she is trouble. Obviously, we asked, 'What happens next?' And David said, 'You have to buy the pitch for me to tell you.'\" Lynch showed ABC a rough cut of the pilot. The person who saw it, according to Lynch, was watching it at six in the morning and was having coffee and standing up. He hated the pilot, and ABC immediately cancelled it. Pierre Edleman, Lynch's friend from Paris, came to visit and started talking to him about the film being a feature. Edleman went back to Paris. Canal+ wanted to give Lynch money to make it into a feature and it took a year to negotiate.\nLynch described the attractiveness of the idea of a pilot, despite the knowledge that the medium of television would be constricting: \"I'm a sucker for a continuing story ... Theoretically, you can get a very deep story and you can go so deep and open the world so beautifully, but it takes time to do that.\" The story included surreal elements, much like Lynch's earlier series Twin Peaks. Groundwork was laid for story arcs, such as the mystery of Rita's identity, Betty's career and Adam Kesher's film project.\nActress Sherilyn Fenn stated in a 2014 interview that the original idea came during the filming of Twin Peaks, as a spin-off film for her character of Audrey Horne.\n\nCasting\nLynch cast Naomi Watts and Laura Harring by their photographs. He called them in separately for half-hour interviews and told them that he had not seen any of their previous works in film or television. Harring considered it fateful that she was involved in a minor car accident on the way to the first interview, only to learn her character would also be involved in a car accident in the film. Watts arrived wearing jeans for the first interview, direct from the airplane from New York City. Lynch asked her to return the next day \"more glammed up\". She was offered the part two weeks later. Lynch explained his selection of Watts, \"I saw someone that I felt had a tremendous talent, and I saw someone who had a beautiful soul, an intelligence\u2014possibilities for a lot of different roles, so it was a beautiful full package.\" Justin Theroux also met Lynch directly after his airplane flight. After a long flight with little sleep, Theroux arrived dressed all in black, with untidy hair. Lynch liked the look and decided to cast Adam wearing similar clothes and the same hairstyle.\n\nFilming\nFilming for the television pilot began on location in Los Angeles in February 1999 and took six weeks. Ultimately, the network was unhappy with the pilot and decided not to place it on its schedule. Objections included the nonlinear storyline, the ages of Harring and Watts (whom they considered too old), cigarette smoking by Ann Miller's character and a close-frame shot of dog feces in one scene. Lynch remembered, \"All I know is, I loved making it, ABC hated it, and I don't like the cut I turned in. I agreed with ABC that the longer cut was too slow, but I was forced to butcher it because we had a deadline, and there wasn't time to finesse anything. It lost texture, big scenes and storylines, and there are 300 tape copies of the bad version circulating around. Lots of people have seen it, which is embarrassing, because they're bad-quality tapes, too. I don't want to think about it.\"\n\nThe script was later rewritten and expanded when Lynch decided to transform it into a feature film. Describing the transition from an open-ended pilot to a feature film with a resolution of sorts, Lynch said, \"One night, I sat down, the ideas came in, and it was a most beautiful experience. Everything was seen from a different angle ... Now, looking back, I see that [the film] always wanted to be this way. It just took this strange beginning to cause it to be what it is.\" The result was an extra eighteen pages of material that included the romantic relationship between Rita and Betty and the events that occurred after the blue box was opened. Watts was relieved that the pilot was dropped by ABC. She found Betty too one-dimensional without the darker portion of the film that was put together afterward. Most of the new scenes were filmed in October 2000, funded with $7 million from French production company StudioCanal.\nTheroux described approaching filming without entirely understanding the plot: \"You get the whole script, but he might as well withhold the scenes you're not in, because the whole turns out to be more mystifying than the parts. David welcomes questions, but he won't answer any of them ... You work kind of half-blindfolded. If he were a first-time director and hadn't demonstrated any command of this method, I'd probably have reservations. But it obviously works for him.\" Theroux noted that the only answer Lynch did provide was that he was certain that Theroux's character, a Hollywood director, was not meant to be Lynch. Watts stated that she tried to bluff Lynch by pretending she had the plot figured out, and that he delighted in the cast's frustration.\n\"I'm not going to lie: I felt very vulnerable,\" Laura Harring said of filming the sex scene between Harring and Watts' characters. \"I was in my dressing room and was on the verge of tears. It's hard. There are a lot of people there ... Naomi and I were friends. It was pretty awkward.\"\n\nSoundtrack\nThe soundtrack of Mulholland Drive was supervised by Angelo Badalamenti, who collaborated on previous Lynch projects Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks. Badalamenti, who was nominated for awards from the American Film Institute (AFI) and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) for his work on the film, also has a cameo as an espresso aficionado and mobster.\nReviewers note that Badalamenti's ominous score, described as his \"darkest yet\", contributes to the sense of mystery as the film opens on the dark-haired woman's limousine, that contrasts with the bright, hopeful tones of Betty's first arrival in Los Angeles, with the score \"acting as an emotional guide for the viewer\". Film music journalist Daniel Schweiger remarks that Badalamenti's contribution to the score alternates from the \"nearly motionless string dread to noir jazz and audio feedback\", with \"the rhythms building to an explosion of infinite darkness.\" Badalamenti described a particular technique of sound design applied to the film, by which he would provide Lynch with multiple ten- to twelve-minute tracks at slow tempo, that they called \"firewood\", from which Lynch \"would take fragments and experiment with them resulting in a lot of film's eerie soundscapes.\"\nLynch uses two pop songs from the 1960s directly after one another, playing as two actresses are auditioning by lip synching them. According to an analyst of music used in Lynch films, Lynch's female characters are often unable to communicate through normal channels and are reduced to lip-synching or being otherwise stifled. Connie Stevens's \"Sixteen Reasons\" is the song being sung while the camera pans backwards to reveal several illusions, and Linda Scott's version of \"I've Told Ev'ry Little Star\" is the audition for the first Camilla Rhodes, that film scholar Eric Gans considers a song of empowerment for Betty. Originally written by Jerome Kern as a duet, sung by Linda Scott in this rendition by herself, Gans suggests it takes on a homosexual overtone in Mulholland Drive. Unlike \"Sixteen Reasons\", however, portions of \"I've Told Ev'ry Little Star\" are distorted to suggest \"a sonic split-identity\" for Camilla. When the song plays, Betty has just entered the sound stage where Adam is auditioning actresses for his film, and she sees Adam, locks eyes with him and abruptly flees after Adam has declared \"This is the girl\" about Camilla, thereby avoiding his inevitable rejection.\n\nAt the hinge of the film is a scene in an unusual late night theater called Club Silencio where a performer announces \"No hay banda (there is no band) ... but yet we hear a band\", variated between English, Spanish and French. Described as \"the most original and stunning sequence in an original and stunning film\", Rebekah Del Rio's Spanish a cappella rendition of \"Crying\", named \"Llorando\", is praised as \"show-stopping ... except that there's no show to stop\" in the sparsely attended Club Silencio. Lynch wanted to use Roy Orbison's version of \"Crying\" in Blue Velvet, but changed his mind when he heard Orbison's \"In Dreams\". Del Rio, who popularized the Spanish version and who received her first recording contract on the basis of the song, stated that Lynch flew to Nashville where she was living, and she sang the song for him once and did not know he was recording her. Lynch wrote a part for her in the film and used the version she sang for him in Nashville. The song tragically serenades the lovers Betty and Rita, who sit spellbound and weeping, moments before their relationship disappears and is replaced by Diane and Camilla's dysfunction. According to one film scholar, the song and the entire theater scene marks the disintegration of Betty's and Rita's personalities, as well as their relationship. With the use of multiple languages and a song to portray such primal emotions, one film analyst states that Lynch exhibits his distrust of intellectual discourse and chooses to make sense through images and sounds. The disorienting effect of the music playing although del Rio is no longer there is described as \"the musical version of Magritte's painting Ceci n'est pas une pipe\".\n\nRelease\nMulholland Drive premiered at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival in May to major critical acclaim. Lynch was awarded the Best Director prize at the festival, sharing it with co-winner Joel Coen for The Man Who Wasn't There. It drew positive reviews from many critics and some of the strongest audience reactions of Lynch's career.\nThe film was publicized with cryptic posters bearing the abbreviation \"Mulholland Dr.\"\n\nBox office\nUniversal Pictures released Mulholland Drive theatrically in 66 theaters in the United States on October 12, 2001, grossing $587,591 over its opening weekend. It eventually expanded to its widest release of 247 theaters, ultimately grossing $7,220,243 at the U.S. box office. TVA Films released the film theatrically in Canada on October 26, 2001. In other territories outside the United States, the film grossed $12,897,096, for a worldwide total of $20,117,339 on the film's original release, plus much smaller sums on later re-releases.\n\nReception and legacy\nSince its release, Mulholland Drive has received \"both some of the harshest epithets and some of the most lavish praise in recent cinematic history\". On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 84% based on 262 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8\/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"David Lynch's dreamlike and mysterious Mulholland Drive is a twisty neo-noir with an unconventional structure that features a mesmerizing performance from Naomi Watts as a woman on the dark fringes of Hollywood.\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 87 out of 100 based on 37 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, who had often been dismissive of Lynch's work, awarded the film four stars out of four, writing, \"David Lynch has been working toward Mulholland Drive all of his career, and now that he's arrived there I forgive him for Wild at Heart and even Lost Highway. At last his experiment doesn't shatter the test tubes. The movie is a surrealist dreamscape in the form of a Hollywood film noir, and the less sense it makes, the more we can't stop watching it\". In The New York Times, Stephen Holden wrote that the film \"ranks alongside Fellini's 8\u00bd and other auteurist fantasias as a monumental self-reflection\" and added: \"Looked at lightly, it is the grandest and silliest cinematic carnival to come along in quite some time ... on a more serious level, its investigation into the power of movies pierces a void from which you can hear the screams of a ravenous demon whose appetites can never be slaked.\" Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle called it \"exhilarating ... for its dreamlike images and fierce, frequently reckless imagination\" and added, \"there's a mesmerizing quality to its languid pace, its sense of foreboding and its lost-in-time atmosphere ... it holds us, spellbound and amused, for all of its loony and luscious, exasperating 146 minutes [and] proves that Lynch is in solid form\u2014and still an expert at pricking our nerves\".\nIn Rolling Stone, Peter Travers observed, \"Mulholland Drive makes movies feel alive again. This sinful pleasure is a fresh triumph for Lynch, and one of the best films of a sorry-ass year. For visionary daring, swooning eroticism and colors that pop like a whore's lip gloss, there's nothing like this baby anywhere.\" J. Hoberman of The Village Voice stated, \"This voluptuous phantasmagoria ... is certainly Lynch's strongest movie since Blue Velvet and maybe Eraserhead. The very things that failed him in the bad-boy rockabilly debacle of Lost Highway\u2014the atmosphere of free-floating menace, pointless transmigration of souls, provocatively dropped plot stitches, gimcrack alternate universes\u2014are here brilliantly rehabilitated.\" A. O. Scott of The New York Times wrote that, while some might consider the plot an \"offense against narrative order\", the film is \"an intoxicating liberation from sense, with moments of feeling all the more powerful for seeming to emerge from the murky night world of the unconscious\".\nMulholland Drive was not without its detractors. Rex Reed of The New York Observer said that it was the worst film he had seen in 2001, calling it \"a load of moronic and incoherent garbage\". In New York, Peter Rainer observed, \"Although I like it more than some of his other dreamtime freakfests, it's still a pretty moribund ride ... Lynch needs to renew himself with an influx of the deep feeling he has for people, for outcasts, and lay off the cretins and hobgoblins and zombies for a while.\" In The Washington Post, Desson Howe called it \"an extended mood opera, if you want to put an arty label on incoherence\". Todd McCarthy of Variety found much to praise\u2014\"Lynch cranks up the levels of bizarre humor, dramatic incident and genuine mystery with a succession of memorable scenes, some of which rank with his best\"\u2014but also noted, \"the film jumps off the solid ground of relative narrative coherence into Lynchian fantasyland ... for the final 45 minutes, Lynch is in mind-twisting mode that presents a form of alternate reality with no apparent meaning or logical connection to what came before. Although such tactics are familiar from Twin Peaks and elsewhere, the sudden switcheroo to head games is disappointing because, up to this point, Lynch had so wonderfully succeeded in creating genuine involvement.\" James Berardinelli also criticized it, saying: \"Lynch cheats his audience, pulling the rug out from under us. He throws everything into the mix with the lone goal of confusing us. Nothing makes any sense because it's not supposed to make any sense. There's no purpose or logic to events. Lynch is playing a big practical joke on us.\" Film theorist Ray Carney notes, \"You wouldn't need all the emotional back-flips and narrative trap doors if you had anything to say. You wouldn't need doppelgangers and shadow-figures if your characters had souls.\"\nLater, Mulholland Drive was named the best film of the decade by the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma, IndieWire, Slant Magazine, Reverse Shot, The Village Voice and Time Out New York, who asked rhetorically in a reference to the September 11 attacks, \"Can there be another movie that speaks as resonantly\u2014if unwittingly\u2014to the awful moment that marked our decade? ... Mulholland Drive is the monster behind the diner; it's the self-delusional dream turned into nightmare.\" It was also voted best of the decade in a Film Comment poll of international \"critics, programmers, academics, filmmakers and others\", and by the magazine's readers. It appeared on lists among the ten best films of the decade, coming in third according to The Guardian, Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers, the Canadian Press, Access Hollywood critic Scott Mantz, and eighth on critic Michael Phillips's list. In 2010 it was named the second best arthouse film ever by The Guardian. The film was voted as the 11th best film set in Los Angeles in the last 25 years by a group of Los Angeles Times writers and editors with the primary criterion of communicating an inherent truth about the L.A. experience. Empire magazine placed Mulholland Drive at number 391 on their list of the five hundred greatest films ever. It has also been ranked number 38 on the Channel 4 program 50 Films to See Before You Die. In 2011, online magazine Slate named Mulholland Drive in its piece on \"New Classics\" as the most enduring film since 2000. Ebert added Mulholland Drive to his canon of \"Great Movies\": \"David Lynch loves movies, genres, archetypes and obligatory shots. Mulholland Drive employs the conventions of film noir in a pure form. One useful definition of noirs is that they're about characters who have committed a crime or a sin, are immersed with guilt, and fear they're getting what they deserve. Another is that they've done nothing wrong, but it nevertheless certainly appears as if they have. The second describes Hitchcock's favorite plot, the Innocent Man Wrongly Accused. The first describes the central dilemma of  Mulholland Dr. Yet it floats in an uneasy psychic space, never defining who sinned. The film evokes the feeling of noir guilt while never attaching to anything specific. A neat trick. Pure cinema.\"\nIn the British Film Institute's 2012 Sight & Sound poll, Mulholland Drive was ranked the 28th greatest film ever made, and in the 2022 poll, its ranking rose to 8th. Having received 40 critics' votes, it is one of only two films from the 21st century to be included in the list, along with 2000's In the Mood for Love. In a 2015 BBC poll, it was ranked 21st among all American films. The following year, Mulholland Drive was named as the greatest film of the 21st century in a poll conducted by BBC Culture. In July 2021, Mulholland Drive was shown in the Cannes Classics section at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nHome media\nThe film was released on VHS and DVD by Universal Studios Home Video on April 9, 2002, in the United States and Canada, with few special features. It was released without chapter stops, a feature that Lynch objects to on the grounds that it \"demystifies\" the film.\nNick Coccellato of Eccentric Cinema gave the film a rating of nine out of ten and the DVD release an eight out of ten, saying that the lack of special features \"only adds to the mystery the film itself possesses, in abundance\". Special features in later versions and overseas versions of the DVD include a Lynch interview at the Cannes Film Festival and highlights of the debut of the film at Cannes.\nOptimum Home Entertainment released Mulholland Drive to the European market on Blu-ray as part of its StudioCanal Collection on September 13, 2010. New special features exclusive to this release include: an introduction by Thierry Jousse; In the Blue Box, a retrospective documentary featuring directors and critics; two making-of documentaries: On the Road to Mulholland Drive and Back to Mulholland Drive, and several interviews with people involved in making the film. It is the second David Lynch film in this line of Blu-rays after The Elephant Man.\nOn July 15, 2015, The Criterion Collection announced that it would release Mulholland Drive, newly restored through a 4K digital transfer, on DVD and Blu-ray on October 27, 2015, both of which include new interviews with the film's crew and the 2005 edition of Chris Rodley's book Lynch on Lynch, along with the original trailer and other extras. It was Lynch's second film to receive a Criterion Collection release on DVD and Blu-ray, following Eraserhead which was released in September 2014. This Blu-ray\/DVD release was under the license from Focus Features and Universal Studios Home Entertainment.\nUniversal has seemingly lost the film's U.S. distribution rights since, which now lie with Janus Films, Criterion's parent company. On August 11, 2021, Criterion announced their first 4K Ultra HD releases, a six-film slate, will include Mulholland Drive. Criterion indicated each title will be available in a 4K UHD+Blu-ray combo pack including a 4K UHD disc of the feature film as well as the film and special features on the companion Blu-ray.  Criterion confirmed on August 16, 2021, that Mulholland Drive will be released on November 16, 2021, as a 4K and Blu-ray disc package.\n\nAwards and honors\nLynch was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Director for the film. From the Hollywood Foreign Press, the film received four Golden Globe nominations in the categories of Best Picture (Drama), Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Original Score. It was named Best Picture by the New York Film Critics Circle at the 2001 New York Film Critics Circle Awards and Online Film Critics Society.\n\nSee also\nList of films featuring miniature people\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nDillon, Steven (2006).

It was built by showman Earl Carroll and designed in the Streamline Moderne style by architect Gordon Kaufmann in 1938. The theatre has been known by a number of names since, including Moulin Rouge from 1953 to 1964 and the  Aquarius Theater in the 1960s and 1970s. From 1997 to 2017, it was officially known as Nickelodeon on Sunset (or Nick on Sunset), housing the West Coast production of live-action original series produced for the Nickelodeon cable channel.\nThe theater closed in 2017. In 2019, the building was leased for 10 years by a pair of theater operators who said they would restore and reopen the theater as part of a new entertainment complex.\n\nHistory\nEarly years\nThe Earl Carroll Theatre opened on December 26, 1938, with a lavish revue, \"Broadway to Hollywood,\" which featured sixty showgirls ascending 100 treads of stairs to a height of 135 feet. Many Hollywood celebrities were in attendance including Marlene Dietrich, Dolores del R\u00edo, the J. L. Warners, Richard Barthelmess, Sally Eilers, Edgar Bergen, Claudette Colbert, Constance Bennett, Errol Flynn, Lili Damita, William Gargan, Jackie Coogan, Betty Grable, Mary Livingstone, Phil Harris, Conrad Nagel, Mary Brian, Darryl Zanuck, David O. Selznick, and Norman Krasna. The $1,000 membership fee guaranteed a lifetime cover charge and a reserved seat.:\u200a40\u200a\nThe building was designed in the Moderne style by architect Gordon Kaufmann. The interior design is attributed to both Count Alexis de Sakhnoffsky and Frank Don Riha (1899\u20131957).:\u200a37\u200a As he had done at his New York theater, Carroll emblazoned over the entrance the words \"Through these portals pass the most beautiful girls in the world\". The theater-restaurant accommodated 1,200 diners :\u200a39\u200a and offered shows on a massive stage with a 60-foot (18 m) wide double revolving turntable and staircase and swings that could be lowered from the ceiling. The building's fa\u00e7ade was adorned by what at the time was one of Hollywood's most famous landmarks: a 20-foot-high (6.1 m) neon head portrait of entertainer Beryl Wallace, one of Earl Carroll's \"most beautiful girls in the world\", who became his devoted companion. The sign survived several changes of ownership and venue name but was completely removed during major decorative overhauling in 1968. A re-creation made from photos is today on display at Universal CityWalk, at Universal City, as part of the collection of historic neon signs from the Museum of Neon Art. Another prominent exterior feature was the \"Wall of Fame\", on which were mounted more than a hundred individual concrete blocks autographed by Hollywood celebrities, including some of the biggest stars of the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nThe Moderne-style interior was lavishly decorated with zeon (a variation of neon) tube lighting and artwork, some of which remains extant. In 1939, Life magazine described the new building: \"exhibits an ultramodern, super-streamlined interior with a patent-leather ceiling, 10,000 colored zeon lights, a 15-ft. statue, an acre of burgundy carpet.\" The centerpiece of the foyer was the Goddess of Light, a 15-foot-tall aluminum-covered plaster statue (extant) designed by Martin Deutsch. With hands lifted to the ceiling, the statue held a fifty-foot zeon tube that wound its way to the ceiling. The columns in the lobby bar (extant) were filled with zeon lamps and zeon stalactites hung from the ceiling in the cabaret. A large painting of Carroll painted by the artist Strandanees hung near the main entrance.:\u200a39\u200a\nLater achieving various degrees of fame in films and on television, Jean Spangler, Mara Corday, Yvonne De Carlo, Phyllis Coates, Maila Nurmi, Gloria Pall, Tyra Vaughn, and Mamie Van Doren were some of the showgirls who performed there. The facility was a popular night spot for many of Hollywood's most glamorous stars and powerful film industry moguls such as Darryl Zanuck and Walter Wanger, who sat on the Earl Carroll Theatre's board of governors.\nThe theater was sold following the 1948 deaths of Earl Carroll and Beryl Wallace in the crash of United Airlines Flight 624. It continued to operate but by the early 1950s, it was falling on hard times.\nIn 1953, Las Vegas showman Frank Sennes reopened the theater as a nightclub under the name Moulin Rouge. The popular TV contest show Queen for a Day was broadcast from the Moulin Rouge during part of the show's 1956\u20131964 run. The venue was also used for the 1965 concert film The Big TNT Show. In late 1965 it became the Hullabaloo, a rock and roll club for teenager to capitalize on the popularity of the musical variety show Hullabaloo. For several months in 1968 it was the Kaleidoscope and featured many top West Coast rock acts, with an emphasis on local bands such as The Doors.\nLater in 1968, the venue was renamed the Aquarius Theater and rededicated as the home of a long-running Los Angeles production of the Broadway musical Hair. It was accordingly redecorated in the psychedelic art style by the London-based Dutch design collective The Fool, which also created iconic late-1960s graphics for the Beatles, Cream with Eric Clapton, Procol Harum and other patrons. \nOn Mondays, when the Hair company had its day off, the theater was still sometimes used for rock concerts and the Aquarius consequently became famous for performances there by The Doors on July 21 & 22, 1969, the live recordings of which were later issued commercially.\nIn 1977, it was briefly known as the Longhorn Theatre and has also been called the Sunset Boulevard Theatre.\nIn 1983, the Pick-Vanoff Company purchased the property and converted it into a state-of-the-art television theater that for nine years was the taping site of Star Search. The Pick-Vanoff Company also owned Sunset-Gower Studios, formerly the home of Columbia Pictures. For many years, it was used for the annual Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon. In the fall of 1993, the theater was the venue for Fox Network's The Chevy Chase Show under the name The Chevy Chase Theater. The talk show was cancelled after five weeks; the theater reverted to its previous name soon after.\n\nNickelodeon on Sunset\nIn the mid-1990s, Nickelodeon decided to move production of some live-action series to the West Coast from Nickelodeon Studios in Orlando, Florida at Universal Studios. After scouting soundstages for a year, the network's headlining mover All That spent a year at Paramount Pictures before Nickelodeon obtained a lease for the 6238 Sunset Blvd facility, acquiring the soundstage and rebranding it Nickelodeon on Sunset by 1997. Due to limited studio space and the need to control plot spoilage for several programs, only a few series were taped at Nickelodeon on Sunset at a time. As a result, other live-action series produced for the network were filmed in other stage facilities with closed set policies throughout the Hollywood area.\nSome of the shows filmed there for Nickelodeon include all but the first 2 seasons of All That, The Amanda Show, Drake & Josh, and more recently iCarly and Victorious.\nIn 2004, the venue was sold to a private equity firm as part of a larger parcel of property. Nickelodeon moved out of the property in 2017.\n\nProductions\nAll That (1994\u20132005, Seasons 3\u201310)\nKenan & Kel (1996\u20132000, Seasons 3 & 4)\nThe Amanda Show (1999\u20132002)\nTaina (2001\u20132002, Season 2)\nThe Nick Cannon Show (2002\u20132003)\nR U All That?

In September 2016, the City Council also approved Palo Alto-based developer Essex Portfolio's proposal to construct a new mixed-use building on the western portion of the site of the theater building. The project will retain the historic building and incorporate new construction on the adjacent surface parking lot. The new development will be seven stories in height and linked to the theater building via a pedestrian paseo. The project calls for 4,700 square feet (440 m2) of ground floor commercial space, as well as 200 residential units. Ground was broken on October 17, 2017.\nOn September 25, 2019, Thaddeus Hunter Smith, a former owner of the nearby Fonda Theatre, and his business partner Brian Levian announced that they had signed a ten-year lease \"with the intention of not only restoring the building\u2019s original facilities, but also transforming the site into an entertainment complex, with spaces for concerts, stage shows, movie premieres, and other specialized events,\" The Architect's Newspaper reported.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nPhotographs: O'Connor, Pauline (October 23, 2017). \"Take a peek inside Hollywood's Earl Carroll Theatre\".

The city already has streets named after U.S. presidents, such as George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Woodrow Wilson, as well as a street named for Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2014the former \"Santa Barbara Avenue\", thus renamed, and commonly known since the early 1980s as \"King Boulevard\". Then-Senator Obama held a campaign rally at Rancho Cienega Park when running for his first term as president.\n\nCommercial\n\nThe former Rodeo Road's intersection with La Brea Avenue has been a commercial nexus since the mid-20th century, with the Baldwin Hills Shopping Center (not to be confused with the larger Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza indoor mall) opening in 1954 with anchors Safeway, Clark's Drug Store (later became Sav-On Drugs in 1995) and J. J. Newberry; today the anchor tenants are Ralphs supermarket and CVS Pharmacy. The La Cienega\u2013Rodeo Shopping Center had the Fedco warehouse club as an anchor, and is now anchored by Target. From the intersection of Obama and Crenshaw Boulevards, a commercial strip stretches down Crenshaw Boulevard to the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza.\n\n\n== References ==","165":"OCLC, Inc., doing business as OCLC, is an American nonprofit cooperative organization \"that provides shared technology services, original research, and community programs for its membership and the library community at large\". It was founded in 1967 as the Ohio College Library Center, then became the Online Computer Library Center as it expanded. In 2017, the name was formally changed to OCLC, Inc. OCLC and thousands of its member libraries cooperatively produce and maintain WorldCat, the largest online public access catalog in the world. OCLC is funded mainly by the fees that libraries pay (around $217.8 million annually in total as of 2021) for the many different services it offers. OCLC also maintains the Dewey Decimal Classification system.\n\nHistory\nOCLC began in 1967, as the Ohio College Library Center, through a collaboration of university presidents, vice presidents, and library directors who wanted to create a cooperative, computerized network for libraries in the state of Ohio. The group first met on July 5, 1967, on the campus of Ohio State University to sign the articles of incorporation for the nonprofit organization and hired Frederick G. Kilgour, a former Yale University medical school librarian, as first executive director.\nKilgour and Ralph H. Parker, who was the head of libraries at the University of Missouri, had proposed the shared cataloging system in a 1965 report as consultants to the Committee of Librarians of the Ohio College Association. Kilgour and Parker wished to merge the latest information storage and retrieval system of the time, the computer, with the oldest, the library. They were inspired in part by the earlier Columbia\u2013Harvard\u2013Yale Medical Libraries Computerization Project, an attempt at shared automated printing of catalog cards. The plan was to merge the catalogs of Ohio libraries electronically through a computer network and database to streamline operations, control costs, and increase efficiency in library management, bringing libraries together cooperatively to best serve researchers and scholars. The first library to do online cataloging through OCLC was the Alden Library at Ohio University on August 26, 1971. This was the first online cataloging by any library worldwide.\nBetween 1967 and 1977, OCLC membership was limited to institutions in Ohio, but in 1978, a new governance structure was established that allowed institutions from other states to join. In 2002, the governance structure was again modified to accommodate participation from outside the United States.\nAs OCLC expanded services in the United States outside Ohio, it relied on establishing strategic partnerships with \"networks\", organizations that provided training, support and marketing services. By 2008, there were 15 independent United States regional service providers. OCLC networks played a key role in OCLC governance, with networks electing delegates to serve on the OCLC Members Council. During 2008, OCLC commissioned two studies to look at distribution channels; at the same time, the council approved governance changes that had been recommended by the Board of Trustees severing the tie between the networks and governance. In early 2009, OCLC negotiated new contracts with the former networks and opened a centralized support center.\nIn July 2010, the company was sued by SkyRiver, a rival startup, in an antitrust suit. Library automation company Innovative Interfaces joined SkyRiver in the suit. The suit was dropped in March 2013, however, following the acquisition of SkyRiver by Innovative Interfaces.\nInnovative Interfaces was bought by ExLibris in 2020, therefore passing OCLC as the dominant supplier of ILS services in the US (over 70% market share for academic libraries and over 50% for public libraries for ExLibris, versus OCLC's 10% market share of both types of libraries in 2019).\nIn 2022, membership and governance expanded to include any institution with a subscription to one of many qualifying OCLC products (previously institutions qualified for membership by \"contributing intellectual content or participating in global resource or reference sharing\"), with the exception of for-profit organizations that are part of OCLC's partner program. This change reflected OCLC's expanding number of services due to its corporate acquisitions.\n\nPresidents\nThe following people served successively as president of OCLC:\n\n1967\u20131980: Frederick G. Kilgour\n1980\u20131989: Rowland C. W. Brown\n1989\u20131998: K.

WorldCat has holding records from public and private libraries worldwide.\nThe Online Computer Library Center acquired the trademark and copyrights associated with the Dewey Decimal Classification System when it bought Forest Press in 1988. A browser for books with their Dewey Decimal Classifications was available until July 2013; it was replaced by the Classify Service.\nUntil August 2009, when it was sold to Backstage Library Works, OCLC owned a preservation microfilm and digitization operation called the OCLC Preservation Service Center, with its principal office in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.\nStarting in 1971, OCLC produced catalog cards for members alongside its shared online catalog; the company printed its last catalog cards on October 1, 2015.\nQuestionPoint, an around-the-clock reference service provided to users by a cooperative of participating global libraries, was acquired by Springshare from OCLC in 2019 and migrated to Springshare's LibAnswers platform.\n\nSoftware\nOCLC commercially sells software, such as:\n\nCONTENTdm for managing digital collections\nWise, an integrated library system and \"community engagement system\"\nWorldCat Discovery, a bibliographic discovery system that allows library patrons to use a single search interface to access an institution's catalog, ebooks, database subscriptions and more\nWorldShare Management Services, an electronic resource management system\n\nResearch\nOCLC has been conducting research for the library community for more than 30 years. In accordance with its mission, OCLC makes its research outcomes known through various publications. These publications, including journal articles, reports, newsletters, and presentations, are available through the organization's website.\n\nOCLC Publications \u2013 Research articles from various journals including The Code4Lib Journal, OCLC Research, Reference and User Services Quarterly, College & Research Libraries News, Art Libraries Journal, and National Education Association Newsletter. The most recent publications are displayed first, and all archived resources, starting in 1970, are also available.\nMembership Reports \u2013 A number of significant reports on topics ranging from virtual reference in libraries to perceptions about library funding.\nNewsletters \u2013 Current and archived newsletters for the library and archive community.\nPresentations \u2013 Presentations from both guest speakers and OCLC research from conferences, webcasts, and other events. The presentations are organized into five categories: Conference presentations, Dewey presentations, Distinguished Seminar Series, Guest presentations, and Research staff presentations.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, OCLC participated in the REopening Archives, Libraries, and Museums (REALM) project funded by the IMLS to study the surface transmission risks of SARS-CoV-2 on common library and museum materials and surfaces, and published a series of reports.\n\nAdvocacy\nAdvocacy has been a part of OCLC's mission since its founding in 1967. OCLC staff members meet and work regularly with library leaders, information professionals, researchers, entrepreneurs, political leaders, trustees, students and patrons to advocate \"advancing research, scholarship, education, community development, information access, and global cooperation\".\nWebJunction, which provides training services to librarians, is a division of OCLC funded by grants from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation beginning in 2003.\nOCLC partnered with search engine providers in 2003 to advocate for libraries and share information across the Internet landscape. Google, Yahoo!, and Ask.com all collaborated with OCLC to make WorldCat records searchable through those search engines.\nOCLC's advocacy campaign \"Geek the Library\", started in 2009, highlights the role of public libraries. The campaign, funded by a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, uses a strategy based on the findings of the 2008 OCLC report, \"From Awareness to Funding: A study of library support in America\".\nOther past advocacy campaigns have focused on sharing the knowledge gained from library and information research. Such projects have included communities such as the Society of American Archivists, the Open Archives Initiative, the Institute for Museum and Library Services, the International Organization for Standardization, the National Information Standards Organization, the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Engineering Task Force, and Internet2. One of the most successful contributions to this effort was the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative, \"an open forum of libraries, archives, museums, technology organizations, and software companies who work together to develop interoperable online metadata standards that support a broad range of purposes and business models.\"\nOCLC has collaborated with the Wikimedia Foundation and the Wikimedia volunteer community, through integrating library metadata with Wikimedia projects, hosting a Wikipedian in residence, and doing a national training program through WebJunction called \"Wikipedia + Libraries: Better Together\".\n\nOnline database: WorldCat\nOCLC's WorldCat database is used by the general public and by librarians for cataloging and research. WorldCat is available to the public for searching via a subscription web-based service called FirstSearch, to which many libraries subscribe, as well as through the publicly available WorldCat.org.\n\nIdentifiers and linked data\nOCLC assigns a unique control number (referred to as an \"OCN\" for \"OCLC Control Number\") to each new bibliographic record in WorldCat. Numbers are assigned serially, and in mid-2013 over a billion OCNs had been created. In September 2013, the OCLC declared these numbers to be in the public domain, removing a perceived barrier to widespread use of OCNs outside OCLC itself. The control numbers link WorldCat's records to local library system records by providing a common reference key for a record across libraries.\nOCNs are particularly useful as identifiers for books and other bibliographic materials that do not have ISBNs (e.g., books published before 1970). OCNs are often used as identifiers for Wikipedia and Wikidata. In October 2013, it was reported that out of 29,673 instances of book infoboxes in Wikipedia, \"there were 23,304 ISBNs and 15,226 OCNs\", and regarding Wikidata: \"of around 14 million Wikidata items, 28,741 were books. 5403 Wikidata items have an ISBN associated with them, and 12,262 have OCNs.\"\nOCLC also runs the Virtual International Authority File (VIAF), an international name authority file, with oversight from the VIAF Council composed of representatives of institutions that contribute data to VIAF. VIAF numbers are broadly used as standard identifiers, including in Wikipedia.\n\nCompany acquisitions\nOCLC acquired NetLibrary, a provider of electronic books and textbooks, in 2002 and sold it in 2010 to EBSCO Industries. OCLC owns 100% of the shares of OCLC PICA, a library automation systems and services company which has its headquarters in Leiden in the Netherlands and which was renamed \"OCLC\" at the end of 2007. In July 2006, the Research Libraries Group (RLG) merged with OCLC.\nOn January 11, 2008, OCLC announced that it had purchased EZproxy. It has also acquired OAIster. The process started in January 2009 and from October 31, 2009, OAIster records are freely available via WorldCat.org.\nIn 2013, OCLC acquired the Dutch library automation company HKA and its integrated library system Wise, which OCLC calls a \"community engagement system\" that \"combines the power of customer relationship management, marketing, and analytics with ILS functions\". OCLC began offering Wise to libraries in the United States in 2019.\nIn January 2015, OCLC acquired Sustainable Collection Services (SCS). SCS offered consulting services based on analyzing library print collection data to help libraries manage and share materials. In 2017, OCLC acquired Relais International, a library interlibrary loan service provider based in Ottawa, Canada.\nA more complete list of mergers and acquisitions is available on the OCLC website.\n\nCriticism\nIn May 2008, OCLC was criticized by Jeffrey Beall for monopolistic practices, among other faults. Library blogger Rick Mason responded that although he thought Beall had some \"valid criticisms\" of OCLC, he demurred from some of Beall's statements and warned readers to \"beware the hyperbole and the personal nature of his criticism, for they strongly overshadow that which is worth stating\".\nIn November 2008, the Board of Directors of OCLC unilaterally issued a new Policy for Use and Transfer of WorldCat Records that would have required member libraries to include an OCLC policy note on their bibliographic records; the policy caused an uproar among librarian bloggers. Among those who protested the policy was the non-librarian activist Aaron Swartz, who believed the policy would threaten projects such as the Open Library, Zotero, and Wikipedia, and who started a petition to \"Stop the OCLC powergrab\". Swartz's petition garnered 858 signatures, but the details of his proposed actions went largely unheeded. Within a few months, the library community had forced OCLC to retract its policy and to create a Review Board to consult with member libraries more transparently. In August 2012, OCLC recommended that member libraries adopt the Open Data Commons Attribution (ODC-BY) license when sharing library catalog data, although some member libraries have explicit agreements with OCLC that they can publish catalog data using the CC0 Public Domain Dedication.\n\nSee also\nDynix (software)\nPublic library advocacy\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website \nHanging Together \u2013 the OCLC Research blog\nOCLC Annual Reports collection at the OCLC Archives","166":"Ocean Avenue is a road in Santa Monica, California.\n\nOverview\nOcean Avenue starts at the residential Adelaide Drive on the north end of Santa Monica and ends at Pico Boulevard.

The street is located off of the Plaza de Los \u00c1ngeles, the oldest plaza in California, which served as the center of the city life through the Spanish and Mexican eras into the early American era, following the Conquest of California. \nRestaurants, vendors, and public establishments line the street. Calle Olvera attracts almost two million visitors per year. The street is home to numerous of the oldest buildings in Los Angeles, include the \u00c1vila Adobe, the oldest standing residence in Los Angeles.\n\nGeography\nOlvera Street is in the northeast of modern-day Downtown Los Angeles, between Main and Alameda streets, running north from the Los Angeles Plaza to Cesar Chavez Avenue. It is part of El Pueblo de Los \u00c1ngeles Historical Monument, the area immediately around the Plaza. This is west of Union Station and southeast of Chinatown. Though Los Angeles was founded in 1781, this Plaza dates to the 1820s, and is approximately a block east and south of the original 18th-century Plaza.\n\nHistory\nThe street has variously been known as Placita Olvera, Calle de los Vignes, Vine Street, and Wine Street.\n\nEarly days\nLos Angeles was founded in 1781 by Spanish pobladores (settlers), on a site southeast of today's Olvera Street near the Los Angeles River. They consisted of 11 families\u201444 men, women, and children \u2014 and were accompanied by a few Spanish soldiers. They had come from nearby Mission San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel to establish a secular pueblo on the banks of the Porci\u00fancula River at the Indian village of Yaanga. Of the 44 original pobladores [colonists] who founded Los Angeles, only two were white, [\u2026] Of the other 42, 26 had some degree of African ancestry and 16 were Indians or mestizos [people of mixed Spanish and Indian blood]. \u2014 William M. Mason, 1975 The new town was named El Pueblo de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Reina de los \u00c1ngeles. Priests from San Gabriel established an asistencia (a sub-mission), the Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Reina de los Angeles Asistencia, to tend to their religious needs. The pueblo eventually built its own parish church, known today as the \"Old Plaza Church.\" The original 18th-century plaza was approximately a block north and west of the present one. Unpredictable flooding forced the settlers to abandon the original site and move to higher ground in the early 1800s, with the current Plaza at the center of the newly moved pueblo.\n\nSpanish colonial rule lasted until Mexican independence in 1821. This period saw Los Angeles's first streets and adobe buildings. During Mexican rule, which lasted twenty-six years, the Plaza was the heart of a vibrant ethnic Californio community life in Los Angeles and was the center of an economy based upon farming in the former flood plain, supplemented with cattle ranching.\nThe Pelanconi House was, in the second half of the 19th century, a winery producing wine from the grapes that grew there, and to this day still do. The DNA matches that of grapes at Mission San Gabriel, established in 1771.\nAfter the Mexican War, the Plaza remained the center of town. A small alley branching off of the Plaza, Wine Street, had its name changed by City Council ordinance in 1877 to Olvera Street to honor Agustin Olvera, the first Superior Court Judge of Los Angeles County, who owned a no-longer-existing adobe house nearby. In the 1880s, the little town grew rapidly due to the influx of settlers from Southern States. These joined the Spaniards and earlier English-speaking settlers who had become voting citizens before 1846.\nAs the town expanded, the original area of settlement came to be neglected, and served as a neighborhood for new immigrants, especially Mexicans and Sicilians. It included a Chinese community, which eventually relocated to the present nearby Chinatown to make way for the construction of Union Station. During the 1920s, the pace of Mexican immigration increased rapidly. California was the primary destination, with Los Angeles being a common choice. As a part of a movement to preserve what was viewed as California's \"authentic\" heritage, Christine Sterling began a public campaign to renovate the Francisco Avila Adobe, which evolved into a campaign to remake Olvera street as a modern Mexican-style market place.\n\nPreservation and restoration\nSterling's efforts to rescue the area began in 1926, when she learned of a plan to demolish the Avila Adobe, the oldest existing home in the city. After raising the issue with the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, Sterling approached Harry Chandler, the publisher of the Los Angeles Times, with a plan to create a Mexican marketplace and cultural center in the Plaza. Chandler was intrigued by the idea of packaging the Plaza area that acknowledged the Mexican heritage of the city while presenting a romanticized ersatz version, an ethnic theme park. He helped by providing extensive publicity and supporting the development plan in The Times.\nBy 1928, due to a lack of financial support for implementing her ideas, the project appeared to be doomed. In late November, Sterling found a Los Angeles City Health Department Notice of Condemnation posted in front of the Avila Adobe. In response, she posted her own hand-painted sign condemning the shortsightedness of city bureaucrats in failing to preserve an important historic site. Her act helped attract additional public interest in preserving the old adobe. The Los Angeles City Council finally reversed its original order of condemnation. Support for restoring the adobe rushed in from throughout the city. Building materials came from several local companies, including Blue Diamond Cement and the Simmons Brick Company, one of the largest employers of Mexicans in the Los Angeles area. Los Angeles Police Chief James Davis provided a crew of prison inmates to do hard labor on the project. Sterling oversaw the construction project, and an excerpt from her diary vividly captures her spirit and sense of desperation for financial support during the construction: \"One of the prisoners is a good carpenter, another an electrician. Each night I pray they will arrest a bricklayer and a plumber.\"\n\nIn spite of ample supplies and forced volunteers, the project lacked solid financial backing until Chandler came forward with capital for the project through funds collected at $1,000-a-plate luncheons with selected businessmen. Chandler established and headed the Plaza de Los Angeles Corporation, a for-profit venture which became the financial basis for the restoration of Plaza-Olvera. The street was closed to automotive traffic in 1929.\nOn Easter Sunday 1930, Sterling's romantic revival came to pass with the opening of Paseo de Los Angeles (which later became popularly known by its official street name Olvera Street). Touted as \"A Mexican Street of Yesterday in a City of Today\", Olvera Street was an instant success as a tourist site. La Opini\u00f3n, a leading Spanish-language daily, praised the project as \"una calleja que recuerda al M\u00e9xico viejo\" (a street which recalls old Mexico).\n\nEvents\nBlessing of the Animals event\nThe Blessing of the Animals at Olvera Street, an event dating to 1930, is held every S\u00e1bado de Gloria (Holy Saturday, the Saturday before Easter). The event was originally held in conjunction with the Feast Day of Saint Anthony of the Desert, but it was changed to take advantage of better weather. The original procession has grown into an all-day event with vendors, performers, and a procession where participants bring their animals to be blessed by religious authorities and others.\nThe event is held near the Biscailuz Building and is represented by a mural on its exterior, The Blessing of the Animals, by Leo Politi.  The event is also the subject of a book by the same name.\n\nLandmarks\nAvila Adobe\nThe Avila Adobe at 10 Olvera Street was built in 1818 and is the oldest surviving residence in Los Angeles. It was built by Francisco \u00c1vila, a wealthy cattle rancher.  Its adobe walls are 2\u00bd to 3 feet (0.91 m) thick.  U. S. Navy Commodore Robert Stockton took it over as his temporary headquarters when the United States first occupied the city in 1846. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the adobe is also designated as California State Landmark No. 145. It was restored starting 1926 through efforts by Christine Sterling, and now stands as a museum.\n\nSepulveda House\nThe Sepulveda House at 12 Olvera Street is a historic residence built in 1887 by Se\u00f1ora Eloisa Martinez de Sepulveda in the Eastlake architectural style.  The original structure included two commercial businesses and three residences. It has since then become a preserved museum, and is cited by its website as a representation of the \"blending of Mexican and Anglo culture\".\nEloisa Mart\u00ednez de Sep\u00falveda was born in the state of Sonora in Mexico. She lived there until 1844 when her parents, Francisca Gallardo and Estaquio Martinez, moved to Alta California at the urging of Francisca\u2019s brother, bringing the 11-year-old Eloisa and her older brother Luis, with them to Los Angeles.  In 1847, Se\u00f1ora Francisca Gallardo received from the ayuntamiento (Common Council) a plot of land between Bath and Wine street (renamed Olvera Street in 1877) on which she constructed an adobe residence. Se\u00f1ora Gallardo\u2019s adobe home at number 12 Bath Street was later enlarged to include by 1870 a second story and hipped roof. When Eloisa married Joaquin Sepulveda at the age of 23, she brought with her a dowry of land and cattle. Joaquin was an undistinguished member of an illustrious Southern California family. The marriage suffered from misfortune as the couple\u2019s only child died in infancy and Joaquin himself died in 1880 leaving no property. Se\u00f1ora Gallardo gave her property to her widowed daughter, Eloisa Martinez de Sepulveda, in 1881. On lands owned by her mother, Eloisa was able to finance the construction of a commercial building which provided her with a steady income. This was the Sepulveda Block, built in 1887.\nSe\u00f1ora Eloisa Martinez de Sepulveda built the two-story Sepulveda Block in 1887 in response to the city\u2019s real estate and population boom of the 1800s. The twenty-two room building cost $8,000 to erect. As her husband, Joaquin Sepulveda, had died seven years earlier leaving no estate, Se\u00f1ora Sepulveda probably financed the construction of the building on her own. By 1888 Bath Street had been renamed Main Street and the city had realigned and widened it, cutting off 18 feet (5.5 m) from the front of the adobe. Se\u00f1ora Sepulveda received $1,190 in compensation.\nWhen the Sepulveda Block was built in 1887 Se\u00f1ora Eloisa Sepulveda kept a suite of three rooms for her own use. Her bedroom reveals much about her Mexican heritage and the popular tastes and styles of the time. It would also reflect some of the places in Los Angeles in the decades following her arrival from Sonora in 1844. The d\u00e9cor of the room shows a practical acceptance of modern technology and contemporary fashion, with its mass-produced walnut furniture and gaslight chandelier. The bedroom has three different wallpapers and a typical flowered carpet. The somewhat-cluttered appearance is characteristic of the period and a sign of modest prosperity. By contrast, the brass bed with its draperies and fancy spread, the Chinese shawl, and the well-tended shrine are representative of Se\u00f1ora Sepulveda\u2019s Mexican upbringing and her strong religious beliefs. The large crucifix is on loan from Se\u00f1ora Sepulveda\u2019s descendants while the bed belonged to the Avila family, who were related to her by marriage. The pastel portrait is of her favorite niece, Eloisa Martinez de Gibbs.\nSe\u00f1ora Sepulveda chose American architects George F. Costerisan and William O. Merithew to design her two-story business block for residential and commercial rental in 1887. Although this particular type of building is probably unique in Los Angeles today, it was a \u201cpattern book\u201d building of a style that was common all over the country at the time. An exception in this building is the typically Mexican breezeway which separates the Main Street stores from the dwelling rooms in the rear. Thus, the Sepulveda Block represents the transition in Los Angeles from Mexican to a combination of Anglo and Mexican styles. The work \u201cblock\u201d is the Victorian term for a large commercial building. By this time the city had changed from a Mexican pueblo with a cattle-based economy to an American town with an agricultural economy. The population had grown from less than 2,000, most of whom were Mexican, to over 50,000, only 19% of whom were Mexican. When the building was constructed it appears that Se\u00f1ora Sepulveda herself occupied the three residential rooms located in the rear, facing Olvera Street, then an unpaved alley. Later, she may have occupied other quarters. Commercial tenants were located in the stores fronting on Main Street while the second floor was used as a boarding house.\nSe\u00f1ora Sepulveda bequeathed the building on her death in 1903 to her favorite niece and goddaughter, Eloisa Martinez de Gibbs. Edward Gibbs, an engineer and lumber company owner, had been a tenant in the Sepulveda Block. In 1888, the same year that he and Eloisa were married, Edward was elected to the City Council. Four of their five children were born in the second floor facing Main Street on the south side. In 1905, along with many other residents of the area, the Gibbs moved to a more fashionable neighborhood in Los Angeles. Succeeding generations of the Gibbs family operated the Gibbs Electrical Company and retained ownership of the Sepulveda Block until it was acquired by the State of California for $135,000 in 1958 as part of the Pueblo de Los Angeles State Historic Monument.\nBetween 1982 and 1984 major restoration took place in the Sepulveda Block. The building was structurally stabilized and plumbing, heating, air conditioning and electrical systems were installed. A new roof replaced the old one and the front staircase, which had been removed in the 1930s, was put back. The iron cresting is restored as are the red tin tiles over the bay windows. The west fa\u00e7ade is \u201cpenciled\u201d in the style of the period, meaning that the bricks are painted and mortar lines are traced in white on top. The east fa\u00e7ade on Olvera Street, although not originally painted, had previously been sandblasted, a process which destroys the outer surface of the brick, making it porous. As paint provides bricks with protective coating, they have been painted with the color which was first used in 1919. A 1983 archeological excavation beneath the wooden floor unearthed artifacts relating to the building\u2019s history. Peter Snell, partner with Long Hoeft Architects and Gus Duffy Architect, were the firms responsible for the Sepulveda Block restoration plans and construction supervision.\nDuring World War II the Sepulveda Block became a canteen for servicemen and three Olvera Street merchants were located in the building. The building continued to be used by Olvera Street merchants until 1981 when they were relocated for the building\u2019s restoration. Today, El Pueblo Park\u2019s Visitor\u2019s Center is located in the south store on the ground floor. This room represents the Victorian Eastlake style of 1890. Restoration plans call for the creation of an 1890s grocery store on the north side of the first floor.\n\nMural Am\u00e9rica Tropical\nThe mural Am\u00e9rica Tropical (full name: Am\u00e9rica Tropical: Oprimida y Destrozada por los Imperialismos, or Tropical America: Oppressed and Destroyed by Imperialism,) by David Siqueiros, was unveiled above the street in 1932. It was soon covered up to mask its political content. The Getty Conservation Institute has performed detailed conservation work on the mural to restore it and the America Tropical Interpretive Center opened to provide public access.\n\nPlaza Substation\nThe Plaza Substation, also at 10 Olvera Street, was part of the electric streetcar system operated by the Los Angeles Railway.  Completed in 1904, the substation provided electricity to power the yellow streetcars.  When the streetcar system closed in the 1940s, the building was converted to other uses.  The substation is one of the two buildings in the district that is separately listed in the National Register of Historic Places (the Avila Adobe is the other).\n\nPelanconi House\nPelanconi House at 17 Olvera Street, built in the 1850s, is the oldest surviving brick house in Los Angeles. In 1924, it was converted into a restaurant called La Golondrina, which was the oldest restaurant on Olvera Street until its closure in March 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Pelanconi House was a winery producing wine from the grapes that grew in the area, possibly even inside the Avila Adobe where they grow currently. The DNA matches that of grapes at Mission San Gabriel, established in 1771.\n\nPlaza Methodist Church\nBuilt in 1926, the Plaza Methodist Church was built on the site of the adobe once owned by Agust\u00edn Olvera, the man for whom Olvera Street was named. It is at the southeast corner of Olvera Street and Paseo de la Plaza (i.e. the Plaza).\n\nEugene Biscailuz Building\nThe former United Methodist Church headquarters, also built in 1926, was renamed in 1965 for Sheriff Eugene W. Biscailuz, who had helped Christine Sterling to preserve and transform Olvera Street. It housed the Mexican Consulate until 1991 and then the Mexican Cultural Institute.\n\nReception\nThe American Planning Association named Olvera Street one of the top five \"Great Streets\" in the United States for 2015.\nSome find Olvera Street to be a sanitized fabrication of Latin American culture merely to attract tourists, a \"fake\" Mexican presence; since 1926, it has garnered controversy as historians and collectors have attempted to preserve the sites for historic study and educational purposes. In contrast, there are researchers that often cite that Olvera Street is an \"appropriated\" misnomer of Latin-American and Hispanic culture, and should therefore not remain as a source of tourism. Even critics though, have acknowledged how the city fathers were ready to condemn and destroy the area in the 1920s. The attention brought to the area shamed the city into saving its heritage and preserving some of the original adobe buildings. This tension around an idealized cultural image is evident in the mural Am\u00e9rica Tropical (full name: Am\u00e9rica Tropical: Oprimida y Destrozada por los Imperialismos, or Tropical America: Oppressed and Destroyed by Imperialism) by David Siqueiros which was slated to be an exciting addition to the street until it was actually unveiled in 1932. The Getty Conservation Institute began performing detailed conservation work on the mural in 2010 and the America Tropical Interpretive Center opened to provide public access in 2012.\n\nIn popular culture\nWilliam M. Pizor produced a narrated  travelogue short film about the street in 1937 titled A Street of Memory. It is extant.\n\"Golondrina\", an opera by Lindsey C. Harnsberger was composed in 2015 to a libretto by Robert Cartland. The opera, originally titled \"Olvera Street,\" was premiered by Vineyard Touring Opera Company (VTO) in November 2017 in Los Angeles, Santa Monica, and South Pasadena, California. It was revised and retitled in 2017 for April and May performances by VTO in Glendale and South Pasadena, California. The story of the opera is based on Christine Sterling's fight to save the Avila Adobe and later restore Olvera Street.\nThe plaza, before it was improved, can be seen in Charlie Chaplin's 1921 film The Kid, which featured a number of scenes of the west side of the plaza a few doors north of the Pelanconi House.\nThe 4th book in the Robin Kane series by Eileen Hill has the mystery take place almost entirely on Olvera Street.\n\nSee also\nLA Plaza de Cultura y Artes\nRancho Camulos\nRancho San Francisco\nHistory of Los Angeles\nList of Registered Historic Places in Los Angeles\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOlvera Street Merchants Olvera Street\nEl Pueblo de Los Angeles Historical Monument.

It stretches from Ocean Avenue on the western end of Santa Monica to East Los Angeles\u2014farther than Wilshire Boulevard and most other streets.\nIts path runs parallel to and north of Pico Boulevard from Santa Monica to Downtown Los Angeles, and parallel to and south of Santa Monica Boulevard on its western end and Wilshire Boulevard past Beverly Hills.\nLike other major Los Angeles streets, Olympic is at least four lanes in width. Unlike other east-west arterial roads such as Wilshire Boulevard, Santa Monica Boulevard, and Sunset Boulevard, it does not cross   major attractions and sites and therefore contains far less traffic. While Wilshire crosses through the heart of Los Angeles, Olympic runs through the southern end of principal areas such as West Los Angeles, Westwood, Century City, Beverly Hills, Hancock Park, Koreatown, Westlake and Downtown Los Angeles. Little Ethiopia is east of Fairfax Avenue and Olympic. Proceeding east on Olympic, it breaks off in Downtown LA's Fashion District but continues on from there, passing the southern areas of Boyle Heights, East Los Angeles, Commerce, and Montebello with an eastern terminus in Pico Rivera as a small neighborhood street.\nOlympic Boulevard is primarily a commercial, urban street. There is a grass divider with trees in the Santa Monica portion. Around Carthay, Olympic passes through residential neighborhoods. A number of schools are located on Olympic as well. Crossroads School is located at Olympic and 20th in Santa Monica, New Roads Middle School is located at the Franklin\/Berkeley St. area in Santa Monica. and Wildwood School is located in between Bundy and Barrington. Los Angeles High School is located slightly to the east of Olympic and Highland Avenue.\nOlympic expands to six lanes starting east of Santa Monica and generally maintains a speed limit of 45 miles per hour (72 km\/h). Even so, due to Los Angeles traffic, Olympic often becomes congested.\nIt was originally named 10th Street, but was renamed Olympic Boulevard for the 1932 Summer Olympics, as that was the occasion of the tenth modern event.  Tenth Street School, at Olympic and Grattan, was founded in 1888 and has kept the original name. Parts of the old 10th Street exist as smaller streets near Hancock Park, in Westlake, and in the Central City East area southeast of Downtown.\n\nTransportation\nBus service throughout Olympic Boulevard is served between Santa Monica and Century City by Santa Monica Transit line 5, between Century City and Downtown LA by Metro Local line 28, and from The Fashion District east by Metro Local lines 62 and 66.\nThere are two rail stations on the Metro E Line that stop on or near Olympic Boulevard: one on 26th Street in Santa Monica outside the Bergamot Station and another slightly south of Olympic Boulevard at Bundy Drive.\n\nNotable landmarks\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Los Angeles Branch\nThe Grammy Museum\nLA Live\nLoyola Law School\nSammy Lee Square, at the corner of Normandie Avenue\nLos Angeles High School\nNational Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences headquarters\n\nSee also\nByron B.

Each New Year's Day, the Rose Parade participants and floats line up before dawn on Orange Grove Boulevard, facing north, for the  beginning of the parade. South Orange Grove has been the address of the affluent, both the famous and the infamous, since the early 1900s. The Los Angeles Times said: \"When a stranger comes to Pasadena now, the real-estate agent shows him Orange Grove Avenue.\n\nBackground\nOrange Grove Boulevard is one street of several exclusive residential districts in Pasadena. Since the early 20th century, because of the number of landmark mansions, the street earned the name Millionaire's Row, an appropriate nickname, considering that the estates that once lined this spacious boulevard and the surrounding neighborhood read like a Who's Who of American consumer products. The maker of Wrigley's chewing gum, William Wrigley Jr.'s,  significant home was proffered to the city of Pasadena after Mrs. Wrigley's death in 1958, under the condition that their home would be the Rose Parade's permanent headquarters. The stately Tournament House stands on Orange Grove Blvd. today, and serves as the headquarters for the Tournament of Roses Parade. In wartime 1942,\nOrange Grove Boulevard was used as an alternate route for the Rose Parade to avoid an enemy attack.\n\nNorth Orange Grove Boulevard\n\nFormerly referred to as Mountain Avenue, North Orange Grove Boulevard is home to the exquisite Gamble House. North of Holly Street, the road bends northeast, ending at North Fair Oaks Avenue.  The home of David Gamble, son of consumer product maker James Gamble of Procter & Gamble, is located on the north end of Orange Grove Blvd. The Gamble House, an American Craftsman masterpiece, was built in 1908, by architects Charles and Henry Greene, as an exemplification of their Ultimate bungalow. It is open to the public as both an architectural conservancy and museum. The Gamble House is a California Historical Landmark and a National Historic Landmark on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1966 it was deeded to the city of Pasadena in a mutual agreement with the University of Southern California School of Architecture. Ever since that time, two USC architecture students per year have been selected to live in the house full-time.\n\nEast Orange Grove Boulevard\nFormerly referred to as Illinois Street, this section of Orange Grove Boulevard runs through the more economically diverse northern part of the city. Although there is a small commercial district between Lincoln and Los Robles avenues, this section of the street is overwhelmingly residential. The street ends at California State Route 19 (North Rosemead Boulevard) and Sierra Madre Villa Avenue in Hastings Ranch. Orange Grove crosses Sierra Madre Boulevard just before ending.\n\nSouth Orange Grove Boulevard\nThe Norton Simon Museum is at the intersection of Orange Grove and Colorado boulevards. The museum can be quite clearly seen every year during the Rose Parade broadcast. The parade's official start is at Orange Grove Boulevard and Ellis Street.\nSouth Orange Grove Boulevard becomes South Orange Grove Avenue at Columbia Street and its southern terminus is a cul-de-sac in western South Pasadena, passing by Orange Grove Park. Between Columbia Street and Colorado Boulevard, the road is the center of an exclusive neighborhood. In 1876, unimproved land with water could be purchased for about $100 an acre. Currently, a small empty lot is likely to go for as much as $200,000. Most of the mansions in this area are gone; multiple residential courts and condominiums line the street. Valley Hunt Club, Maranatha High School, and Westridge School are located on South Orange Grove Boulevard.\n\nMobilizing Mobility\nThe city of South Pasadena has embarked on an ambitious project to improve both the safety and the ambience of South Orange Grove. The sidewalks along the street have been landscaped and refurbished. The addition of vintage street lights both improves the safety of pedestrians and contributes to the desired ambience.\n\nSee also\nList of streets in the San Gabriel Valley\n\n\n== References ==","170":"Pacific Boulevard is a street and principal commercial thoroughfare in the city of Huntington Park, California and the Los Angeles County neighborhood of Walnut Park. It runs from Vernon and Santa Fe Avenues in Vernon to Cudahy Street in Walnut Park before changing to Long Beach Boulevard. The Pacific Boulevard commercial district is the third highest grossing commercial district in the County of Los Angeles.  The Christmas Lane Parade, seen in millions of homes via television throughout the United States and parts of Europe, has run down Pacific Boulevard since 1946.  As many as 300,000 people attend the annual Carnaval Primavera (Spring Carnival) held on Pacific Boulevard each year.  Pacific Boulevard is well known to Latino residents of the L.A. area, and a magnet for commerce, culture, and night life.\nPacific Boulevard represents a \"Hispanic Mecca\" for shopping, culture, and people watching.  The area offers a variety of shopping options and features several national and regional tenants such as Bank of America, Chase Bank, AT&T, T-Mobile, Daniel's Jewelers, JCPenney, Foot Locker, El Gallo Giro, Don Roberto Jewelers, 3 Hermanos and Tierra Mia Coffee.  Pacific Boulevard also has numerous independent clothing and specialty stores that offer products for special occasions such as baptisms, first communions, quincea\u00f1eras, formal events and weddings.  (Id.) Several bars and restaurants feature live music and entertainment in the evenings.\nPacific Boulevard is a common location for remote broadcasts from local Spanish-language media stations. Television stations often profile successful businesses and popular festivals that attract hundreds of thousands of people, bringing national attention to the area.(Id.)  The Pacific Blvd. commercial area is arguably the most important area to the city because of the tax revenue it generates and the significant amount of employment available for residents. It is the center of the city\u2019s business improvement district (B.I.D.), an organization established in 1995 to focus on community and business revitalization efforts vis-\u00e0-vis the commercial business sector.(Id.)\n\nHistory\nThe Los Angeles Railway (local streetcars known as \"Yellow Cars\") J car ran along Pacific Boulevard and connected the area with Downtown Los Angeles until 1963. The stretch of Pacific Boulevard in downtown Huntington Park was a major commercial district serving the city's largely working-class residents, as well as those of neighboring cities such as Bell, Cudahy, and South Gate.  A New York Times article from 2000 about Pacific Boulevard described it as once being, \"the apotheosis of the postwar California dream, an all-white working-class Beverly Hills with swank department stores, auto dealerships and first-run cinemas.\" Major department stores included Montgomery Ward, J. C. Penney and local anchor Wineman's, as well as branches of Downtown Los Angeles-based chains such as Bond Stores. However, the thoroughfare was located three miles (5 km) from any freeway, which hampered growth. By 1968 more than sixty of its storefronts were vacant. \nIn the decades prior to the 1980s, the strip appeared to be derelict with vacancy rates up to 50 percent in its commercial spaces. By 1983, a wave of Latino immigrants during this time lead to dramatic improvements, making it again financially successful and heavily trafficked.\n\nAttractions\nThe Warner Huntington Park is an Art Deco motion picture palace that was opened in 1930. The architect was B. Marcus Priteca, the architect who created the Pantages Theater in Hollywood. The Warner Huntington Park is the sister theater to the Warner Beverly Hills and the Warner Grand in San Pedro. The Warner Huntington Park Theatre originally seated 1,468 people.  Huntington Park also boasted of the third Pussycat Theater to open in California.  It was called The Lyric and was located at 7208 Pacific Boulevard.\nEl Gallo Giro (Lat. Am.

By the year 2000, it had become the 7th most profitable restaurant in L.A. county ranked by annual gross sales, with receipts of $6.7M that year.   Despite its casual dining and working class clientele, its sales were such that it out-earned competitors such as the Parkway Grill in Pasadena, the Pacific Dining Car in Hollywood, the Paradise Cove in Malibu, and the Bel Air Hotel.

The high school serves the neighborhoods of Pacific Palisades, Palisades Highlands, Kenter Canyon, and portions of Brentwood (including Brentwood Circle). Residents in Topanga, an unincorporated section of Los Angeles County, may attend Palisades or William Howard Taft Charter High School.\nThe school serves grades 9 through 12. Formerly directly administered by the Los Angeles Unified School District, the school is now an independent charter school. Its current enrollment numbers 2,903 students.  Many students travel long distances to attend Palisades Charter High, which is one of the most highly ranked public high schools in the Los Angeles area.\nIn 2005, Palisades was recognized as a California Distinguished School. In 2015, Palisades was named one of America's Best High Schools by Newsweek and U.S. News & World Report.\nPaul Revere Charter Middle School students are allowed to attend as a feeder school.\n\nHistory\nThe school was founded in 1961. It was built for $6 million on a filled-in canyon. At the time it was the most expensive high school in the LA City Schools. The founding principal was Herbert L. Aigner (died in 2000). The Class of 2012 was the 50th graduating class. \nPrior to the founding, the property was called All Hallows Farm and for many years was owned by the Conway family: Hollywood film director Jack Conway; his wife, actress Virginia Conway \u2014 daughter of silent screen star Francis X. Bushman \u2014 and their two sons, one of whom, Pat Conway became an actor as well. This property was subsequently rented to actress Debbie Reynolds and her husband, singer Eddie Fisher. It was then taken, some years later, by the State by eminent domain to build the high school.\nSeveral members of the class of 1965 were profiled in a Time magazine article, which led to a best-selling 1976 book by class members David Wallechinsky and Michael Medved, What Really Happened to the Class of '65? The book featured interviews with several members of the class, whose experiences were recounted both individually and in groupings around shared themes such as the Vietnam War and the draft, drug experimentation, and sex. Various teachers from the school also were interviewed, among them French teacher Mr. Fred Johnson, and English teachers Miss Jean O'Brien and Mrs. Rose \"Mama G\" Gilbert, who retired during 2012-2013 after 63 years of teaching. At age 94, Mrs. Gilbert was the oldest active teacher in the LAUSD. The Star Wars character of Maz Kanata was based on her. The success of the book later inspired a short-lived television dramatic anthology series of the same title, which ran from December 1977 to July 1978 on NBC.\nIn 1989 20\/20 aired an episode about the students of Palisades High School. Howard Rosenberg of the Los Angeles Times wrote that \"Palisades High School is characterized here as both an institution of high academic performance and high drug and alcohol use. What 20\/20 doesn't ask tonight is how both are possible at the same school.\"\nCirca 1992 there were so few students that LAUSD was considering closing the school. Pali High parents, principal Merle Price, and Pali High staff decided to advocate for making the school into a charter school. In 1993 the school, along with three feeder elementary schools, received approval from the Los Angeles Board of Education to become a charter school. This was the first time a group of schools in California became charter schools. The school asked students to abide by a behavior code and instituted new academic programs. By 1998 student enrollment recovered: it had 200 students previously attending private schools.\nThis school was the focus of a false email chain letter started around 2002. The message falsely claimed that a satiric message to parents about student truancies and homework problems was actually on the school's answering machine. The message was originally written in response to parent outrage that students who skipped class more than ten days per 90-schoolday semester (not counting legitimate absences, like sickness) could receive a failing grade in that class. This was reported on several websites, including Snopes, and BreakTheChain.org.\n\nCampus\nThe campus is bounded by Temescal Canyon Road to the east, Sunset Boulevard to the north, El Medio Street to the west, and Temescal Academy (formerly known as first Temescal Canyon Continuation School and later Temescal High School) to the south. It is bisected by Bowdoin Street, which runs between the school's football field and the academic center of the school. Located only a mile from Will Rogers State Beach, the football stadium is called \"Stadium by the Sea.\"\nOn April 25, 2021, the music video for Olivia Rodrigo's song \"Good 4 U\" was filmed at Palisades, directed by Petra Collins. The song later debuted at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100.\nAs of 2010, approximately 43% of the student body, 1,180 out of 2,742 students, were bused to Palisades Charter High School from more than 100 Los Angeles zip codes. In 1994, approximately 70% of the student body, 1,176 out of 1,680 students, were bused from South-Central and East Los Angeles.\n\nDemographics\nAccording to U.S. News & World Report, 49% of Palisades Charter's student body is \"of color,\" with 32% of the student body coming from an economically disadvantaged household, determined by student eligibility for California's reduced-price meal program.\n\nCurriculum\nAs of 1998, most of the school's classes were university preparatory in nature. It hosts a mathematics, science, and technology magnet program. The school also has humanities and marine biology courses.\nThe school includes a New Media Academy that was, as of 1998, one of three in LAUSD. Pali High uses its charter school status to increase the visibility of this program. By that year DreamWorks had financed it with $100,000. The location fees generated by Aaron Spelling's use of the school for Malibu Shores were used to, by 1998, install a new computer lab.\nAs of 2002, Palisades High School offered a surfing class that can be taken for physical education credit. It was established around 1998 by Ray Millette, a marine biology teacher and surfer.\nPalisades Charter High School is known for its music program. Its marching band has medaled three years in a row at the SCSBOA championships: in 2013 winning silver, in 2014 winning gold for 3A, and in 2015 winning bronze. The school also has a winter drumline that competes in both SCPA and WGI, and is also the 2016 SCPA \"A class\" silver medalist.\n\nDiscrimination and lawsuits\nIn 2016, extensive hate graffiti was found at the campus including references to the Ku Klux Klan, Jews, African-Americans, and LGBTQ people.\nIn June 2017, Palisades Charter High School gained national media attention after an African-American student was depicted in a student blog with a noose drawn around her neck.\nIn December 2021, following a false school shooting threat targeting Pali as well as other schools in the area, extensive graffiti was discovered on the campus. Among other things, messages proclaiming \"Black Lives Matter\" and \"Kill the Dean\" were spray-painted, along an anarchy symbol and symbols of other extremist political movements.\n\nNotable alumni\nJ.

The Palisades would later be sought after by celebrities and other high-profile individuals seeking privacy. It is known for its seclusion, being a close-knit community with a small-town feel, Mediterranean climate, hilly topography, natural environment, abundance of parkland and hiking trails, a 3-mile (4.8 km) strip of coastline, and for being home to several architecturally significant homes. As of 2021, the community's population was 23,156.\nPacific Palisades is a largely residential community and does not attract many tourists other than day visitors to Gladstones Malibu, the local beaches, the Getty Villa or the Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine.\nNicknamed \"the Palisades\" and \"Pali\" by surfers and locals, the Palisades coast spans from after Sorrento Beach in Santa Monica to the south, and ends at Sunset Point Beach and Malibu to the north. Beaches along the Pacific Palisades coast include: Will Rogers State Beach, Sunset Point Beach, and one of the few unofficially gay beaches in Los Angeles, Ginger Rogers Beach. The many parks within the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area lie along the ridges above the community, along with local parks that include Will Rogers State Historic Park.\nThe Palisades is bounded by Brentwood to the east, Malibu to the west, Santa Monica to the southeast, the Santa Monica Bay to the southwest, Topanga and the Santa Monica Mountains to the north.\n\nEtymology\nThe name \"Pacific Palisades\" comes from the term \"palisades,\" a geological formation consisting of a series of cliff-like bluffs situated by a body of water, in this case the Pacific Ocean, and also for the area's purported resemblance to The Palisades on the west side of the lower Hudson River.\n\nHistory\nNative American period\nArcheological evidence shows Native American Indians living in the Santa Monica Mountains and the surrounding area including Pacific Palisades for over 10,000 years. Prior to European contact, the western sections of the Santa Monica mountains were inhabited by the Tongva people. The closest Tongva settlement to Pacific Palisades with a written record is the village of Topa'nga. The village of Topa'nga sits on the western-most edge of Tongva territory, neighboring the territory of the Chumash people to the north. Due to this close proximity to the Chumash, the culture in western Tongva territory contained elements of Chumash influence.\n\nMexican period\nThe land that became Pacific Palisades was originally within the boundaries of Rancho Boca de Santa Monica, granted by the governor of California during the Mexican period to Francisco Marquez and Ysidro Reyes in 1839. The Ysidro Reyes Adobe was the first adobe home ever built in Santa Monica Canyon, erected in the year 1838 on land now known as Pampas Ricas Blvd in Pacific Palisades. Sketches of adobe dwelling exist in the collection of the UCLA Library. A memorial plaque sits in a boulder on Pampas Ricas Blvd commemorating the adobe house, dedicated in the 1950s. Ysidro Reyes died in 1863. Reyes left his portion of Rancho Boca de Santa Monica to his widow, Maria Antonia Villa, who sold it to developer and railroad magnate Robert Symington Baker in 1875.\n\n1911-1922\nIn 1911, film director Thomas Ince constructed his film studio, \"Inceville\", which was on a 460-acre (1.9 km2) tract of land he leased called Bison Ranch at Sunset Blvd. and Pacific Coast Highway in the Santa Monica Mountains. Today this is where the Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine is located. By the following year, Ince had earned enough money to purchase the ranch and was able to lease an additional 18,000 acres (73 km2) lot in what is now in the Palisades Highlands neighborhood. stretching 7.5 miles (12.1 km) up Santa Ynez Canyon. This was the first major development built in the Palisades since the Mexican rancho era.\n\nThis was the first studio in the area which featured silent stages, production offices, printing labs, a commissary large enough to serve lunch to hundreds of workers, dressing rooms, props houses, elaborate sets, all in one central location.\nWhen Inceville was completed, the streets were lined with many types of structures, from humble cottages to mansions, mimicking the style and architecture of different countries. Extensive outdoor western sets were built and used on the site for several years. According to Katherine La Hue in her book, Pacific Palisades: Where the Mountains Meet the Sea:\n\nInce invested $35,000 in building, stages and sets ... a bit of Switzerland, a Puritan settlement, a Japanese village ... beyond the breakers, an ancient brigantine weighed anchor, cutlassed men swarming over the sides of the ship, while on the shore performing cowboys galloped about, twirling their lassos in pursuit of errant cattle ... The main herds were kept in the hills, where Ince also raised feed and garden produce. Supplies of every sort were needed to house and feed a veritable army of actors, directors and subordinates.\nWhile the cowboys, Native Americans and assorted workers lived at \"Inceville,\" the main actors came from Los Angeles and other communities as needed, often taking the red trolley cars to the Long Wharf in what is now the Temescal Canyon neighborhood, where buckboards conveyed them to the set.\nInce lived in a house overlooking the vast studio in what is now the Marquez Knolls neighborhood. Indeed, \"Inceville\" became a prototype for Hollywood film studios of the future, with a studio head (Ince), producers, directors, production managers, production staff, and writers all working together under one organization and under the supervision of a General Manager, Fred J. Balshofer. On January 16, 1916, a fire broke out at Inceville, the first of many that eventually destroyed all of the buildings. Ince later gave up on the studio and sold it to William S. Hart, who renamed it \"Hartville.\" Three years later, Hart sold the lot to Robertson-Cole Pictures Corporation, which continued filming there until 1922. La Hue writes that \"the place was virtually a ghost town when the last remnants of \"Inceville\" were burned on July 4, 1922, leaving only a \"weatherworn old church, which stood sentinel over the charred ruins.\"\n\n1921\u20131931\nA decade later, the Rev. Charles H. Scott and the Southern California Methodist Episcopal Church bought the land; in 1922, Scott founded Pacific Palisades, envisioning an elaborate religious-intellectual commune. Believers snapped up choice lots and lived in tents during construction. By 1925, the Palisades had 100 homes. In one subdivision, streets were named in alphabetical order for Methodist missionaries (the \"Alphabet Streets\"). The tents eventually were replaced by cabins, then by bungalows, and ultimately by multimillion-dollar homes. The climate of the area was a big selling point. Temperatures are much cooler than inland Los Angeles during summer, but usually sunnier and less foggy than areas south along the coast (e.g. Santa Monica).\nPacific Palisades enjoyed steady growth throughout the Roaring 20s, but it was still a small, isolated community out on the edge of Los Angeles. It began to become less isolated with the paving of Sunset Boulevard\u00b1 in 1925, which brought an increased flow of traffic through the community and offered more convenient accessibility to nearby Westwood and Beverly Hills.\n1929 would prove to be a pivotal year in the history of the Palisades, and by that time the town consisted of only about 365 homes and about 1,000 residents who mostly resided in the so-called \"Alphabet Streets\" neighborhood, although residential construction was now expanding into what would later become the Castellammare, Huntington and Paseo Miramar neighborhoods. On August 18 of that year, the cornerstone was laid for the foundation of the Methodist Episcopal Church on Via de la Paz, which at that time was the community's only church. Directly across the street, planning was underway for the town's first permanent school building which would later become known as \"Palisades Elementary\", which was dedicated on June 12, 1931.\nIn 1928, the Los Angeles Police Department began renting temporary office space in the now-historic Business Block building for the price of $10 a month. The following year, a motorcycle officer was assigned to make nightly patrols in the area. The Palisades finally acquired its own fire station in 1929, located on Sunset, adjacent to where the local Chase Bank branch now stands in the Village neighborhood.\nBy the end of the decade, nearly all remaining open areas of Pacific Palisades were being developed, reflecting the areas booming growth and the Palisades' coastal allure. Golfers were enjoying the already acclaimed Riviera Country Club, opened in 1927. Later in the decade construction started on the Bel-Air Bay Club, opened in March 1930.\n\n1930\u2013present\nThe Palisades was a refuge for many German-Jewish and Austrian-Jewish intellectuals and artists fleeing from pre-war Germany and, later, from the Holocaust, many of whom associated with the Exilliteratur settled in Pacific Palisades, including Thomas Mann, Lion Feuchtwanger, Theodor W. Adorno, Vicki Baum, Herbert Zipper, and Emil Ludwig. Some of these Jewish refugees had previously sought refuge in the south of France (and had to flee due to the fall of France to the Vichy regime), and were surprised by the similarities with the Mediterranean climate and topography. Villa Aurora on Paseo Miramar, the Spanish colonial home of Feuchtwanger and his wife, Marta, became the focal point of the expatriate community, which was nicknamed \"Weimar by the Sea\". Some non-Jewish exiles who were married to people with Jewish ancestry chose to settle in the Palisades as well, such as Thomas Mann and his wife Katia Mann who resided at 1550 San Remo Drive in the Riviera neighborhood.\nFor many decades there was a virtual ban on the sale of alcoholic beverages in the district, and a Chinese restaurant, House of Lee, held the only liquor license. The Methodist Church created a Chautauqua Conference Grounds in Temescal Canyon. The Presbyterian Synod purchased the property in 1943 and used it as a private retreat center until the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy purchased the property in 1994 to become Temescal Gateway Park.\nThough the Palisades had a notable Jewish population since at least the 1930s, it was still largely Methodist until the 1970s. This is when the Palisades began to see an explosion of affluent Jewish migration, accompanied by the opening of a local landmark Mort's Deli, in 1972. The beloved landmark closed in 2007.\n\nGeography\nPacific Palisades is about 7 miles (11 kilometers) west of the UCLA campus. The Santa Monica Mountain range runs through the northern and eastern sections of Pacific Palisades, accessible through a series of trailheads.\nThe Pacific Palisades covers a total area of 24.31 square miles (63 km2), comprising 22.84 square miles (59.2 km2) of land and 1.47 square miles (3.8 km2) of water. The Palisades coast is about three miles (4.8 km) in length.\n\nClimate\nPacific Palisades has a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen Csb), and receives just enough annual precipitation to avoid semi-arid climate (BSh),. Daytime temperatures are generally temperate all year round. In winter, they average around 68 \u00b0F (20 \u00b0C) giving it a tropical feel although it is a few degrees too cool to be a true tropical climate on average due to cool night temperatures. Pacific Palisades has plenty of sunshine throughout the year, with an average of only 35 days with measurable precipitation annually.\nTemperatures in the Palisades exceed 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) on a dozen or so days in the year, from one day a month in April, May, June and November to three days a month in July, August, October and to five days in September. The average annual temperature of the sea is 63 \u00b0F (17 \u00b0C), from 58 \u00b0F (14 \u00b0C) in January to 68 \u00b0F (20 \u00b0C) in August. Hours of sunshine total more than 3,000 per year, from an average of 7 hours of sunshine per day in December to an average of 12 in July. Pacific Palisades, like much of the rest of the southern California coast, is subject to a late spring\/early summer weather phenomenon called \"June Gloom\". This involves overcast or foggy skies in the morning that yield to sun by early afternoon.\nPacific Palisades averages 14.93 in (379 mm) of precipitation annually, mainly occurring between November and March, generally in the form of moderate rain showers, but sometimes as heavy rainfall during winter storms. Rainfall is usually higher in the neighborhoods located in the hills and coastal slopes of the Santa Monica Mountains, such as the Highlands and Castellammare; due to orographic uplift. Summer days are typically rainless. Rarely, an incursion of moist air from the south or east can bring brief thunderstorms in late summer, especially to the mountains. The coast gets slightly less rainfall, while the inland and mountain areas get considerably more. Years of average rainfall are rare. The usual pattern is year to year variability, with a short string of dry years of 5\u201310 in (130\u2013250 mm) rainfall, followed by one or two wet years with more than 20 in (510 mm). Wet years are usually associated with warm water El Ni\u00f1o conditions in the Pacific, dry years with cooler water La Ni\u00f1a episodes. A series of rainy days can bring floods to the lowlands and mudslides to the hills, especially after wildfires have denuded the slopes.\nBoth freezing temperatures and snowfall are extremely rare in the hills and canyon ridges and along the coast, with the last occurrence of a 32 \u00b0F (0 \u00b0C) reading being on. While the most recent snowfall occurred in January 2021, it has also occurred several other times in recorded history, the second-most recent being in February 2019, with snow falling in some areas of the Palisades as recently as January 2021. At the official downtown station, the highest recorded temperature is 113 \u00b0F (45 \u00b0C) on September 27, 2010, while the lowest is 28 \u00b0F (\u22122 \u00b0C), on January 4, 1949. During autumn and winter, Santa Ana winds sometimes bring much warmer and drier conditions to Pacific Palisades, and raise wildfire risk.\n\nNeighborhoods\nThe Village\nThe Village is the Pacific Palisades' walkable, vibrant downtown area and small central business district with its center at Sunset Boulevard and Via de la Paz.

Moore designed his first house in Los Angeles for the UCLA economist and urban planning professor, Leland Burns. The house was completed in 1974. It occupies a narrow ledge on a steep slope of the Santa Monica canyon. The house is composed of an interlocking set of shed roofs and tower, its forms reminiscent of The Sea Ranch Condominium, but adapted for a sense of the Mediterranean climate and Hollywood allusions. An interior staircase climbs up through a vertical cleft in the narrow house, and then at the very top of the third story, the stair descends outside, back down into a swimming pool court. Designer Tina Beebe developed with Moore the color scheme, whereby exterior planes were painted in a range of ochres, pinks, roses, and golds, so as the light and shade shifts during the day, the house itself seems to change like a chameleon. The house was built around a tracker organ hand-built by J\u00fcrgen Ahrend, an instrument known as Opus 1, U.S.A.\n\nBradbury House\nThe Bradbury House is a historic house in the Huntington Palisades neighborhood.

At 656 miles (1,056 km), it is the longest state route in California, and the second-longest in the US after Montana Highway 200. SR 1 has several portions designated as either Pacific Coast Highway (PCH), Cabrillo Highway, Shoreline Highway, or Coast Highway. Its southern terminus is at Interstate 5 (I-5) near Dana Point in Orange County and its northern terminus is at U.S. Route 101 (US 101) near Leggett in Mendocino County. SR 1 also at times runs concurrently with US 101, most notably through a 54-mile  (87 km) stretch in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, and across the Golden Gate Bridge.\nThe highway is designated as an All-American Road. In addition to providing a scenic route to numerous attractions along the coast, the route also serves as a major thoroughfare in the Greater Los Angeles Area, the San Francisco Bay Area, and several other coastal urban areas.\nSR 1 was built piecemeal in various stages, with the first section opening in the Big Sur region in the 1930s. However, portions of the route had several names and numbers over the years as more segments opened. It was not until the 1964 state highway renumbering that the entire route was officially designated as SR 1. Although SR 1 is a popular route for its scenery, frequent landslides and erosion along the coast have caused several segments to be either closed for lengthy periods for repairs, or re-routed inland.\n\nRoute description\nSR 1 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and through the Los Angeles metro area, Monterey, Santa Cruz, and San Francisco metro area is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. The California State Legislature has also relinquished state control of segments within Dana Point, Newport Beach, Santa Monica, and Oxnard; those segments are now maintained by those respective municipalities.\nThe Big Sur section from San Luis Obispo to Carmel is an official National Scenic Byway. SR 1 is eligible to be included in the State Scenic Highway System; however, only a few stretches between Los Angeles and San Francisco have officially been designated as a scenic highway, meaning that there are substantial sections of highway passing through a \"memorable landscape\" with no \"visual intrusions\", where the potential designation has gained popular favor with the community.\nThe entire route is designated as a Blue Star Memorial Highway to recognize those in the United States armed forces; this designation is sponsored by the California Garden Clubs, but the organization has not erected such markers along SR 1 yet. In 1959, the legislature officially designated the segment in Southern California between Interstate 5 (I-5) in Dana Point and US 101 near Oxnard as the Pacific Coast Highway (commonly referred to as \"PCH\", without the definite article \"the\", unlike other freeway numbers in the Los Angeles area). Between US 101 at the Las Cruces junction (8 miles [13 km] south of Buellton) and US 101 in Pismo Beach, and between US 101 in San Luis Obispo and Interstate 280 in San Francisco, the legislature also designated SR 1 as the Cabrillo Highway in 1959, after the explorer Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo who sailed along the coast line. The legislature also designated the route as the Shoreline Highway in 1957 between the Manzanita Junction near Marin City and Leggett. Smaller segments of the highway have been assigned several other names by the state and municipal governments.\nFor the most part, SR 1 runs parallel to the coastline, or close to it, but does turn several miles inland at various locations to avoid several federally controlled or protected areas such as Vandenberg Space Force Base, Diablo Canyon Power Plant and Point Reyes National Seashore. In addition to connecting the coastal cities and communities along its path, the route provides access to beaches, parks, and other attractions along the coast, making it a popular route for tourists. The route annually helps bring several billion dollars to the state's tourism industry. Segments of SR 1 range from urban freeway to simple rural two-lane road. Under the California Coastal Act, those segments of the highway that run through the rural areas of the protected California Coastal Zone may not be widened beyond a scenic two-lane road.\n\nOrange County\nAt its southernmost end in Orange County, SR 1 terminates at I-5 in Capistrano Beach in Dana Point. It then travels west into the city center. After leaving Dana Point, Pacific Coast Highway (PCH) becomes simply \"Coast Highway\" while at the same time continuing northwest along the coast through Laguna Beach (where it meets the southern terminus of SR 133) and Crystal Cove State Park.\nSR 1 then enters Newport Beach and passes through several affluent neighborhoods, including Newport Coast and Corona Del Mar, spans the entrance to the Upper Newport Bay, which marks the boundary between East Coast Highway and West Coast Highway, and crosses California State Route 55 near its southern terminus. Upon crossing the Santa Ana River mouth and entering Huntington Beach, SR 1 regains the Pacific Coast Highway designation. It passes Huntington State Beach and the southern terminus of California State Route 39 before reaching Bolsa Chica State Beach and the Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve. PCH then continues along the coast into Seal Beach, the final city on its journey in Orange County.\n\nLos Angeles and Ventura counties\nPCH enters Los Angeles County and the city of Long Beach after crossing the San Gabriel River. SR 1 then continues northwest through the city to its junction with Lakewood Boulevard (State Route 19) and Los Coyotes Diagonal at the Los Alamitos Circle, more than 2 miles (3.2 km) from the coast. From the traffic circle, it continues inland west through Long Beach, including approximately one mile adjacent to the southern boundary of Signal Hill. PCH is marked as such in Long Beach, but originally bore the name of Hathaway Avenue east of the traffic circle and State Street west of there. PCH then passes through the Los Angeles districts of Wilmington and Harbor City. While bypassing the immediate coastline of Palos Verdes, SR 1 continues to head west into the cities of Lomita and Torrance along the route of the former Redondo-Wilmington Boulevard.\nPCH then turns north through Redondo Beach and Hermosa Beach. Upon entering Manhattan Beach, it becomes Sepulveda Boulevard and turns back into PCH designation through El Segundo. At Imperial Highway, it regains the name Sepulveda Boulevard as it descends and passes under two runways of Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) via the Sepulveda Boulevard Tunnel.\n\nAfter leaving LAX, SR 1 splits from Sepulveda and turns northwest, becoming Lincoln Boulevard and passing through the Los Angeles neighborhoods of Westchester, Playa Vista, and Venice, as well as the unincorporated community of Marina Del Rey. This portion of SR 1 suffers heavy congestion at most times due to the shortage of alternate north-south arterial roads west of Interstate 405.  It then enters the city of Santa Monica, where SR 1 turns southwest, merging onto the westernmost segment of the Santa Monica Freeway. Passing through the McClure Tunnel (which also serves as the national western terminus of Interstate 10), SR 1 emerges along the beachfront in Santa Monica as PCH again and continues along the coast, separated from Downtown Santa Monica by the palisades north of Santa Monica Pier; this portion is also known locally as Palisades Beach Road and formerly as Roosevelt Highway. Upon leaving Santa Monica, PCH continues to follow the coast, curving west through the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles before becoming the main thoroughfare of the city of Malibu while traversing the entire 21 miles (34 km) of that city.\n\nSR 1 crosses the county line and continues through the Ventura County portion of the Malibu coast through Leo Carrillo State Park and Point Mugu State Park. After passing through a notch in the promontory that marks Point Mugu, the western end of the Santa Monica Mountains, and the beginning of the Oxnard Plain. The road cut left a very large rock formation at the tip of the point that is called the Mugu Rock. At that point, PCH leaves the coast and heads north, and then northwest as a freeway along the northeastern boundary of Naval Base Ventura County Point Mugu for several miles to an interchange at Rice Avenue, Pleasant Valley Road, and Oxnard Boulevard in Oxnard. The reconstructed interchange at Rice Avenue and Pleasant Valley Road channels traffic north on the surface street, Rice Avenue, towards the interchange with US 101. The historic route along Oxnard Boulevard was relinquished in 2014. Truck traffic to and from the Port of Hueneme also uses this designated route at the Rice Avenue\/Hueneme Road connector to connect with Route 101 at the Rice Avenue Interchange.\nAfter traveling through Ventura, SR 1 separates from US 101 to travel the historic beach route along the Rincon coast that was originally opened up by the construction of the Railroad Coastal Route from Emma Wood State Beach to the Mobil Pier Undercrossing near Sea Cliff, where it rejoins US 101 about 3 miles (4.8 km) south of the Santa Barbara County line near La Conchita.\n\nCentral Coast\nThe US 101\/SR 1 concurrency (although actual signage mentioning SR 1 through this segment is nonexistent) from the Mobil Pier Undercrossing runs for 54 miles (87 km), passing through the City of Santa Barbara and its neighboring communities along the coast of Santa Barbara County. The route then turns away from the Gaviota Coast at Gaviota State Beach, avoiding Point Conception, and heads due north through Gaviota State Park and the Gaviota Tunnel. In Las Cruces, SR 1, now named Cabrillo Highway, splits again from US 101 and heads northwest to the city of Lompoc. It is briefly joined with SR 246 along Lompoc's east-west Ocean Avenue, before turning north as H Street to Harris Grade Road, where it then regains the Cabrillo Highway name.\nAfter reaching the main entrance to Vandenberg Space Force Base, SR 1 turns northeast, away from the immediate coastline of the base, to join SR 135. Route 135 then splits from Route 1 south of Orcutt, and the Cabrillo Highway turns northwest back towards the coast to Guadalupe. It enters San Luis Obispo County, avoiding the immediate coastline of the protected Guadalupe-Nipomo Dunes, before passing through Grover Beach and subsequently joining US 101 for the third time at Pismo Beach. The US 101\/SR 1 concurrency then avoids the immediate coastline of Avila Beach and Diablo Canyon Power Plant, and instead heads straight inland to San Luis Obispo.\nSR 1 splits from US 101 at Santa Rosa Street in San Luis Obispo and then resumes as a four lane road as the Cabrillo Highway. It rejoins the coast in Morro Bay, running through that city as a freeway, where it crosses Morro Creek at the site of a prehistoric Chumash settlement dating to the Millingstone Horizon. From there, SR 1 proceeds north to Cayucos until it again becomes a winding, two lane road with occasional passing lanes. It then continues along the coast through Cambria and San Simeon, and past the elephant seal colony at Piedras Blancas Light Station. SR 1 provides access to Hearst Castle in San Simeon in Northern San Luis Obispo County.\n\nBig Sur\nSR 1 then enters the Big Sur region, crossing San Carp\u00f3foro Creek just south of the Monterey County line. For about 72 miles (116 km) from San Carp\u00f3foro Creek to Malpaso Creek, the road winds and hugs the cliffs of Big Sur, passing various coastal parks in the area, with no connection to the other side of the Santa Lucia Mountains except for Nacimiento-Fergusson Road. The road briefly leaves the coast for a few miles, passing through a redwood forest in the Big Sur River valley. The Big Sur segment of the highway, built between 1919 and 1937, also crosses a number of historic bridges, including the scenic Bixby Bridge, a reinforced concrete arch with a 320-foot (98 m) span that passes over the Bixby Creek gorge, the Rocky Creek Bridge, and the Big Creek Bridge.\n\nMonterey Bay Area\nAfter crossing the Carmel River, SR 1 turns inland and runs along the eastern boundary of Carmel and the western boundary of Carmel Valley before becoming a freeway in Monterey. After bypassing the immediate coastline of Pebble Beach and the rest of the Monterey Peninsula, the freeway heads north along the coast of Monterey Bay through Sand City, Seaside, and Marina. At the interchange with SR 156 near Castroville, SR 1 continues north as a two-lane rural road to Moss Landing.\nSR 1 becomes a freeway once again just before entering into Santa Cruz County. This four-lane freeway continues up the Monterey Bay coast through Watsonville to its interchange with SR 17 in Santa Cruz. (This trumpet interchange is locally known as The Fishhook due to its tight loop ramps that resemble a fishhook when viewed from above). After a short expressway section, it skirts downtown Santa Cruz as four-lane Mission Street, regaining the Cabrillo Highway designation (local\/historic name is \"Coast Road\") after it leaves the city and continues north-west as a two-lane road (with occasional four-lane sections) up the coast through Davenport.\n\nSan Francisco Bay Area\nEntering San Mateo County, SR 1 follows the west coast of the San Francisco Peninsula, passing by the marine mammal colonies at A\u00f1o Nuevo State Park, and the historic Pigeon Point Lighthouse, before reaching Half Moon Bay. Between Half Moon Bay and Pacifica, the highway bypasses a treacherous stretch known as Devil's Slide via the Tom Lantos Tunnels.\n\nSR 1 then becomes a freeway once again at Sharp Park in Pacifica before turning inland to join Interstate 280 in Daly City. Just short of reaching the City and County of San Francisco, SR 1 splits from Interstate 280, where the road becomes Junipero Serra Boulevard. Shortly thereafter, the highway makes a slight left, becoming the six-lane wide 19th Avenue; the San Francisco Municipal Railway's M Ocean View streetcar line runs in the median from this point until a junction to a rail only right-of-way near Rossmoor Drive. SR 1 then turns into Park Presidio Boulevard after it passes through the city's Golden Gate Park. Then after entering the Presidio of San Francisco, it goes through the MacArthur Tunnel before joining US 101 for a fourth time on the approach to the Golden Gate Bridge known as Doyle Drive.\nAfter crossing the bridge and entering Marin County, SR 1 then splits from US 101 again near Marin City, where it leaves the city and, as the Shoreline Highway, returns to a winding, two lane road as it passes over the Marin Hills to rejoin the coast at Muir Beach. After passing Stinson Beach and the Bolinas Lagoon, SR 1 avoids the immediate coastline of Point Reyes National Seashore and the rest of the Point Reyes Peninsula, and instead heads towards, and then along, the eastern shore of Tomales Bay.\nLeaving Tomales Bay, SR 1 heads further inland to intersect with Valley Ford Road just north of the Sonoma County border. It then rejoins the coast in Bodega Bay, where its name changes to Coast Highway past the Sonoma Coast State Beaches. After bridging the Russian River at Jenner, SR 1 continues to wind along the rugged coast to Fort Ross, Salt Point State Parks, and the planned community of Sea Ranch.\n\nMendocino County\nSR 1 then crosses the Gualala River and enters Mendocino County. The highway enters the city of Point Arena, in which it becomes Main Street, before following School Street to the northwest and then becoming Shoreline Highway once again. It bridges the Garcia River and then, near Elk, the Navarro River, where it meets SR 128.\nAt the town of Albion, the Albion River is spanned by the Albion River Bridge, the only remaining wooden trestle bridge on the highway. SR 1 then passes through Little River and Van Damme State Park, crosses Big River and passes through Mendocino Headlands State Park and the Victorian community of Mendocino. Continuing north, SR 1 crosses Russian Gulch State Park on the Frederick W. Panhorst Bridge, and passes through the town of Caspar. It passes through a roundabout just south of the intersection with the western terminus of SR 20, where it widens to two lanes, then bridges the Noyo River at Noyo, becomes Main Street of Fort Bragg, and crosses the California Western Railroad.\nNorth of Fort Bragg as a two-lane highway again, SR 1 passes MacKerricher State Park and the towns of Cleone and Inglenook before crossing Ten Mile River. After passing Westport-Union Landing State Beach, the road goes through a series of redwood-forested switchbacks before reaching Rockport. North of Rockport, the highway turns away from the Lost Coast to avoid steep and unstable highlands created by Mendocino Triple Junction uplift. The highway follows Cottaneva Creek inland through redwood-forested mountainous terrain before terminating at US 101 just outside Leggett.\n\nHistory\nSR 1 has become famous worldwide, but the highway was signed as several other routes prior to 1964. When the road was first envisioned in the World War I era, California highways were referred to by either a highway name or a route number. The route numbers were used by state highway planners and the Legislature from 1915 until 1964, but were never posted on highways, referred to by the auto clubs or public, nor used on maps. The SR 1 designation was first assigned in 1939. Various portions of SR 1 have been posted and referred to by various names and numbers over the years. State construction of what became SR 1 started after the state's third highway bond issue passed before 1910.\n\nSegments initially constructed\nEager for a direct coastal route between Ventura and Santa Barbara, civic boosters used locally raised funds to begin building the Rincon Sea Level Road in 1911. The route between the Ventura River and Carpinteria had been an unimproved route along small alluvial fan beaches that skirted coastal bluff rock outcroppings at low tide. Construction of the Southern Pacific Coast Line railroad had created a road flanked by riprap along this area. In order to make this part of the first coastal route for motorists driving from San Francisco to Los Angeles, they paved the road and built wooden causeways where the route flooded from the ocean waves. Local funding ran out, but the newly formed State Highway Commission took over and completed the road in 1913.\nOne of the most difficult routes to build was along the Big Sur coast. The state first approved building Route 56, or the Carmel-San Simeon Highway, to connect Big Sur to the rest of California in 1919. Federal funds were appropriated and in 1921 voters approved additional state funds. San Quentin State Prison set up three temporary prison camps to provide unskilled convict labor to help with road construction. One was set up by Little Sur River, one at Kirk Creek and a third was later established in the south at Anderson Creek. Inmates were paid 35 cents per day and had their prison sentences reduced in return. The route necessitated construction of 33 bridges, the largest of which was the Bixby Bridge. Six more concrete arch bridges were built between Point Sur and Carmel.\nAfter 18 years of construction, aided by New Deal funds during the Great Depression, the paved two-lane road was completed and opened on June 17, 1937. The road was initially called the Carmel-San Simeon Highway (Route 56), but was better known as the Roosevelt Highway, honoring the current President Franklin D. Roosevelt. A 1921 law extended Route 56 south over the county road to Cambria.\nRoute 60, from Oxnard via the coast to San Juan Capistrano, was extended from Oxnard to El Rio (midway to Ventura, now the site of the Oxnard Boulevard interchange with US 101), in 1925. At Point Mugu, a path for the highway was cut through the mountains using surplus World War I explosives, thus creating Mugu Rock. The 1921 legislation, in theory, made Route 60 a continuous coastal loop, with both ends at what became US 101 in Oxnard and at Capistrano Beach (since 1964 the southern terminus of SR 1 at Interstate 5 in Orange County). Route 56 was extended further south from Cambria to connect to present-day US 101 in San Luis Obispo in 1931.\nThe route from San Simeon to Carmel (connecting with existing county highways at each end) was one of two sections designated as SR 1. It and Route 60 were intended as links in a continuous coastal roadway from Oregon to Mexico,\nA large expansion of the state highway system in 1933 resulted in Route 56 being extended in both directions. To the south, a second section was added, beginning at Pismo Beach on US 101 (Route 2) and heading south through Guadalupe and Lompoc to rejoin US 101 at a junction called Los Cruces (sic), just north of Gaviota Pass. (A short piece near Orcutt and Los Alamos had been part of Route 2, which originally followed present SR 135 from Los Alamos to Santa Maria.) To the north, Route 56 was continued along the coast from Carmel through Santa Cruz to San Francisco. Several discontinuous pieces were added north of San Francisco, one from Route 1 (US 101) north of the Golden Gate to the county line near Valley Ford, another from the Russian River near Jenner (where the new Route 104 ended) to Westport, and a third from Ferndale to Route 1 near Fernbridge. Except for the gaps in Route 56 north of San Francisco, these additions completed the coastal highway, with other sections formed by Routes 1, 2, and 71.\nThe section of SR 1 from Santa Monica to Oxnard, via Malibu, went out to contract in 1925 as \"Coast Boulevard\", but was designated \"Theodore Roosevelt Highway\" when it was dedicated in 1929. Before the completion of its present alignment in 1937, a narrow, winding, steep road known as Pedro Mountain Road connected Montara with Pacifica. That highway was completed in 1914 and provided competition to the Ocean Shore Railroad, which operated between San Francisco and Tunitas Creek from 1907 to 1920. SR 1 also used to run along the coast between Pacifica and Daly City, but this segment was damaged and rendered unusable after a 5.3 magnitude earthquake on March 22, 1957. A small stub remains near Thornton Beach.\nRoute 56 along Big Sur was incorporated into the state highway system and re-designated as SR 1 in 1939. The section of road along the Big Sur Coast was declared the first State Scenic Highway in 1965, and in 1966 the first lady, Lady Bird Johnson, led the official designation ceremony at Bixby Bridge. The route was designated as an All American Road by the US Government.\n\nSigns first posted\nSR 1 signs first went up after California decided to number its highways, in 1934. The section for Humboldt, Mendocino, Sonoma, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Cruz, Monterey, San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties was posted as SR 1, that section of the road known Route 56 (Las Cruces to Fernbridge). For Ventura, Los Angeles and Orange counties, Route 60 (San Juan Capistrano to the Oxnard area) became SR 3, and a few SR 3 signs were actually posted. The SR 3 signs were replaced by US 101 Alt. shields by 1936, as the road was built out; this change also allowed the extension of US 66 to end at another U.S. Route, in Santa Monica.\nThe gaps of non-state highway along the northern coast were finally filled in by the Legislature in 1951, though the State Department of Public Works was not required to maintain the newly added portions immediately. A connection from near Rockport to Legislative Route 1 (signed US 101) at Leggett was also added to the Legislative Route 56 definition, as the existing county road north from Rockport to Ferndale had not yet been paved.\nThe state Legislature in 1963 tossed out the old conflicting Legislative Route Numbers (1964 renumbering), got rid of some famous old U.S. routes, and renumbered many state highways. It abolished US 101A in Los Angeles, Orange and Ventura counties and renumbered it as SR 1. The Rockport to Leggett connection then became State Route 208. The cover of \"California Highways\" magazine in fall 1964 shows state engineers posting the new shield at Point Mugu. The same year, the Legislature by state law named SR 1 \"Pacific Coast Highway\" in Orange, Los Angeles and Ventura counties, \"Cabrillo Highway\" from Santa Barbara north to San Francisco, and \"Shoreline Highway\" from Marin County to its northern terminus. Many cities, however, did not change the name of city streets that are part of SR 1, such as Lincoln and Sepulveda boulevards in Los Angeles, Santa Monica and El Segundo; and Junipero Serra and Park Presidio boulevards in San Francisco. Several other cities and communities like Newport Beach and Bodega Bay merely named their respective city streets as \"Coast Highway\".\n\nModern alignments\nThe freeway portion of SR 1 from Highway 68 in Monterey to Munras Avenue opened in 1956\u20131960. The segment from Munras Avenue to the northern border of Sand City and Seaside opened in 1968, and bypasses the original highway alignment of Munras Avenue and Fremont Street in Monterey, and Fremont Boulevard through Seaside. North of Seaside, the freeway was built over the original SR 1 alignment through Fort Ord in 1973. North of Fort Ord, SR 1 now veers to the left of the original alignment and bypasses Marina to the west. This segment including the interchange with SR 156 and the short, 2-lane Castroville Bypass opened in 1976. Originally SR 1 followed the SR 156 alignment to the SR 183 intersection in Castroville, then turned northwest, following the present-day SR 183 through Castroville before rejoining its existing alignment at the northern terminus of the Castroville Bypass.\nPlans to upgrade SR 1 to a freeway from its southern terminus all the way to Oxnard, including building an offshore causeway from the Santa Monica Pier to Topanga Canyon Boulevard south of Malibu, were ultimately killed by 1971 due to local opposition. In 1980, another section was added northwest of Ventura near Emma Wood State Beach, when several miles of the old two-lane alignment of U.S. Route 101 were posted as SR 1 where the freeway had bypassed it in about 1960. Then in 1988, the segment from Purisima Road in Lompoc to SR 135 was re-routed from Harris Grade Road to the former County Route S20 so it could directly serve Vandenberg Air Force Base.\nConstruction to bridge the gap in the Lost Coast region between Rockport and Ferndale was eventually abandoned. The steepness and related geotechnical challenges of the coastal mountains made this stretch of coastline too costly for highway builders to establish routes through the area. In 1984, SR 1 was then re-routed to replace State Highway 208, connecting Rockport and Leggett, while the segment between Ferndale and Fernbridge was renumbered as State Highway 211. Most of the coastline in the area is now part of Sinkyone Wilderness State Park and the King Range National Conservation Area.\nThe roadway along Devil's Slide, south of Pacifica, became the site of frequent deadly crashes and roadway-closing landslides. Beginning in 1958, Caltrans supported a plan to construct an inland bypass over Montara Mountain as an alternate route, but was eventually opposed by community and environmental groups who supported a tunnel instead. After decades of legal disputes, the Federal Highway Administration ordered Caltrans in 1995 to re-evaluate the proposed tunnel. Then on November 5, 1996, San Mateo County voters approved Measure T to change the county's official preference from the bypass to the tunnel. Ground eventually broke in 2005, and the Tom Lantos Tunnels opened in April 2013.\nIn 2014, two-way traffic was restored along the original PCH segment from Copper Lantern to Blue Lantern streets in the Dana Point city center after 25 years of one-way operation. During that period, only northbound traffic had flowed along this section of PCH while southbound traffic had been diverted onto the parallel Del Prado Avenue.\nSR 1 has never been planned to extend south into San Diego, or north into Crescent City, where I-5 (which replaced the US 101 designation and signage between Los Angeles and San Diego) and US 101 serve as the coastal highways in those areas, respectively.\n\nAs a cycling venue\nFor the 1932 Summer Olympics, the segment of the SR 1 between Oxnard and Santa Monica (then known as the Theodore Roosevelt Highway) hosted part of the road cycling events. Portions of SR 1 have also hosted stages of the Tour of California.\n\nMaintenance\nCalifornia's coastline is constantly changing and continually presents us with challenges. Through hard work and determination, we continue to keep this scenic highway open.\n\nLandslides\nFrequent landslides and erosion along the coast have caused portions of SR 1 to either be closed for long periods of time, or be re-routed entirely. Some of these include:\n\nA segment along the coast between Pacifica and Daly City in what is now Thornton Beach was damaged and rendered unusable after a 5.3 magnitude earthquake on March 22, 1957. SR 1 was then eventually re-routed to turn inland to join Interstate 280.\nThe Piedras Blancas Realignment Project plans to re-route the road up to 475 feet (145 m) further inland to avoid the expected coastal erosion from the Piedras Blancas Light Station to the Arroyo de la Cruz Bridge in San Luis Obispo County.\nBig Rock Mesa landslide in September 1983 in Malibu was one of the worst in state history. A total of 250 homes collapsed, cracked or slid off their foundation with 30 homes being condemned. The state agreed to pay forty million dollars as cutting through the hillside to build Pacific Coast Highway was a contributing cause.\nThe Devil's Slide area has been prone to major landslides. One slide in 1995 caused the road to be closed for five months, while another in 2006 led to a four-month closure. The Tom Lantos Tunnels, named after former U.S. Congressman Tom Lantos, opened in 2013 to bypass the area.\nIn 2011, major reconstruction was completed between Muir Beach and Stinson Beach, including the addition of a 523-foot-long (159 m), 20-foot-high (6.1 m), but mostly buried, retaining wall. This followed a four-month, $25 million reconstruction that repaired damage from a 2007 landslide.\nA March 2011 landslide in the Big Sur region forced Caltrans to close the highway for several months. A section south of Lucia that is also prone to frequent landslides, known as Pitkins Curve and Rain Rocks, was replaced with a bridge and a covered rock shed.\nDuring the winter of 2016\u20132017, the Big Sur region received more than 60 inches (150 cm) of rain. The road was closed or partially closed due to mudslides and landslides in at least six locations. On February 20, Caltrans declared that the Pfeiffer Canyon Bridge just south of Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park was damaged beyond repair, closing that segment of SR 1 for eight months, and effectively splitting Big Sur in half. Some businesses, cut off from customers and without access to supplies, were forced to close. For some residents, the only means of getting out was via helicopter. In March, Caltrans demolished the bridge and began construction of the replacement. The rebuilt bridge opened on October 13, 2017 at a cost of $24 million.\nAnother major slide at Mud Creek closed a 30-mile (48 km) stretch of the highway in May 2017. The huge slide at Mud Creek covered about one-third mile (0.54 km) of road with 40 feet (12 m) of dirt and rock. The slide was on a section of the road that was already closed due to smaller slides. The scale of the slide was compared to a very large slide during the winter of 1983\u20131984 that closed SR 1 for more than a year. A replacement roadway was built over the landslide and opened in July 2018, at a cost of $40 million.\nAfter heavy rainfall, a section of the highway at mile marker 30, near Rat Creek in Monterey County, collapsed into the ocean in January 2021.  It reopened in April 2021.\nMultiple landslides during successive storm systems in January 2023 forced the closure of nearly 40 miles (64 km) of the highway. As of April 2023, over 25 miles (40 km) of the highway remain closed.\nLandslides in March 2024 forced the closure of a 1.4-mile (2.3 km) stretch north of the Rocky Creek Bridge in the Big Sur region.\n\nFuture projects\nIn 2014, Caltrans relinquished the portion of SR 1 in Oxnard along Oxnard Boulevard. The plan is then for PCH between Pleasant Valley Road and US 101 to be re-routed from Oxnard Boulevard onto Rice Avenue. That segment of Rice Avenue includes a railroad grade crossing at 5th Avenue that was the site of the February 2015 Oxnard train derailment, which eventually led to one death and 29 injuries. This was the twelfth accident at the crossing in ten years. An overpass has been planned at that site for almost two decades, but funding has not been available in Ventura County for the estimated $35 million grade separation project.\nIn 2015, a $20 million project was proposed to add over 150 safety improvements to the stretch of the highway in Malibu. This follows a string of fatal accidents in the area, including one involving Caitlyn Jenner that claimed another person's life.\nThe Calera Parkway project proposes to widen the non-freeway segment in Pacifica between the Rockaway Beach and Vallemar districts, but is facing opposition by local residents and environmentalists.\n\nMajor intersections\nExcept where prefixed with a letter, postmiles were measured on the road as it was in 1964, based on the alignment that existed at the time, and do not necessarily reflect current mileage. R reflects a realignment in the route since then, M indicates a second realignment, L refers to an overlap due to a correction or change, and T indicates postmiles classified as temporary (for a full list of prefixes, see California postmile \u00a7 Official postmile definitions). Segments that remain unconstructed or have been relinquished to local control may be omitted. The numbers reset at county lines; the start and end postmiles in each county are given in the county column.\n\nIn popular culture\nTim Buckley's 1969 album Happy Sad includes a song with the title \"Love from Room 109 at the Islander (On Pacific Coast Highway)\".\nIn 2002, the Decemberists released a song titled \"California One\/Youth and Beauty Brigade\" on their album Castaways and Cutouts.\nIn 2012, the Beach Boys released a song titled \"Pacific Coast Highway\". Described by critics as \"introspective\", \"autumnal\", and \"hymnlike\", the song takes the perspective of an aged person driving down the highway during sunset as he reflects on his advancing years in life, deciding that he is more comfortable living alone.\n\nSee also\nCalifornia Roads portal\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nCaltrans: State Route 1 highway conditions\nCaltrans Traffic Conditions Map\nCalifornia Highway Patrol Traffic Incidents\nBay Area FasTrak \u2013 includes toll information on the Golden Gate Bridge and the other Bay Area toll facilities\nState Route 1, California @ AARoads.com\nRoute 1 at California Highways\nCalifornia's Highway 1, CNN-TravelGuide Pursuits\nCalifornia's Pacific Coast Highway from National Geographic\nGuide to California's Highway 1 at Travel + Leisure\nCalifornia Highway 1 Attractions at USA Today\n1958 plans for the conversion of Junipero Serra Boulevard in San Francisco to freeway\n1964 plans for the conversion of Park Presidio Boulevard in San Francisco to freeway\nUltimate California Highway 1 road trip at Sunset Magazine","174":"Pandora's Box was a nightclub and coffeehouse on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood, California. It was at the center of the Sunset Strip curfew riots in 1966.\n\nHistory\nIn the late 1950s Pandora's Box was a popular coffeehouse located at 8118 Sunset Boulevard, on the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Crescent Heights Boulevard. Home to some of the more adventurous artists in town, Pandora's Box hosted up-and-coming jazz musicians such as Les McCann and Carla Bley, while artist Burt Shonberg adorned the interior of the club with a mural similar to his works in the famous Cafe Frankenstein and The Purple Onion.\nIn 1962, the club was bought by disc jockey and Shindig! host Jimmy O'Neill. O'Neill's trendsetting booking policy made Pandora's Box the center of the Sunset Strip youth scene. The club featured performances by artists such as the Beach Boys, the Byrds and Sonny & Cher.\nWhile the club itself did not serve alcohol, Pandora's Box very soon became a hangout where underage drinking was not uncommon among people. Moreover, numerous complaints arose about drug use and loud music. Ultimately however, the biggest problem that arose for the club was the obstructions it caused upon traffic, a result of both its numerous visitors and its unfortunate location at one of the busiest intersections in the city.\nIn 1966, annoyed residents and business owners in the district had encouraged the passage of a strict 10:00 pm curfew and loitering law to reduce the traffic congestion and disturbances resulting from crowds of young club patrons. This was perceived by the young, local rock music fans as an infringement on their civil rights, and for weeks tensions and protests swelled. On Saturday, November 12, 1966, fliers were distributed along the Strip inviting people to demonstrate later that day. Hours before the protest one of L.A.'s rock 'n' roll radio stations announced there would be a rally at Pandora's Box. That evening, as many as a 1,000 youthful demonstrators, including such celebrities as Jack Nicholson and Peter Fonda (who was handcuffed by police), erupted in protest against the perceived repressive enforcement of these recently invoked curfew laws and the forced closure of Pandora's Box.\nThe unrest continued the next night and off and on throughout November and December, while Pandora's Box had already been forced to close its doors. Sonny & Cher, who got their start on the Strip as Caesar and Cleo, made an appearance in front of Pandora's Box in December, while on Christmas Day, Pandora's Box reopened for one night only. There, according to author Domenic Priore, Stephen Stills first publicly performed \"For What It's Worth, a song written in response to the riot.\"\nMeanwhile, the local administration had decided to get tough, and rescinded the \"youth permits\" of twelve of the Strip's clubs, thereby making them off-limits to anybody under 21. In November 1966, the Los Angeles City Council voted to acquire and demolish the Pandora's Box. The club was eventually demolished in early August 1967.\n\nLegacy\nBuffalo Springfield's 1967 hit single \"For What It's Worth (Stop, Hey, What's That Sound)\" was written by group member Stephen Stills in response to the riots around Pandora's Box. Later, Stills said: \"Riot is a ridiculous name, it was a funeral for Pandora's Box. But it looked like a revolution.\"\n\"Plastic People\", a song recorded by Frank Zappa and The Mothers of Invention in November 1966, directly mentions Pandora's Box in its lyrics: \"I hear the sound of marching feet... Down Sunset Boulevard to Crescent Heights... and there... at Pandora's box... We are confronted with... a vast Quantity of... Plastic people...\".\nThe 1967 film Riot on Sunset Strip is a fictionalized depiction of the events around Pandora's Box and was filmed and released within four months of the protest.\nThe nightclub is anachronistically featured in Quentin Tarantino's 2019 film Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (the film is set in 1969).\n\nSee also\nLondon Fog\nRoxy Theatre\nSunset Boulevard\nSunset Strip\nWest Hollywood, California\nWhisky a Go Go\n\n\n== References ==","175":"Pacific Palisades is a neighborhood in the Westside region of Los Angeles, California, situated about 20 miles (32 km) west of Downtown Los Angeles.\nPacific Palisades was formally founded in 1921 by a Methodist organization, and in the years that followed became a refuge for Jewish artists and intellectuals fleeing the Holocaust. The Palisades would later be sought after by celebrities and other high-profile individuals seeking privacy. It is known for its seclusion, being a close-knit community with a small-town feel, Mediterranean climate, hilly topography, natural environment, abundance of parkland and hiking trails, a 3-mile (4.8 km) strip of coastline, and for being home to several architecturally significant homes. As of 2021, the community's population was 23,156.\nPacific Palisades is a largely residential community and does not attract many tourists other than day visitors to Gladstones Malibu, the local beaches, the Getty Villa or the Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine.\nNicknamed \"the Palisades\" and \"Pali\" by surfers and locals, the Palisades coast spans from after Sorrento Beach in Santa Monica to the south, and ends at Sunset Point Beach and Malibu to the north. Beaches along the Pacific Palisades coast include: Will Rogers State Beach, Sunset Point Beach, and one of the few unofficially gay beaches in Los Angeles, Ginger Rogers Beach. The many parks within the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area lie along the ridges above the community, along with local parks that include Will Rogers State Historic Park.\nThe Palisades is bounded by Brentwood to the east, Malibu to the west, Santa Monica to the southeast, the Santa Monica Bay to the southwest, Topanga and the Santa Monica Mountains to the north.\n\nEtymology\nThe name \"Pacific Palisades\" comes from the term \"palisades,\" a geological formation consisting of a series of cliff-like bluffs situated by a body of water, in this case the Pacific Ocean, and also for the area's purported resemblance to The Palisades on the west side of the lower Hudson River.\n\nHistory\nNative American period\nArcheological evidence shows Native American Indians living in the Santa Monica Mountains and the surrounding area including Pacific Palisades for over 10,000 years. Prior to European contact, the western sections of the Santa Monica mountains were inhabited by the Tongva people. The closest Tongva settlement to Pacific Palisades with a written record is the village of Topa'nga. The village of Topa'nga sits on the western-most edge of Tongva territory, neighboring the territory of the Chumash people to the north. Due to this close proximity to the Chumash, the culture in western Tongva territory contained elements of Chumash influence.\n\nMexican period\nThe land that became Pacific Palisades was originally within the boundaries of Rancho Boca de Santa Monica, granted by the governor of California during the Mexican period to Francisco Marquez and Ysidro Reyes in 1839. The Ysidro Reyes Adobe was the first adobe home ever built in Santa Monica Canyon, erected in the year 1838 on land now known as Pampas Ricas Blvd in Pacific Palisades. Sketches of adobe dwelling exist in the collection of the UCLA Library. A memorial plaque sits in a boulder on Pampas Ricas Blvd commemorating the adobe house, dedicated in the 1950s. Ysidro Reyes died in 1863. Reyes left his portion of Rancho Boca de Santa Monica to his widow, Maria Antonia Villa, who sold it to developer and railroad magnate Robert Symington Baker in 1875.\n\n1911-1922\nIn 1911, film director Thomas Ince constructed his film studio, \"Inceville\", which was on a 460-acre (1.9 km2) tract of land he leased called Bison Ranch at Sunset Blvd. and Pacific Coast Highway in the Santa Monica Mountains. Today this is where the Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine is located. By the following year, Ince had earned enough money to purchase the ranch and was able to lease an additional 18,000 acres (73 km2) lot in what is now in the Palisades Highlands neighborhood. stretching 7.5 miles (12.1 km) up Santa Ynez Canyon. This was the first major development built in the Palisades since the Mexican rancho era.\n\nThis was the first studio in the area which featured silent stages, production offices, printing labs, a commissary large enough to serve lunch to hundreds of workers, dressing rooms, props houses, elaborate sets, all in one central location.\nWhen Inceville was completed, the streets were lined with many types of structures, from humble cottages to mansions, mimicking the style and architecture of different countries. Extensive outdoor western sets were built and used on the site for several years. According to Katherine La Hue in her book, Pacific Palisades: Where the Mountains Meet the Sea:\n\nInce invested $35,000 in building, stages and sets ... a bit of Switzerland, a Puritan settlement, a Japanese village ... beyond the breakers, an ancient brigantine weighed anchor, cutlassed men swarming over the sides of the ship, while on the shore performing cowboys galloped about, twirling their lassos in pursuit of errant cattle ... The main herds were kept in the hills, where Ince also raised feed and garden produce. Supplies of every sort were needed to house and feed a veritable army of actors, directors and subordinates.\nWhile the cowboys, Native Americans and assorted workers lived at \"Inceville,\" the main actors came from Los Angeles and other communities as needed, often taking the red trolley cars to the Long Wharf in what is now the Temescal Canyon neighborhood, where buckboards conveyed them to the set.\nInce lived in a house overlooking the vast studio in what is now the Marquez Knolls neighborhood. Indeed, \"Inceville\" became a prototype for Hollywood film studios of the future, with a studio head (Ince), producers, directors, production managers, production staff, and writers all working together under one organization and under the supervision of a General Manager, Fred J. Balshofer. On January 16, 1916, a fire broke out at Inceville, the first of many that eventually destroyed all of the buildings. Ince later gave up on the studio and sold it to William S. Hart, who renamed it \"Hartville.\" Three years later, Hart sold the lot to Robertson-Cole Pictures Corporation, which continued filming there until 1922. La Hue writes that \"the place was virtually a ghost town when the last remnants of \"Inceville\" were burned on July 4, 1922, leaving only a \"weatherworn old church, which stood sentinel over the charred ruins.\"\n\n1921\u20131931\nA decade later, the Rev. Charles H. Scott and the Southern California Methodist Episcopal Church bought the land; in 1922, Scott founded Pacific Palisades, envisioning an elaborate religious-intellectual commune. Believers snapped up choice lots and lived in tents during construction. By 1925, the Palisades had 100 homes. In one subdivision, streets were named in alphabetical order for Methodist missionaries (the \"Alphabet Streets\"). The tents eventually were replaced by cabins, then by bungalows, and ultimately by multimillion-dollar homes. The climate of the area was a big selling point. Temperatures are much cooler than inland Los Angeles during summer, but usually sunnier and less foggy than areas south along the coast (e.g. Santa Monica).\nPacific Palisades enjoyed steady growth throughout the Roaring 20s, but it was still a small, isolated community out on the edge of Los Angeles. It began to become less isolated with the paving of Sunset Boulevard\u00b1 in 1925, which brought an increased flow of traffic through the community and offered more convenient accessibility to nearby Westwood and Beverly Hills.\n1929 would prove to be a pivotal year in the history of the Palisades, and by that time the town consisted of only about 365 homes and about 1,000 residents who mostly resided in the so-called \"Alphabet Streets\" neighborhood, although residential construction was now expanding into what would later become the Castellammare, Huntington and Paseo Miramar neighborhoods. On August 18 of that year, the cornerstone was laid for the foundation of the Methodist Episcopal Church on Via de la Paz, which at that time was the community's only church. Directly across the street, planning was underway for the town's first permanent school building which would later become known as \"Palisades Elementary\", which was dedicated on June 12, 1931.\nIn 1928, the Los Angeles Police Department began renting temporary office space in the now-historic Business Block building for the price of $10 a month. The following year, a motorcycle officer was assigned to make nightly patrols in the area. The Palisades finally acquired its own fire station in 1929, located on Sunset, adjacent to where the local Chase Bank branch now stands in the Village neighborhood.\nBy the end of the decade, nearly all remaining open areas of Pacific Palisades were being developed, reflecting the areas booming growth and the Palisades' coastal allure. Golfers were enjoying the already acclaimed Riviera Country Club, opened in 1927. Later in the decade construction started on the Bel-Air Bay Club, opened in March 1930.\n\n1930\u2013present\nThe Palisades was a refuge for many German-Jewish and Austrian-Jewish intellectuals and artists fleeing from pre-war Germany and, later, from the Holocaust, many of whom associated with the Exilliteratur settled in Pacific Palisades, including Thomas Mann, Lion Feuchtwanger, Theodor W. Adorno, Vicki Baum, Herbert Zipper, and Emil Ludwig. Some of these Jewish refugees had previously sought refuge in the south of France (and had to flee due to the fall of France to the Vichy regime), and were surprised by the similarities with the Mediterranean climate and topography. Villa Aurora on Paseo Miramar, the Spanish colonial home of Feuchtwanger and his wife, Marta, became the focal point of the expatriate community, which was nicknamed \"Weimar by the Sea\". Some non-Jewish exiles who were married to people with Jewish ancestry chose to settle in the Palisades as well, such as Thomas Mann and his wife Katia Mann who resided at 1550 San Remo Drive in the Riviera neighborhood.\nFor many decades there was a virtual ban on the sale of alcoholic beverages in the district, and a Chinese restaurant, House of Lee, held the only liquor license. The Methodist Church created a Chautauqua Conference Grounds in Temescal Canyon. The Presbyterian Synod purchased the property in 1943 and used it as a private retreat center until the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy purchased the property in 1994 to become Temescal Gateway Park.\nThough the Palisades had a notable Jewish population since at least the 1930s, it was still largely Methodist until the 1970s. This is when the Palisades began to see an explosion of affluent Jewish migration, accompanied by the opening of a local landmark Mort's Deli, in 1972. The beloved landmark closed in 2007.\n\nGeography\nPacific Palisades is about 7 miles (11 kilometers) west of the UCLA campus. The Santa Monica Mountain range runs through the northern and eastern sections of Pacific Palisades, accessible through a series of trailheads.\nThe Pacific Palisades covers a total area of 24.31 square miles (63 km2), comprising 22.84 square miles (59.2 km2) of land and 1.47 square miles (3.8 km2) of water. The Palisades coast is about three miles (4.8 km) in length.\n\nClimate\nPacific Palisades has a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen Csb), and receives just enough annual precipitation to avoid semi-arid climate (BSh),. Daytime temperatures are generally temperate all year round. In winter, they average around 68 \u00b0F (20 \u00b0C) giving it a tropical feel although it is a few degrees too cool to be a true tropical climate on average due to cool night temperatures. Pacific Palisades has plenty of sunshine throughout the year, with an average of only 35 days with measurable precipitation annually.\nTemperatures in the Palisades exceed 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) on a dozen or so days in the year, from one day a month in April, May, June and November to three days a month in July, August, October and to five days in September. The average annual temperature of the sea is 63 \u00b0F (17 \u00b0C), from 58 \u00b0F (14 \u00b0C) in January to 68 \u00b0F (20 \u00b0C) in August. Hours of sunshine total more than 3,000 per year, from an average of 7 hours of sunshine per day in December to an average of 12 in July. Pacific Palisades, like much of the rest of the southern California coast, is subject to a late spring\/early summer weather phenomenon called \"June Gloom\". This involves overcast or foggy skies in the morning that yield to sun by early afternoon.\nPacific Palisades averages 14.93 in (379 mm) of precipitation annually, mainly occurring between November and March, generally in the form of moderate rain showers, but sometimes as heavy rainfall during winter storms. Rainfall is usually higher in the neighborhoods located in the hills and coastal slopes of the Santa Monica Mountains, such as the Highlands and Castellammare; due to orographic uplift. Summer days are typically rainless. Rarely, an incursion of moist air from the south or east can bring brief thunderstorms in late summer, especially to the mountains. The coast gets slightly less rainfall, while the inland and mountain areas get considerably more. Years of average rainfall are rare. The usual pattern is year to year variability, with a short string of dry years of 5\u201310 in (130\u2013250 mm) rainfall, followed by one or two wet years with more than 20 in (510 mm). Wet years are usually associated with warm water El Ni\u00f1o conditions in the Pacific, dry years with cooler water La Ni\u00f1a episodes. A series of rainy days can bring floods to the lowlands and mudslides to the hills, especially after wildfires have denuded the slopes.\nBoth freezing temperatures and snowfall are extremely rare in the hills and canyon ridges and along the coast, with the last occurrence of a 32 \u00b0F (0 \u00b0C) reading being on. While the most recent snowfall occurred in January 2021, it has also occurred several other times in recorded history, the second-most recent being in February 2019, with snow falling in some areas of the Palisades as recently as January 2021. At the official downtown station, the highest recorded temperature is 113 \u00b0F (45 \u00b0C) on September 27, 2010, while the lowest is 28 \u00b0F (\u22122 \u00b0C), on January 4, 1949.

This content was estimated to be around 125 billion digital pages.\nThe company began operations as a producer of microfilm products, subsequently shifting to electronic publishing, and later grew through acquisitions. On December 1, 2021, Clarivate bought ProQuest from Cambridge Information Group for $5.3 billion in what was described as \"huge deal in the library and information publishing world\". Clarivate said that the operational concept behind the acquisition was integrating ProQuest's products and applications with Web of Science.\n\nBusinesses\nProQuest was founded as a microfilm publisher. It began publishing doctoral dissertations in 1939, has published more than 3 million searchable dissertations and theses, and is designated as an offsite digital archive for the United States Library of Congress. The company's scholarly content includes dissertations and theses, primary source material, ebooks, scholarly journals, historical and current newspapers and periodicals, data sources, and other content of interest to researchers. ProQuest Video Preservation and Discovery Service, allows libraries to preserve and provide access to their proprietary audio and video collections.\nIn May 2014, ProQuest LLC also operated businesses under the following names:\n\nBowker provides bibliographic information management solutions to publishers, libraries and booksellers, and is the ISBN Agency for the United States.\nDialog is an online information service with more than 1.4 billion unique records curated for corporate, business and government researchers, with a focus on pharmaceutical, engineering and patent research.\nEBL (Ebook Library), an ebook aggregator with a catalog of titles from academic publishers, serves academic, corporate and research libraries while supporting emerging collection development models such as patron-driven acquisition.\nebrary offers access to ebook collections, by subscription or a perpetual archive model, in subject packages tailored for academic, corporate, government, public and high school libraries.\n\nHistory\nEugene Power, a 1927 BA and 1930 MBA graduate of the University of Michigan, founded the company as University Microfilms in 1938, preserving works from the British Museum on microfilm. By June 1938, Power worked in two rented rooms from a downtown Ann Arbor funeral parlor, specializing in microphotography to preserve library collections. In his autobiography Edition of One, Power details the development of the company, including how University Microfilms assisted the OSS during World War II. This work mainly involved filming maps and European newspapers so they could be shipped back and forth overseas more cheaply and discreetly.\nPower also noticed a niche market in dissertations publishing. Students were often forced to publish their own works in order to finish their doctoral degree. Dissertations could be published more cheaply as microfilm than as books. ProQuest still publishes so many dissertations that its Dissertations and Theses collection (formerly called Digital Dissertations) has been declared the official U.S. off-site repository of the Library of Congress.\nThe idea of universal adoption of microfilm publication of doctoral dissertations was furthered considerably by two articles researched and written by a then recent recipient of the doctorate in history at Stanford University.  Vaughn Davis Bornet seized on the idea and published \"Doctoral Dissertations and the Stream of Scholarship\" and \"Microfilm Publication of Doctoral Dissertations\".\nAs the dissertations market grew, the company expanded into filming newspapers and periodicals. The company's main newspaper database is ProQuest Newsstand.\nIn 1962, Xerox acquired the company for 51,750 shares of Xerox common stock, worth about $7.9 million. Under Xerox's ownership, the name of the company changed several times, from University Microfilms to Xerox University Microfilms, to University Microfilms International, then shortened to UMI. In 1985, it was purchased from Xerox by Bell & Howell. In 1986, UMI acquired Data Courier, owner of ABI\/INFORM, from the Bingham family.\nIn the 1980s, UMI began producing CD-ROMs that stored databases of periodicals abstracts and indexes. At a time when modem connections were slow and expensive, it was more efficient to mail database CD-ROMs regularly to subscribing libraries, who installed the discs on dedicated PCs. The ProQuest brand name was first used for databases on CD-ROM. An online service called ProQuest Direct was launched in 1995; its name was later shortened to just ProQuest. The bibliographic databases are mainly sold to schools, universities and libraries.\nIn 1998, the company announced the \"Digital Vault Initiative\", purported to include 5.5 billion images digitized from UMI microfilm, including some of the best existing copies of major newspapers dating back 100 to 150 years, and Early English books dating back to the 15th century. While work continues to digitize the contents of the microfilm vault, ProQuest is already providing navigation of 125 billion digital pages, including nearly 20 million pages of newspaper content dating from pre-Revolutionary War America.\nIn 1999, the company name changed to Bell & Howell Information and Learning, and then in 2001 to ProQuest Information and Learning; Bell & Howell renamed itself the ProQuest Company.\nAlso in 1999, the company acquired Chadwyck-Healey, a one-time microfilm publishing company that was one of the first to produce full-text CD-ROM databases. This acquisition gave Proquest ownership of a 100+ person publishing operation based in Cambridge, England and became the basis for a substantial overseas expansion.\nDuring the 2000\u20132004 fiscal years, as well as the first three quarters of the 2005 fiscal year, ProQuest systematically overstated its net income. Cumulatively, pre-tax profits were overstated by 129.9 million dollars (or about 31 percent). In 2008, Voyager Learning Company and ProQuest's CFO (from the time of the earnings overstatements) settled SEC \"charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC's complaint\".\nIn 2001 ProQuest acquired Norman Ross Publishing, a small New York based microfilm publisher.\nIn 2002 ProQuest acquired bigchalk.com, a company founded in 1999 with the combined assets of ProQuest's K-12 division and Infonautics Inc.'s K-12 business.\nIn 2004, ProQuest Information and Learning acquired Seattle start-up Serials Solutions, a venture providing access management and search services for content hosted by other companies.\nAlso in 2004, the company acquired Copley Publishing Group.\nIn 2005 three ProQuest executives formed a distribution company called National Archive Publishing Co, of XanEdu, UMI, and Digital Service Operations. The building that would house this new company stood at 300 Zeeb Road in Scio, home to nearly 6 billion pages of information.\nIn 2006, ProQuest Company, then the parent company of ProQuest Information and Learning, sold it to Cambridge Information Group, owner of R. R. Bowker. From the time of this sale, this article follows the history of ProQuest Information and Learning, not ProQuest Company.  (ProQuest Company subsequently renamed itself to Voyager Learning Company, and later became part of Cambium Learning Group.)\nIn 2007, ProQuest Information and Learning was merged with CSA to form ProQuest CSA. Later that year it was renamed ProQuest LLC.\nIn 2008, ProQuest LLC acquired complete ownership of RefWorks, a web-based citation manager of which it had been part owner since 2001. RefWorks was merged with ProQuest's existing COS business to form RefWorks\/COS.\nAlso in 2008, ProQuest acquired Dialog, a major online database firm, from Thomson Reuters.\nIn 2010, ProQuest acquired two properties from LexisNexis, the Congressional Information Service (CIS) and University Publications of America (UPA). CIS produced one of the world's most exhaustive online collections of legislative content and highly respected statistical works, while UPA included deep historical content sets. The acquisition included digital products and an expansive microfilm vault that would leverage ProQuest's strength in conversion from film to searchable electronic formats.\nIn 2011, ProQuest acquired Ebrary, an online digital library of full texts of over 170,000 scholarly e-books. In 2013, ProQuest acquired Ebook Library (EBL), with plans to combine ebrary and EBL into a single e-book platform.\nIn 2014, ProQuest acquired Pi2 Solutions, a privately owned company specializing in Drug Safety Triager (DST) & Product Literature Database (PLD) systems for the biopharmaceutical industry. The company aligned Pi2 Solutions with its ProQuest Dialog corporate information service.\nIn 2015, ProQuest acquired SiPX and Coutts Information Services, including the MyiLibrary platform and the Online Acquisitions and Selection Information System (OASIS).\nIn October 2015, ProQuest acquired Ex Libris. It was to merge the Workflow Solutions division of ProQuest, which included the former Serials Solutions, into Ex Libris, with the enlarged entity to be named \"Ex Libris, a ProQuest Company\".\nIn June 2016, ProQuest acquired Alexander Street Press, a provider of streaming videos and ebooks.\nIn January 2020, ProQuest acquired Innovative Interfaces, Inc., a provider of technology solutions to academic and public libraries.\nOn 17 May 2021, it was announced that Clarivate would acquire ProQuest.  On July 28, 2021, Clarivate announced that the acquisition was delayed due to a Federal Trade Commission antitrust probe. On December 1, 2021, Clarivate successfully completed the acquisition of ProQuest.\n\nProducts\nAmong the products the company sells to clients such as public and research libraries are:\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website","179":"The Citizens Commission on Human Rights International (CCHR) is an anti-psychiatry lobbying organization established in 1969 by the Church of Scientology and psychiatrist Thomas Szasz.:\u200a170\u200a:\u200a294\u200a Headquartered in Los Angeles, California, its stated mission is to \"eradicate abuses committed under the guise of mental health and enact patient and consumer protections.\" It is regarded by most non-Scientologists as a Scientology front group whose purpose is to push the organization's anti-psychiatry agenda.\n\nCampaigns\nThe group has organized media campaigns against various psychiatrists, psychiatric organizations and pharmaceutical companies, including Eli Lilly, the manufacturer of Prozac. The campaign against Eli Lilly in 1991 caused Prozac's market share of antidepressants to drop from 25% to 21%.\nThe group campaigned against the use of Ritalin for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, a disorder which the organization dismisses as nonexistent. The campaign was part of the Ritalin class action lawsuits against Novartis (the manufacturer of Ritalin), CHADD (Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder), and the American Psychiatric Association (APA); all five lawsuits were dismissed in 2002.\nIn 2003, the CCHR presented a report with the title \"The Silent Death of America's Children\" to the New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, with case histories of several dozen under-aged psychiatric patients who had died as a result of psychotropic drug treatment and restraint measures in the 1990s and early 2000s.\nIn 2004, Massachusetts state senators Richard T. Moore and Charles E. Shannon Jr. sponsored a bill requiring doctors to provide parents with information about a psychotropic medication's side effects and obtain their signature before prescribing any psychotropic drugs. Though Moore claimed in an interview to be unaware of CCHR's involvement, Shannon had worked with CCHR on the legislation. Kevin Hall, New England Director for CCHR, claimed to have drafted the bill. The medical establishment widely disagreed with the bill, which it dubbed the \"Scientology Bill\". Others opposing the bill included the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health, the Massachusetts Psychiatric Society, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Parent\/Professional Advocacy League.\nOn 5 October 2006, National Mental Health Screening Day, the CCHR picketed outside of Riverside Community Care in Wakefield, Massachusetts, holding a protest rally against mental health screening. According to journalist Gary Band in the Wakefield Observer, \"The protest fell somewhat flat because Riverside has not conducted these screenings since 2001.\"\nAccording to a report from the National Center for Biotechnology Information, CCHR has uncovered real cases of faulty psychiatric care, which gave them some credibility; conversely, CCHR has been accused of using pseudo-science and false information to disingenuously validate their claims.\nIn its early years, the CCHR achieved victory in a 1969 Pennsylvania case involving Victor Gy\u0151ry, a Hungarian refugee who had been committed to a psychiatric hospital against his will in April of that year. The police officers committing Gy\u0151ry said he had tried to kill himself. Doctors at Haverford State Hospital, failing to realise that Gy\u0151ry spoke very little English and was trying to address them in Hungarian, judged him \"incoherent\" and diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia. The hospital refused Gy\u0151ry's request for legal representation, and administered drugs and electroshock treatment to him against his will over a three-month period. An aide at the hospital eventually notified the CCHR, who, under an initiative led by Szasz and lawyer John Joseph Matonis, took the case to court and secured Gy\u0151ry's release.\nThe CCHR continued to lobby for legislative reform on mental health issues such as the keeping of detailed computer records on involuntarily committed patients and their families, and \"drug experimentation\" without patients' consent. The CCHR would typically request a tour of a psychiatric hospital, issue a public report based on patient testimony and other sources, and then push for legal investigations and reform. The early focus was on involuntary commitment procedures.\n\nChelmsford Hospital and DST\nFrom 1988 to 1990 the Australian government held the Chelmsford Royal Commission inquiry into Deep Sleep Therapy (DST). For a decade prior, the CCHR had been pushing for an investigation of the Chelmsford Private Hospital in New South Wales, and its head, Dr. Harry Bailey, who had been practising DST from 1963 to 1979.\nThe inquiry discovered that deep sleep therapy had killed 24 patients, not counting patients who had killed themselves, and close to a thousand had had brain damage. Of the former patients, 152 received reparations from a fund totaling in excess of 5 million dollars.\nChelmsford Hospital was forced to close in 1990, and two of its psychiatric staff were made to face charges in 1992. Dr. Bailey himself stepped down in 1979 due to the CCHR's protest campaign, and committed suicide by drug overdose in 1985, the night before he was subpoenaed to appear in court. His suicide note read, in part: \"Let it be known that the Scientologists and the forces of madness have won.\"\n\nControversies\nRissmiller labels CCHR as a radical antipsychiatry organization. It encourages the arrest and incarceration of psychiatrists for their alleged crimes against humanity because L. Ron Hubbard had written, \"There is not one institutional psychiatrist alive who ... could not be arraigned and convicted of extortion, mayhem and murder.\"\nThe CCHR is a front group for the Church of Scientology, which sponsors the organization. In 1993, the US Internal Revenue Service granted CCHR tax exemption as part of an agreement with the Church of Scientology International and Religious Technology Center (RTC) under which the RTC took responsibility for CCHR's tax liabilities.\nThe CCHR has been criticized by journalist Andrew Gumbel for \"crudeness\" and \"paranoia\" in its criticism of psychiatry.\nIn 1988, the CCHR claimed that Professor Sir Martin Roth of Newcastle University had used LSD in tests on mental patients in the 1960s. The statements were publicized in the Northern Echo newspaper, which was ordered by an English court to pay \"very substantial\" libel damages to Roth after the court found that CCHR's claims were \"highly defamatory\" and \"utterly false.\"\nJan Eastgate, President of the CCHR and winner of an International Association of Scientologists Freedom Medal award, has been implicated in covering up the sexual abuse of an 11-year-old girl in the Australian branch of the church. Eastgate was head of the Australian CCHR at the time and the girl was abused by her Scientologist stepfather between the ages of 8 and 11 years. Eastgate, who denied the allegations, labelling them \"egregiously false\", was arrested on 30 March 2011 on charges of perverting the course of justice but later released on conditional bail. All charges were dropped against Eastgate after an investigation by the New South Wales Director of Public Prosecution found that there was not enough substantiating evidence.\nIn the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks, CCHR promulgated a conspiracy theory assigning responsibility for the attacks to Ayman al-Zawahiri, alleging that, as Osama bin Laden's personal psychiatrist (although he is actually a surgeon), he was the principal mastermind behind the attacks and had brainwashed bin Laden using pain, drugs and hypnosis.\n\nPsychiatry: An Industry of Death\nHoused in CCHR's Los Angeles building is the Psychiatry: An Industry of Death exhibit which was opened in 2005.\n\nI was charged with overseeing building a new museum\u2014the Psychiatry: An Industry of Death Museum. The entire presentation was designed to document how psychiatry is \"driven by profit\" rather than by care for patient well-being. Every video, artifact, and display was an overblown attempt to show how the profession is to blame for the Holocaust, for destroying artists through barbaric \"treatments,\" for hooking children on drugs, and much, much more. There are small kernels of truth contained in the hype\u2014just enough to give it a speck of credibility\u2014while creating the impression that all psychiatrists are conniving monsters out of B movies. I put together a team and approved the design and content of this extraordinary spectacle of over-the-top propaganda.\nOf the anti-psychiatry exhibit, Andrew Gumbel of Los Angeles City Beat stated \"it is one thing to assert that psychiatry has had its abuses, quite another to say the profession in and of itself is evil ... this is the classic stuff of paranoid conspiracy theory\".\nCCHR also has a travelling exhibit of the same name, which National Post writer Kevin Libin called \"a fright show\" where they show the 2006 two-hour film of the same name, Psychiatry: An Industry of Death. Two individuals featured in the film, Holocaust scholar Michael Berenbaum and bioethics scholar Arthur Caplan, have rejected the attack on psychiatry and psychology. Berenbaum stated that \"I have known psychiatrists to be of enormous assistance to people deeply important to me in my life,\" and Caplan complained that he had been taped without being told what the film was about, and called the producers \"smarmy and dishonest.\"\n\nDocumentaries\nCCHR have produced a number of documentaries promoting their view of modern psychiatry. These include:\n\nThe Hidden Enemy,\nMaking A Killing,\nPrescription for Violence,\nThe Marketing of Madness (see chapter below),\nDead Wrong, and\nPsychiatry: An Industry of Death, which was made to accompany the CCHR's exhibit of the same name.\n\nThe Marketing of Madness: Are We All Insane?\nThe Marketing of Madness is a documentary which alleges that the mental health industry is an unscientific field driven solely by the profit motive, to the detriment of patients.\nOne of the interviewees is Claudia Keyworth, an advocate of 'Bio-Energetic medicine' who believes that healing is best accomplished using the \"energy field of the human body\". On the topic of mental illness, she asserts: \"they say you have a chemical imbalance of serotonin and dopamine, but there's never been a study to prove that, ever.\"\nSimplistic \"chemical imbalance\" explanations for mental disorders have never received empirical support; and most prominent psychiatrists, neuroscientists, and psychologists have not espoused such ill-defined, facile etiological theories. However, this theory has been widely promoted by the press, advertising and professionals so that the majority of the general western public believes in it.\nThe documentary claims that psychiatrists have convinced the public that normal negative human experiences are mental illnesses. An example used in the movie is the assertion that psychiatrists seek to label typical shyness as a \"social anxiety disorder\"; however, patients are diagnosed with a social anxiety disorder only at debilitating levels, where there is an \"intense fear in social situations\". Unlike a shy individual, a person diagnosed with social anxiety disorder is likely to experience symptoms such as nausea, stammering, and panic attacks.\n\nSee also\nScientology and psychiatry\nControversy surrounding psychiatry\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\nCitizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR)\ncchrmuseum.org","180":"El Pueblo de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora la Reina de los \u00c1ngeles del R\u00edo de Porci\u00fancula (English: The town of Our Lady the Queen of the Angels of the River of the Porciuncula), shortened to Pueblo de los \u00c1ngeles, was the Spanish civilian pueblo settled in 1781, which became the American metropolis of Los Angeles. The pueblo was built using labor from the adjacent village of Yaanga and was totally dependent on local Indigenous labor for its survival.\nOfficial settlements in Alta California were of three types: presidio (military), mission (religious) and pueblo (civil). The Pueblo de los \u00c1ngeles was the second pueblo (town) created during the Spanish colonization of California (the first was San Jose, in 1777). El Pueblo de la Reina de los \u00c1ngeles\u2014'The Town of the Queen of Angels' was founded twelve years after the first presidio and mission, the Presidio of San Diego and the Mission San Diego de Alcal\u00e1 (1769). The original settlement consisted of forty-four people in eleven families, recruited mostly from Estado de Occidente. As new settlers arrived and soldiers retired to civilian life in Los Angeles, the town became the principal urban center of southern Alta California, whose social and economic life revolved around the raising of livestock on the expansive ranchos.\n\nFounding\nIn 1542 Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo, with a commission from Viceroy Antonio de Mendoza, was the first European to sail along and explore the California coast. Although he claimed all he saw as territory of the Spanish Empire, no efforts at colonization were made for over two hundred years. Concerned about colonizing efforts by the Russians and French, Spain set plans in motion in the 1760s to establish a presence and defend its claim to the territory.\nThe Spanish settlement did not reach Alta California until 1769, when explorer Gaspar de Portol\u00e0 reached the San Diego area via the first land route from Mexico. Accompanying him were two Franciscan Padres, Jun\u00edpero Serra and Juan Cresp\u00ed, who recorded the expedition. As they came through today's Elysian Park, they were awed by a river that flowed from the northwest, past their point and on southward. Cresp\u00ed named the river El R\u00edo de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora la Reina de los \u00c1ngeles de Porci\u00fancula, meaning, in Spanish, \"the River of Our Lady Queen of the Angels of Porciuncula\". The name derives from Santa Maria degli Angeli (Italian: \"St. Mary of the Angels\") which is the name of the small town in Italy housing the Porciuncula, the church where St. Francis of Assisi, founder of the Franciscan order, carried out his religious life. The river that was called the Porciuncula is today's Los Angeles River. Because the future town's name was a take on this \"Queen of Heaven\" Marian title, various versions of Cresp\u00ed's formula would be used for the town, including the exceedingly long El Pueblo de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora la Reina de los \u00c1ngeles sobre el R\u00edo Porci\u00fancula.\nDuring the expedition, Father Cresp\u00ed observed a location along the river that would be good for a settlement or mission. However, in 1771, Father Serra instead commissioned two missionaries to establish the Mission San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel-San Gabriel Mission near the present day Whittier Narrows section of the San Gabriel River. The missionaries encountered resistance from the Tongva to their attempts to resettle the Natives on the mission. The mission encountered further trouble in 1776 when a flood damaged the mission, convincing the missionaries to move and rebuild the mission on a higher and more defensible location: its present site in San Gabriel. The first Spanish governor of Las Californias, Felipe de Neve had, as well, recommended to Viceroy Bucareli Father Cresp\u00ed's location on the R\u00edo Porci\u00fancula (Los Angeles River) for a mission. Instead, in 1781, King Charles III mandated that a pueblo be built on the site instead, which would be the second town in Alta California, after San Jos\u00e9 de Guadalupe in 1777. The monarch, disregarding the production and trade roles of the missions, saw a greater need for secular pueblos to be established as the centers of agriculture and commerce to supply the crown's ever-growing military presence in \"Nueva California.\" The priests at the missions ignored the royal mandate and continued their ranching, trading and production of tallow, soap, hides, and beef, often in competition with new pueblo ventures.\n\nSettlement\nGovernor de Neve took his assignment seriously and had a complete set of maps and plans drawn up by May 1780 for the layout and settlement of the new pueblo, including the placement of government houses, town houses, the church, the fields, the farms, and access to the river \u2013 the Instrucci\u00f3n and the Reglamento para el gobierno de la Provincia de Californias. But gathering the pobladores-settlers was a little more difficult. After failing to recruit the target number of families in Sonora, he had to go as far as Sinaloa to finally end up with 11 families, that is, 11 men, 11 women, and 22 children of various Spanish American castes: Criollo, Mulatto and Negro.\n\nAs local lore tells it, on September 4, 1781 the 44 pobladores gathered at San Gabriel Mission and, escorted by a military detachment and two priests from the Mission, set out for the site that Cresp\u00ed had chosen. In reality, several of the families were probably already working on their plots of land as early as late July. Governor de Neve gave the new town the name El Pueblo de la Reina de los \u00c1ngeles-The Town of the Queen of the Angels. In accordance with the Laws of the Indies and Reglamento the new towns in Alta California were to have four square leagues of land; that is a distance marked by one league in each cardinal direction from the town center. The streets, however, were laid out at forty-five degrees from the cardinal directions, a plan which is still preserved in Downtown Los Angeles. The old town limits are still marked by Hoover and Indiana Streets in the west and east respectively.  In 1784 an asistencia or sub-mission of the San Gabriel Mission was established on the central plaza, to provide religious services to the settlers.\n\nGovernment\nThe pueblo came under the jurisdiction of the Commandancy General of the Internal Provinces in the Viceroyalty of New Spain. As a pueblo, Los Angeles was granted a cabildo (town council). The first municipal officers, the regidores (council members) and alcalde (municipal magistrate), were appointed by Governor de Neve. Subsequent ones were elected annually by the settlers, the vecinos pobladores. Since the government of Las Californias had a strong military orientation in this early phase of colonization, the civilian cabildo was originally supervised by a commisionado (commissioner) appointed by the comandante (commander) of the Presidio of Santa Barbara, who was charged with making sure the alcalde and regidores carried out their duties correctly. The first commisionado was Jos\u00e9 Vicente Feliz, one of the soldiers who accompanied the original 44 settlers to the pueblo. The first recorded alcalde was Jos\u00e9 Vanegas, who served in 1786 and 1796. Vanegas was first listed as an Indian in the original 1781 padr\u00f3n (register) but then as a Mestizo in the 1790 census. The next few alcaldes reflected the mixed population of the small settlement: Jos\u00e9 Sinova, a Criollo, 1789; Mariano de la Luz Verdugo, a Criollo, 1790; and Juan Francisco Reyes, a Mulatto, 1793. Among the first regidores were Felipe Santiago Garc\u00eda (a Criollo) and Manuel Camero (a Mulatto in the 1781 padr\u00f3n, and a Mestizo in 1790 census). In judicial affairs, both military and civil cases were appealed to the Audiencia of Guadalajara.\n\nLa Iglesia de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora la Reina de los \u00c1ngeles\nOn 18 August 1814 Father Luis G\u00edl y Taboada placed the cornerstone of a new Franciscan church amidst the ruins of the original asistencia. The completed structure was dedicated on 8 December 1822. A replacement chapel, named La Iglesia de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de los \u00c1ngeles (The Church of Our Lady of the Angels) was rebuilt utilizing materials of the original church in 1861. The term Reina (queen) was added later to reconcile the church's name with that of the town. The small chapel, also called \"La Placita\" and \"the Plaza Church,\" served the total Californio and immigrant  Roman Catholic community as the only church in the vicinity of the City of Los Angeles until the 1876 construction of the Cathedral of Saint Vibiana. Saint Vibiana Cathedral became the English-speaking parish and La Placita became the Spanish-speaking parish. \"The Plaza Church\" still stands today, exhibiting Spanish Colonial and Carpenter Gothic architectural styles.\nThe Los Angeles parish was under the Diocese of Sonora until 1840, when a new Diocese of the Two Californias was established to serve the Baja California Peninsula and Alta California. Both the dioceses of Sonora and the Two Californias were suffragan of the Archdiocese of Mexico.\n\nMexican independence and era\nAfter Mexico's War of Independence (1810\u20131821) from Spain, life began to change in Los Angeles and Alta California. With the secularization of the missions, their land was distributed for the establishment of many more ranchos. The Native population was displaced or absorbed into the Hispanic population.\nBeginning about 1827, Los Angeles, now the largest pueblo of the territory, became a rival of Monterey for the honor of being the capital of California; was the seat of conspiracies to overthrow the Mexican authority; and the stronghold of the South California party in the bickering and struggles that lasted down to the American occupation.\nIn about 1834, Richard Henry Dana Jr. visited San Pedro Harbor as a sailor. His book, Two Years Before the Mast, includes a brief depiction of the pueblo and area, then dependent on the export of cattle hides and tallow. In 1835 it was made a city by the Mexican Congress, and declared the capital, but the last provision was not enforced and was soon recalled. In 1836\u20131838, it was the headquarters of Carlos Antonio Carrillo, a legally named but never de facto governor of California, whose jurisdiction was never recognized in the north; and, in 1845\u20131847, it was the actual capital.\nIn 1842, a sheep rancher, pausing under an oak tree, discovered gold in Placerita Canyon in Rancho San Francisco, just north of the city  sparking a minor gold rush. In subsequent decades local mining employed hard rock and placer techniques. Land however turned out to be the more \"profitable gold\", as ranching and development expanded as the town and region grew.\n\nMexican\u2013American War\nManifest Destiny reached California at the time of the Mexican\u2013American War (1846\u20131848). On June 18, 1846 a small group of Yankees raised the California Bear Flag and declared independence from Mexico in the Bear Flag Revolt on the Plaza in Sonoma, Northern California. United States troops then took control of the presidios at Monterey and San Francisco, and proclaimed the invading \"conquest\" complete. In Southern California, the Mexican citizens repelled American troops for five months, utilizing about 160 vaqueros, or cowboys, against about 700 American forces.\n\nLos Angeles initially surrendered to the surprise invasion by United States forces. The small Mexican forces of Los Angeles fled at the approach of US troops, and August 13, 1846 the American flag was raised over the city. A garrison of fifty US Marines under Archibald Gillespie was left in control. The city's population had been rent by factional quarrels when war broke out between Mexico and the United States, but the occupation caused both factions to unite against the invading Americans.  Gillespie's garrison was compelled to withdraw in October when the residents, Californio Lancers, vaqueros on horseback without firearms, only lances,  revolted and chased the US occupying force back to the San Pedro Harbor. Los Angeles was not retaken until Commodore Stockton again captured the city on January 10, 1847, after the battles at the Siege of Los Angeles, Battle of Dominguez Rancho, Battle of San Pasqual, Battle of Rio San Gabriel and the Battle of La Mesa. These battles, in which the Californios were greatly outmanned and outgunned, represented the important overt resistance to the establishment of the American regime in the Los Angeles Basin. Lieutenant-Colonel Fr\u00e9mont and Governor of Alta California Andr\u00e9s Pico signed the Treaty of Cahuenga, an informal agreement to cease fighting in California at the Campo de Cahuenga in the San Fernando Valley in January 1847. Under the later comprehensive 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Mexico formally ceded nearly half its nation's total territory, including Alta California, to the United States.\n\nModern state park\nA 1920s restoration drive led by Christine Sterling began a restoration of the historic area, starting with Olvera Street. Today the Pueblo's original outline is preserved by the El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historic Monument. Among its saved and restored buildings is the oldest standing residence in Los Angeles City, the 1818 Avila Adobe built by Francisco Avila who owned Rancho Las Cienegas -\"mid Wilshire area\" and a successful cattle enterprise. Across Olvera Street stands the 1887 Eloisa Martinez de Sepulveda House, that now is the Los Angeles Plaza Historic District Visitors Center. The 1939 construction of the significant transit hub and architectural landmark, the Los Angeles Union Station east of the old Plaza, added to the Pueblo area's reinvigoration.\nOf archaeological interest is the discovery of sections of the original brick lined Zanja Madre-the Mother Ditch, which was a \"surface and underground\" gravity fed canal and aqueduct, that brought water from the Rio Porciuncula-Los Angeles River near the Arroyo Seco confluence, to the colonial pueblo and later the American city into the latter 19th century.\n\nSee also\nHistory of Los Angeles\nLos Angeles Plaza Historic District\nZanja Madre\nLaws of the Indies\nSpanish colonial pueblos and villas in North America\n\nNotes\nReferences\nThis article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Chisholm, Hugh, ed.

Its address is 9015 Sunset Boulevard.\nThe bottom level of the building is the restaurant, The Rainbow Bar and Grill. Upstairs was an exclusive club called \"Over the Rainbow\", which still consists of a full bar, a dance floor and a DJ booth. It currently has live entertainment on select days during the week. The restaurant is next to The Roxy Theatre and 1 OAK (formerly Gazzarri's); Billboard Live, and The Key Club.\n\nHistory\nBefore becoming the Rainbow, the restaurant was the Villa Nova restaurant, which was originally owned by film director Vincente Minnelli, at the time married to Judy Garland. Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe met at the restaurant on a blind date in 1952.\nAfter operating for 28 years, Villa Nova closed in 1968 and the building re-opened as the Windjammer until it closed in 1971.\nThe restaurant was founded in early 1972 by Gary Stromberg and Bob Gibson, heads of the PR firm Gibson & Stromberg. They brought in co-owners Elmer Valentine, Lou Adler, Mario Maglieri and others, opening in late March with a Buddah Records party for NRBQ.   On April 16, there was a party for Elton John. At the time, the word \"rainbow\" signified peace and freedom. It quickly became known as a hangout for celebrities of all types. John Belushi ate his last meal (lentil soup) at table No. 16. The pornography actor Ron Jeremy was also known to regularly hang out there in the 2000s and 2010s.\nFor many years, the owner was Mario Maglieri.\nThe Rainbow became known as a hangout for rock musicians and their groupies. Notable regulars at the Rainbow in this period include Keith Moon, Alice Cooper, Led Zeppelin, Ritchie Blackmore, Micky Dolenz, Harry Nilsson, John Lennon, Ringo Starr, and Neil Diamond. Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash were known to have occasionally visited the Rainbow. The group of musicians calling themselves the Hollywood Vampires made the Rainbow their home away from home in the mid-1970s. In the last two decades of his life, Mot\u00f6rhead frontman Lemmy was a daily fixture at the Rainbow whenever the band was not on tour, and often played a video poker machine at the end of the bar table.\nProducer Kim Fowley used to hang out at the Rainbow, especially in 1975, when he formed the all-girl group The Runaways. Actress and musician Cheryl Smith was given her pseudonym Rainbeaux Smith early in her career as a result of her frequenting the Rainbow; she briefly replaced Sandy West as drummer of The Runaways at the end of that band's existence.\nAs musical trends on the Strip changed towards heavy metal in the 1980s, the Rainbow followed suit. Members of M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, Poison, and Guns N' Roses frequented the bar. It was mentioned in a number of songs, such as \"Sunset and Babylon\" by W.A.S.P., \"Vampire\" by L.A. Guns and \"Peach Kelli Pop\" by Redd Kross, and featured in the videos of \"November Rain\", \"Estranged\" and \"Don't Cry\" by Guns N' Roses and also, although briefly, \"Rock Out\" and \"Stone Deaf in the U.S.A\" by Mot\u00f6rhead.\nAnthony Kiedis of the Red Hot Chili Peppers noted in his book Scar Tissue that he often sat with his father at the club along with members of bands such as Led Zeppelin and Kiss. Often the waitresses and bartenders were groupies as well as those who frequented the establishment. In Pamela Des Barres' book Let's Spend the Night Together, the author commented that as a barfly in the early 1980s she met a number of celebrities including Billy Idol.\nOn January 18, 2017, the Rainbow was inducted into the Hall of Heavy Metal History for introducing the world to new heavy metal acts.\nOn August 21, 2023, a lawsuit was filed by two women against the Rainbow Bar and Grill.

Rancho La Brea consisted of one square league of land of what is now Wilshire's Miracle Mile, Hollywood, and parts of West Hollywood. The grant included the famous La Brea Tar Pits.\n\nHistory\nThe title awarded by the alcalde in 1828 was confirmed by Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de Echeand\u00eda, governor of Alta California; in 1840, it was reconfirmed by Governor Juan Alvarado.\nWith the cession of California to the United States after the Mexican\u2013American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim was filed by Antonio Jos\u00e9 Rocha, Jos\u00e9 Jorge Rocha, and Josefa de la Merced de Jordan with the Public Land Commission in 1852, but it was rejected in 1860.  As a lawyer and surveyor, Henry Hancock worked for the Rocha family to aid them with their efforts to prove their claim to Rancho La Brea. The Rochas finally won their claim (the grant was recorded as patented to \"A. J. Rocha et al.\" in 1873). The grant included the famous La Brea Tar Pits.\nAs happened to other rancheros, the claimants' legal expenses left them broke. In 1860, Antonio Jos\u00e9 Rocha's son, Jos\u00e9 Jorge Rocha, deeded Rancho La Brea to Henry Hancock. Hancock paid $20,000 for the Mexican grants (at $2 or $3 per acre) with his profits from the sale of gold he had found in a rich placer mine. He engaged in the commercial development of the tar deposits on Rancho La Brea. He shipped considerable quantities to San Francisco by schooner.  After Hancock's death in 1883, it was owned by his wife, Ida Hancock Ross.  Most of Rancho La Brea was later subdivided and developed by his surviving son, Captain George Allan Hancock. He owned the Rancho La Brea Oil Company and donated 23 acres (93,000 m2) of Hancock Park to Los Angeles County in 1924 to preserve and exhibit the fossils exhumed from Rancho La Brea. The La Brea Tar Pits within the Park are a now registered National Natural Landmark.\nArthur Gilmore bought some of the Rancho land in the 1890s and started a dairy farm. Drilling for water, he struck oil. This find was named the Salt Lake Oil Field after the company that drilled for him. Arthur's son, Earl Gilmore, built Gilmore Stadium next to Gilmore Field.\n\nSee also\nRanchos of California\nList of Ranchos of California\nList of rancho land grants in Los Angeles County, California\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nMap of old Spanish and Mexican ranchos in Los Angeles County","183":"Reseda Boulevard, named Reseda Avenue until May 1929, is a major north\u2013south arterial road that runs through the western San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles, California.  \n\nReseda Boulevard runs approximately 12 miles (19 km) from the Santa Monica Mountains at the Marvin Braude Mulholland Gateway Park in the south to the Santa Susana Mountains and Porter Ranch in the north. It passes through the community of Tarzana, passes Mulholland Park gated community and El Caballero Country Club, then continues into the flats of the Valley through the communities of Reseda and Northridge, passes the campus of California State University Northridge, and ends at Porter Ranch. The epicenter of the 1994 Northridge earthquake was approximately one block west of the Boulevard, in its namesake community of Reseda. Damage occurred throughout the San Fernando Valley though areas of more widespread destruction followed along the boulevard's northern course, including an apartment building which stood at the time, the Northridge Meadows Apartments, where 16 people died when the top two floors collapsed on the ground-floor apartments.\n\nCommunities along Reseda Boulevard\n(Order is from south to north)\n\nTarzana \u2013 south of Victory Boulevard\nReseda \u2013 between Victory Boulevard and Roscoe Boulevard\nNorthridge \u2013 between Roscoe Boulevard and the Ronald Reagan Freeway (SR 118)\nPorter Ranch \u2013 north of SR 118\n\nTransportation\nMetro Local line 240 runs along Reseda Boulevard.

Reseda Boulevard now has the longest stretch of protected bike lanes in Southern California.\nIn 1977 the Los Angeles City Council failed to approve a plan to create a \"Reseda to the Sea\" link from the San Fernando Valley to L.A.'s Westside at Sunset Boulevard. Although no alternative plans were evaluated, the city continued to maintain an easement of the proposed alignment until at least 1991. This, along with an ongoing requirement that developers continue to dedicate and extend Reseda as far south as Mulholland Drive to improve fire safety, sparked criticism and protests by environmental and community activists.

Its northern end is slightly to the north of Santa Monica Boulevard at Keith Avenue in West Hollywood and its southern end is at Washington Boulevard in Culver City. Robertson Boulevard is accessible via exit #6 on the Santa Monica Freeway (Interstate 10).\n\nOverview\nThe northern part of the street in West Hollywood and Beverly Hills is a trendy tree-lined shopping district. In West Hollywood, the neighborhood surrounding Robertson Boulevard consists mostly of high-density apartment buildings and condominiums. The residential area surrounding the Robertson Boulevard shopping district in Beverly Hills is more family-oriented and is made up mostly of single-family residences.\nRobertson Boulevard has recently become a haven for celebrities and paparazzi. This is partially due to a large influx of unique boutiques and designer clothing & jewelry stores which are a mecca for many celebrity shoppers. In addition, several popular celebrity-infused eateries are located on Robertson Boulevard. The Kabbalah Centre is also located on the street.\n\nSouth of West Hollywood and Beverly Hills and north of Culver City, Pico-Robertson, Beverlywood and Crestview are upper-middle-class neighborhoods in West Los Angeles with a historical and substantial Jewish population.

It operates 304 locations and is the largest company of its kind in the United States. \nThe company oversees several subsidiaries, including Musician's Friend, AVDG, Music & Arts, Woodwind & Brasswind, and Giardinelli.\n\nHistory\nGuitar Center was founded in Hollywood in 1959 by Wayne Mitchell as The Organ Center, a retailer of electronic organs for home and church use. In 1964, after a supplier required him to carry Vox guitar amplifiers,  to continue receiving organs, Mitchell added the amplifiers to his inventory and renamed the store The Vox Center, leveraging the Beatles association with the Vox brand. In the late 1960s, as other brands like Marshall gained popularity, Mitchell renamed the store Guitar Center.\n\nBy 1972, Guitar Center had expanded to eight locations, including stores in San Francisco, San Diego and suburbs of Los Angeles. In the late 1970s, Ray Scherr, the General Manager of the San Francisco store, purchased the company from Wayne Mitchell. \nThe 1980s saw a resurgence in \"guitar rock,\" led by bands such as Van Halen Van Halen and an influx of Japanese-produced instruments. This period brought significant growth in guitar sales, prompting Guitar Center to expand nationwide, eventually becoming the largest musical instrument retailer in the United States.\n\nScherr sold the company in 1996. The following year, with 30 stores on the West Coast and in Michigan, Ohio, and Florida, Guitar Center made an initial public offering of stock and opened more new locations.\nIn 2000, Guitar Center acquired mail order and e-commerce retailer Musician's Friend for $50 million, and claimed the merged company was the world's largest seller of musical instruments. Musician's Friend became a wholly owned subsidiary, with its headquarters remaining in Medford, Oregon.\nIn 2005, Guitar Center Inc. acquired Music & Arts, the largest band and orchestra dealer in the United States, and merged it with their American Music Group chain of band and orchestral stores. The company was renamed Music & Arts. The same year, Guitar Center, Inc., started The Fender Music Foundation, a nonprofit organization that supported music education.\nIn 2006, Guitar Center acquired four stores in Texas from the South Texas and Central\/South American company, Hermes.  In the same year, Activision partnered with Guitar Center, and all purchases made during game play of Guitar Hero, beginning with the second installment, were made in a virtual Guitar Center store.\nIn February 2007, the Musician's Friend division acquired assets of the Indiana-based company Dennis Bamber, Inc., which included band and orchestra retailer Woodwind & Brasswind, plus Music 123 and Lyons Music.\nIn June 2007, Guitar Center agreed to a $1.9 billion buyout from Bain Capital, totaling $2.1 billion including debt. The deal was led by Goldman Sachs and amounted to a per-share price of $63, or a 26% premium on the June 26 closing price. The deal was approved by shareholders on September 18, 2007, and closed October 9, 2007.\nIn mid-2009, Guitar Center opened its first rehearsal and lessons studio facility in Woodland Hills, California, consisting of eight studios with backline, ranging in size from 350\u2013550 square feet (33\u201351 m2).\nIn 2011, Musician's Friend's headquarters operations were moved to Guitar Center's facilities in Westlake Village, California.  In the same year, Guitar Center began offering equipment rentals in one of their San Diego stores. Rental departments were extended to ten other locations, with plans to offer rentals across the country.\nIn May 2013, Standard & Poor's cut its debt rating on Bain Capital-owned Guitar Center Holdings Inc. to \"junk bond\" status, citing struggles with \"weak operating trends.\" The corporate credit rating on the company dropped from B to 'CCC+'.\nIn April 2014, Ares Management took a controlling stake in Guitar Center. Bain Capital, Guitar Center's former owner, retained partial ownership of the company, along with representation on the board. According to Mike Pratt, the retailer's previous chief executive, the deal would reduce Guitar Center's total debt and provide it with the resources to expand and invest in its business.\nIn August 2014, Guitar Center opened a new 28,000-square-foot flagship location in Times Square in New York City. The opening included a concert featuring The Roots. The Guitar Center Times Square location became the permanent home of Eric Clapton's Blackie Fender Stratocaster, which had been purchased at a Christie's Crossroads Centre auction in 2004 for $959,000. \nIn April, 2017, Moody's Investors Service revised the outlook on Guitar Center's B2 rating to negative. In the face of flat sales in the musical instrument industry as a whole, Guitar Center became overwhelmed by its $1 billion debt. \nGuitar Center filed for bankruptcy in 2020 and the Times Square location was closed. On November 13, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Guitar Center announced that it planned to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after negotiating a debt-cutting deal with key investors and lenders. Guitar Center said it had received up to $165 million in new equity, and lenders agreed to reduce its debt by around $800 million. The company emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy on December 23, 2020, after a reorganization deal added additional equity and debt capital.\n\nGuitar Center Legends Collection\nIn 2004, the Guitar Center began a \"Legends Collection\" with guitars made famous by Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and U2's the Edge. The Centre purchased Clapton\u2019s \u201cBlackie\u201d Fender Stratocaster for $959,500, his vintage Gibson \u201cES-335\u201d for  $847,500, and Vaughan\u2019s \u201cLenny\u201d Stratocaster for  $623,500, a total of over $2.4 million, in the Clapton Crossroads Centre charity auction at Christie's, New York. The Edge\u2019s cream white Gibson Les Paul Custom  was purchased for $240,000 at the Music Rising Charity Auction in 2007. The collection has been exhibited in a tour of musical events and Guitar Center locations, such as the one held at Madison Square Garden as part of Clapton\u2019s Crossroads Guitar Festival in April 2013. In August 2014, Clapton\u2019s Blackie and ES-335 were moved to a new permanent location in Times Square.\nClapton's cherry red Gibson 335 was used to record Cream\u2019s versions of \"Badge\" and \"Crossroads (from their final live performance in November 1968), and other historical performances over 40 years. Steve Ray Vaughan\u2019s \"Lenny\" was used to record his classic love songs, including \"Lenny\" and \"Riviera Paradise\".  The Edge's cream-colored 1975 Les Paul Custom, faded from its original white, had been used for U2's stage and studio performances. All the proceeds from the sale of these guitars went to Clapton\u2019s Crossroads Center charity.\nIn 2005, the Edge, producer Bob Ezrin, Gibson, and the Guitar Center Music Foundation (now known as the Fender Music Foundation) established Music Rising, a charity to benefit musicians whose lives had been disrupted by Hurricane Katrina. In 2007 The Edge donated his guitar to be auctioned for the charity and It was sold for $240,000 to Guitar Center ($288,000 including Buyer's Premium).\n\nGuitar Center's Drum-Off\nFrom 1988 through 2016, Guitar Center conducted an annual search for the next great undiscovered drummer. Developed to spotlight the drumming community, the Drum-Off was the music retailer\u2019s longest running artist-discovery program.\nThe process of Guitar Center\u2019s Drum-Off began with three rounds of preliminary competitions at each of Guitar Center's 250+ locations nationwide, with each contestant allowed five minutes of set up time and three minutes to perform. One winner from each store final competition advanced to one of 30 quarterfinal competitions, and one winner from each quarterfinal competition advanced to one of five semifinal competitions, during which contestants were allowed five minutes to perform. The winners from each of these five semifinal competitions qualified to compete in front of a live audience and a panel of celebrity judges at Guitar Center's Drum-Off finals in Los Angeles, California.\nIn the finals, each contestant was required to perform on a 5-piece acoustic drum kit complete with hardware, cymbals, cowbell, throne and the option to incorporate a Roland SPD-30 Octapad (the SPD-30 was not included in 2016). Contestants were evaluated by a panel of independent and credible judges on the following criteria: skills & technique, groove, originality, stage presence, and overall performance.\nGuitar Center discontinued their sponsorship of the annual contest in 2017.\n\nHollywood's RockWalk\nThe Sunset Boulevard location in Los Angeles hosts Hollywood's RockWalk, a hall of fame, honoring musical artists.

Rosecrans Avenue was originally named Drexel Avenue, and ran through the Rosecrans Rancho which is part of modern-day Gardena.\n\nRoute description\nRosecrans Avenue begins at the beach near El Porto in Manhattan Beach. On its route, it crosses through Manhattan Beach, El Segundo (northside of street only), Hawthorne, Lawndale, Gardena, Harbor Gateway, Willowbrook, Compton, East Rancho Dominguez, Paramount, Downey (for one block between Century Blvd and Lakewood Blvd\/SR-19), Bellflower, Norwalk, Santa Fe Springs, La Mirada, Buena Park (southside of street only; Fullerton and La Mirada connect on the northside near Beach Blvd\/SR-39), and Fullerton where the road ends at Euclid Street (eastern terminus).

Within the Burbank city limits it is signed as San Fernando Boulevard, and north of Newhall Pass it is signed as The Old Road. It was previously designated as Business Loop 5 in the 1970s.\n\nRoute\nSan Fernando Road starts at its intersection with Sierra Highway in the Sylmar neighborhood of Los Angeles. It passes through the city of San Fernando before re-entering the city of Los Angeles at the intersection with the Ronald Reagan Freeway (SR 118) in the neighborhood of Pacoima, where it parallels Interstate 5. Like Laurel Canyon Boulevard to the west in Sun Valley, it passes through rock quarries and the Hansen Dam Recreation Area, one of the last remaining open spaces in the San Fernando Valley.\nNorth of Sierra Highway, San Fernando Road becomes The Old Road. The Old Road runs parallel to Interstate 5 and serves the Stevenson Ranch, Valencia, and Castaic neighborhoods in the western Santa Clarita Valley. It only very briefly passes through the Santa Clarita city limits, as it is west of I-5 for nearly its entire length.\n\nThe portion between Sun Valley and the city of Burbank is mostly industrial, with heavy truck traffic through this area. San Fernando Road passes next to Bob Hope Airport and through downtown Burbank. Upon entering the Burbank city limits, it is signed as San Fernando Boulevard. At the intersection with Lincoln Street, there is an interruption in the route due to the reconstruction of the interchange with Interstate 5, with no direct link to the portion of San Fernando Boulevard that runs east of the freeway. At the intersection with Cypress Avenue in the Media City Center, there is another brief interruption in the route. 1st Street and Magnolia Boulevard connect both portions of San Fernando Boulevard.

North of Figueroa Street, San Fernando Road splits with Avenue 26, and passes under the Arroyo Seco Parkway at the mouth of the Arroyo Seco. San Fernando Road ends at the Pasadena Avenue intersection, where it becomes Avenue 20, which ends 5 blocks later at North Main Street, near Downtown Los Angeles.\n\nHistory\nPrior to the construction of Interstate 5, San Fernando Road was old U.S. Route 99 and U.S. Route 6. With the completion of the Golden State Freeway, it was re-signed as State Route 163 in the 1960s and Business Interstate 5 in the 1970s.\nToday, San Fernando Road is used as an alternative to Interstate 5 between Lincoln Heights and the Newhall Pass, due to the relatively few traffic signals on the route.\n\nLocal Transportation\nMetro Local lines 94, 224, 294 and 603 run along San Fernando Road, as well as Glendale Transit lines 7 and 12.\n\nOther uses\nThere was another San Fernando Road entirely within the city of Santa Clarita starting only 2+1\u20442 miles north of the northern end of the original San Fernando Road.

The address numbers continue to increase up to 6600 at Wilshire Boulevard. Here, the numbering switches from east-west numbers to north-south numbers with respect to the city grid. \nBetween Wilshire Boulevard and La Cienega Boulevard, the median of San Vicente forms a border between Beverly Hills and Los Angeles. The east side of the roadway is known as S. San Vicente Boulevard, with address numbers (even) decreasing from 700 at Wilshire to 400 at La Cienega. The west side is known as N. San Vicente Boulevard, with address numbers (odd) increasing from 100 at Wilshire to 300 at La Cienega. \nNorth of La Cienega, both sides of the street are in Los Angeles. The numbering continues accordingly as 400 S. San Vicente Boulevard. The street becomes N. San Vicente Boulevard at Gracie Allen Drive. As in the rest of Los Angeles, the numbers at the city's grid axis start with 100 (numbers 0-99 are not used). At Beverly Boulevard (300 N.), San Vicente enters the city of West Hollywood, where the street name and numbering do not change. The street terminates at Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood at 1100 N. San Vicente.\nA second San Vicente Boulevard runs between the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles and Santa Monica. This street is unrelated except in name.\n\nSan Vicente Park\nLocal neighborhood councils and non profit green activist have been pursuing making San Vicente Boulevard's median green space more accessible. Citing lack of civic green space. Planning meetings have taken place in the affected Olympic Park Neighborhood Council, Pico Neighborhood Council, and the Mid-City West Community Council. Money for the project is coming from these three councils and the Community Redevelopment Agency of Los Angeles (CRA\/LA). The Olympic Park Neighborhood Council is committing $30,000 for the project. In  2011, construction was to begin on the San Vicente median between Pico Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue sections center median. \"The plan called for the medians between Fairfax Avenue and Pico Boulevard to be adorned with new trees, a walking path and seating areas. Trees and plaques at the intersections at Pico Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue, identifying them as gateways, will also be installed.\" Recently, neighborhood councils and activist have pushed for the closure of all lanes and expanding the park along most of the planned K Line Northern Extension route from Pico Boulevard to the Beverly Center, A 3.2 miles linear park. Leaving only a locals utility lane for residents but a wider linear park for the city.\n\n\n== References ==","192":"Santa Monica Boulevard is a major west\u2013east thoroughfare in Los Angeles County, California, United States.

A portion of it is designated as California State Route 2, while the full avenue was Historic Route 66.\n\nRoute description\nThe western terminus of Santa Monica Boulevard is at Ocean Avenue near the Pacific Ocean.  From there until the San Diego Freeway (Interstate 405), Santa Monica Boulevard is a densely urban commercial street.  It assumes the designation California State Route 2 between Centinela Avenue at the Santa Monica\u2013Los Angeles border, and the Hollywood Freeway (U.S. Route 101). The portion between Centinela Avenue and Lincoln Boulevard in Santa Monica was also originally part of California State Route 2. From Centinela Avenue, Santa Monica Boulevard heads northeast through the wealthy areas of West Los Angeles, Westwood, Century City, and Beverly Hills before entering the decidedly urban West Hollywood.  Santa Monica Boulevard, being a major street, is for most of its length at least four lanes wide. Most of the Westside car dealerships are located on Santa Monica Boulevard. \nAfter Sepulveda Boulevard, Santa Monica Boulevard passes by Century City and its shopping center, and intersects with Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills. After intersecting with Wilshire in Beverly Hills, Santa Monica Boulevard continues northeast towards West Hollywood, spanning Beverly Boulevard and Melrose Avenue.

It was founded and dedicated by Paramahansa Yogananda, on August 20, 1950, and is owned by the Self-Realization Fellowship. The 10-acre (40,000 m2) site has lush gardens, a large spring-fed lake framed by natural hillsides, and a variety of flora and fauna, swans, ducks, koi, turtles, and lotus flowers. The property is a natural amphitheater. Thousands of visitors come each year.\n\nOverview\nThe visitor center provides information about Lake Shrine. There are waterfalls, fountains, flower beds, statues, white swans across the lake, lacy fern grottos, lily ponds, and a Dutch windmill which is used as a chapel. The Court of Religions, honoring five principal religions of the world, displays the symbols of these religions: a cross for Christianity, a Star of David for Judaism, a Wheel of Law for Buddhism, a crescent moon and star for Islam, and the Om symbol for Hinduism. Yogananda believed in an underlying harmony of all faiths that unites us all. Along with a few statues of Krishna and other Hindu deities, there is also a life-size statue of Jesus Christ, above the waterfall, as well as Francis of Assisi and the Madonna and Child.\n\nThe golden lotus archway, a towering, sleek, white arch trimmed with blue tile, and topped with gold lotus blossoms, is visible from all parts of the grounds. The archway frames the Mahatma Gandhi World Peace Memorial, an outdoor shrine where an authentic 1,000-year-old Chinese stone sarcophagus holds a portion of the ashes of Mahatma Gandhi.\nThe gardens are filled with little brick paths and short stairways which lead from the main trail to hidden alcoves where meditation or sitting and taking in the view is possible. The gift shop features arts and crafts from India which is adjacent to a museum focusing on Paramahansa Yogananda, the founder of Lake Shrine. There is a Dutch windmill converted into a chapel, a houseboat, a bookstore and a temple overlooking the lake.\n\nHistory\nThe site of the present day Lake Shrine was once part of a 460-acre (1.9 km2) parcel of land in the Santa Ynez Canyon, called Bison Ranch. After an initial daily lease arrangement, it was purchased by the silent film producer and director Thomas H. Ince in 1912 to serve as his studio that was developed into an expansive network of sets. Originally known as the Miller 101 Bison Ranch studio, it was subsequently named Inceville, and then Triangle Ranch. After Ince founded his new Triangle\/Ince Studios in Culver City in 1915, the site was taken over the following year by director William S. Hart and eventually renamed Hartville. On January 16, 1916, a fire broke out at the Inceville studio; portentously, the first of numerous that eventually claimed all of the timber frame buildings onsite. In 1920, Hart sold the property to the Robertson-Cole Pictures Corporation when it was renamed as R.C. Ranch, and where filming continued until a blaze destroyed all of the remaining structures (except for an old church that was made of stone) on July 4, 1922.\n\nFor a period of time hence, the property was used as a sand, rock, and gravel quarry before it was later purchased by Los Angeles real-estate magnate Alphonzo Bell Sr. In 1927, the surrounding hillsides were hydraulically graded to fill the canyon, with the intention to completely level it for future development. However, the earth-moving project was never completed, which left a large basin in an unleveled portion of the canyon that subsequently filled to a depth of 20 ft (6.1 m) with water from four (hot and cold) springs within the vicinity. The 2.5-acre water body (10,000 m2) became known as Lake Santa Ynez; the only natural spring-fed lake within the City of Los Angeles.\nThe property remained undeveloped for more than a decade, when the lake was used as a local swimming hole and cattails and reeds grew to screen most of it from view. Although much of the local citizenry considered the area to be valueless swampland, the property was nevertheless purchased by H. Everett \"Big Mac\" McElroy (the assistant superintendent of construction at 20th Century Studio) in 1940, when it was again used as a film set. McElroy later reflected on his initial vision of his purchase:\n\n\"There is no doubt that we were labeled as crazy. But looking up at the bowl surrounding my mudhole, I could see terraces of trees - all kinds of trees, maybe five-hundred tropical and otherwise. I could see banks of flowers and shrubs and a path meandering around the lake, with cutaways into the bank for tree ferns and hanging baskets of fuchsias and begonias and mossy green rock plants. I was itching to build rockeries and put in rustic wooden bridges and a giant waterwheel that would act in conjunction with a pump as irrigation through a pipe-laid water system over the entire project.\"\nThe lake was subsequently dredged, and the weeds were cleared away. During his ownership, McElroy and his wife lived in three successively originative domiciles: their two-story Mississippi-styled houseboat (Adeline) transported from Lake Mead, a mill house McElroy constructed (which today serves as the gift shop and museum) equipped with a 2.5 ton 15 ft (4.6 m) water wheel used for onsite irrigation from captured lake overflow, and a sixteenth-century replica of a Dutch windmill he built, which later served as the first chapel of the Lake Shrine. The windmill, though functional, was never used. After the McElroys had moved into the mill house, they rented out the houseboat to film stars, movie-industry people, and on occasion to unnamed royalty. At some point, a Chinese Junk had been brought to the site and moored on the eastern shore.\n\nIn 1948, McElroy and his wife sold the property to Rene Williams and Joseph M. Gross (an oil company executive) for a reported price exceeding $250,000. Gross and his wife moved into the windmill and made plans to redevelop the site into a resort that included a rambling $2.3 million, 150-room hotel to be constructed around the contour of Lake Santa Ynez. However, one evening Mr. Gross purportedly had a dream reoccur three times, where in the middle of the lake there was a platform adorned with a podium. Here ministers from the \"churches of all religions\" addressed thousands of attendees with inspirational speeches. When Mr. Gross awoke, he looked up the name \"Church of All Religions\" in the telephone directory and found the listing for the Self-Realization Fellowship Church of All Religions located in Hollywood. Inspired by this extraordinary coincidence, Gross immediately composed a letter to go out in the next day's mail, which described his dream and included an offer to sell his property.\nRather than await a response, on the following day, Gross telephoned the church headquarters and was transferred to Paramahansa Yogananda who mysteriously initiated the conversation before the caller could even introduce himself or state his business: \"You have some property for sale, don't you? When can I see it?\", inquired Sri Yogananda. \"But you haven't received my letter,\" replied Mr. Gross. \"The letter will come tomorrow morning. Can we meet tomorrow afternoon?\", responded Sri Yogananda. The next day, he visited the site and immediately planned for the establishment of an open-air shrine of all religions. With the support of several benefactors, Paramahansa Yogananda acquired the property in 1949 and constructed a temple, meditation garden, and the Mahatma Gandhi peace memorial.\n\nDuring the months of improvement, Sri Yogananda commuted from the Mount Washington hermitage (whilst spending at least several nights in the houseboat) to supervise the project with a vision to create an environment that would reflect all aspects of God with peace, beauty, and harmony; and also invoked a blessing upon all of the future visitors to the Lake Shrine. A public dedication of the Lake Shrine took place on August 20, 1950. The keynote speaker was the then Lieutenant Governor Goodwin Knight who addressed some 1,500 attendees, including Oscar Gavrilovich (Council General of Yugoslavia in New York) and a number of other foreign dignitaries. Within the first eight months of its opening, ten thousand people had visited the site.\nSri Yogananda had remarked that the location reminded him of Kashmir, and had described within the Autobiography of a Yogi some of the landscaped features and flora cultivated onsite:\n\n\"Guadalupe palms and Chinese rice-paper trees adorn the lake shores and other parts of the grounds, as well as mango, papaya, guava, cherimoya, fig, pepino, banana, and rose-apple trees. Much of the landscaping, the rockwork, and the plantings of trees, shrubs, and flowers are the loving handiwork of SRF residential disciples. Pilgrims to the SRF Lake Shrine walk over small bridges, under archways of tropical trees, and through paths bordered by exquisite exotic flowers. . . A quaint three-story brick structure on the grounds is a replica of a Dutch windmill house. Its courtyard garden is the site of an SRF Cafe. A fragrant area of ginger plants, bamboos, and cacti leads to a sumac-shaded meditation-seat, a natural formation of coral stone from the Salton Sea.\"\nOn March 6, 1952, the day before his passing, Paramahansa Yogananda and a group of monks participated in what was to become known as the Guru's \"Last Supper\", where for over an hour Sri Yogananda chanted \"Light the Lamp of Thy Love\" while playing the organ.\nA number of improvements have occurred on the property in the ensuing years, including: the construction of the main temple upon the southern bluff overlooking the lake (in 1996), construction of the monastics' ashram and retreat (1997), the purchase of the adjoining Santa Ynez Transcendental Meditation (TM) property (1998), the addition of a steel structure and copper roof over the Gandhi peace memorial (2002), the renovation of the Lake Shrine Court of Religions, entrance gate (2003), and the houseboat (2007); and the restoration of the Windmill Chapel (2015).\n\nFeatures\nGandhi Shrine\nThe Lake Shrine is home for the Mahatma Gandhi World Peace Memorial. Originally designed by Paramahansa Yogananda as a \"wall-less temple\", it was erected in honor of Mahatma Gandhi, the architect of India's freedom through nonviolent means. Along the southern lakeshore, surrounding a semicircular portion of the memorial area stands the golden lotus archway, which is crowned at the center with a massive ellipsoidal pinnacle that is flanked by two large lotuses (with two additional smaller ellipsoidal fixtures on the outermost edges atop the structure); each constructed of copper coated with a golden varnish. The focal point of the memorial is a thousand-year-old stone sarcophagus from China, in which a portion of Gandhi's ashes are encased in a brass and silver coffer. The sarcophagus is flanked by two statues of Guanyin.\nThe ashes had been sent to Yogananda by an old friend, Dr. V.M. Nawle, a publisher and journalist from Pune, India. Following the dedication of the memorial, Dr. Nawle wrote:\n\nRegarding Gandhi ashes, I may say that they are scattered and thrown in almost all the important rivers and seas, and nothing is given outside India except the remains which I have sent to you after a great ordeal ... You are the only one in the whole world who received Gandhi ashes outside India.\nFor some, enshrining Gandhi's ashes at the Lake Shrine is controversial since the Hindu cremation ritual ends with immersion of the ashes in water. One report states that Gandhi's relatives want the ashes at Lake Shrine to be immersed in water. Another report states that the descendants of Mahatma Gandhi do not want to have the ashes removed because it would entail breaking the shrines.\n\nWindmill Chapel\nThe previous owners, the McElroys, built an authentic reproduction of a 16th-century Dutch windmill. Though the mill was never put to use, its sails are functional and capable of turning in the wind. Then came a boat dock and landing, whose peaked roof, carved figure-heads, and benches added yet another charming touch to the unusual setting. Yogananda converted the windmill into a chapel where meditations and services were held. Until the new temple was constructed in 1996, the windmill chapel was the primary location for all services held at the Lake Shrine. During the interim years, it had been enlarged once during the 1950s, and again later to accommodate the ever increasing attendance.\nDue to the erosion caused by the elements, termites, and the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the chapel was closed to the public in 2013. Cost overruns delayed the completion of the Windmill Chapel for another year. During an exploratory demolition process, it was discovered that the windmill tower was not well-connected to the lower structure, making it unreliable for withstanding earthquakes. The scope of the restoration work therefore evolved into a major engineering project. Throughout the nearly two year-long restoration process, both the interior and exterior appearance of the building were diligently preserved to match its original form. Along with the architects, engineers, and other professional tradespeople, SRF monks with carpentry skills and construction experience participated in the project, which was entirely funded through donations from devotees.\nTo remedy the structural deficiency, two 18 ft (5.5 m) long steel beams were installed to anchor the octagonal tower to the masonry of the outer walls, thus dispersing the load upon the lower structure. About six years prior to the windmill restoration project, SRF staff had purchased some rare old growth redwood beams that were salvaged in Mendocino County. This wood was used to build the 20 ft (6.1 m) long windmill replacement veins, the fascia, and other exterior elements. Due to the high presence of tannin that built up within the wood over the course of some four-hundred years, it is considered to be highly resilient to weathering and termite incursion, and is estimated to last in the hundreds of years.\nFurther improvements included: the replacement or repair of all of the roofs; installation of additional hidden steel structural reinforcement to help prevent earthquake damage; and the precise re-creation of the original windmill sails, window casings, the skylight, and other elements of the building's extensive customized woodwork. The tiles covering the windmill tower were removed, numbered, and reinstalled in their original order after repairs were made to its frame. Additional upgrades were made to the furnace, gas lines, the access for the disabled, retaining walls, the surrounding landscaping; and the electrical, security, audio, and fire alarm systems. The reopening of the chapel took place on July 27, 2015, with a ribbon-cutting ceremony officiated by Brother Achalananda, preceded by an introduction by Brother Vishwananda.\n\nLake, waterfalls and animal life\nAveraging a depth of 15 feet (4.6 m), Lake Santa Ynez is fed by two waterfalls; one that falls approximately 25 feet (7.6 m), and another series-waterfall, that falls approximately 10 feet (3.0 m).\nYogananda (Paramahansa means supreme or highest swan) encouraged swans to live on the Lake Shrine. Their large nests can be seen in this locale. Brother Anandamoy said in the recording, Is Peace Possible in Today's World that when he was a minister at the Lake Shrine, they had three pairs of swans: one white, one black, and one white with a black neck. The lake was big enough for everybody, but the swans fought, fighting for the kill. They had to be separated, by dividing the lake into three sections. Anandamoy continues saying that swans are like people and as long as one party wants the \"whole cake\" there will be war. If people follow the laws of God, overcome selfishness and consider the welfare of everyone, we will have peace eventually.\n\nIn popular culture\nElvis Presley loved the shrine. According to his friend, Jerry Schilling, he walked around the lake and picked up some brochures, and later sent away for information about Eastern philosophy. Elvis developed a 12-year relationship with Sri Daya Mata, the woman who was then the president of the Self-Realization Fellowship, and would often call her for advice when he was troubled.\n\nGeorge Harrison's funeral was held at the Lake Shrine. Anne-Marie O'Connor of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \"After the death of George Harrison, one of the most high-profile members of the Self-Realization Fellowship, his family and friends gathered at the Lake Shrine's small Windmill Chapel for his funeral. Ravi Shankar was there with his wife.\"\nSinger-songwriter Judee Sill (1944\u20131979) was given a service here by her friends in 1979 following her death from an overdose in November 1979. Her ashes were then scattered on the Pacific Ocean.\nThe memorial service for Lux Interior, lead singer of the Cramps, was held on February 21, 2009, at the Windmill Chapel.\nDennis Weaver was a member of the Self-Realization Fellowship and spoke once a month at the Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine for seventeen years, while Gerry, his wife, played the organ. He said, \"We called it our 'mom and pop' church and it was one of my great blessings. It was life-changing.\"\nThe actress Linda Evans was invited by Dennis Weaver, when she was doing a guest appearance on McCloud, to the SRF Lake Shrine, to hear one of his monthly Sunday sermons. Weaver gave her the Autobiography of a Yogi, saying that it changed his life. Linda wrote, \"Because of Dennis I took the first step in what would become a lifelong spiritual journey. After years studying the Self-Realization Fellowship at Malibu, I went on to learn from books and other teachers\".\nTom Petty's memorial was held at the Lake Shrine in October 2017.\nJazz singer and actor Herb Jeffries's memorial service was held at the Lake Shrine on July 12, 2014. Paramahansa Yogananda was Jeffries' guru. Jeffries was internationally known for performing with Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, and Earl \"Fatha\" Hines. He was also recognized as \"The Bronze Buckaroo\", the first African-American to take a lead role in westerns.\n\nSee also\nEncinitas Gardens of Self Realization Fellowship Hermitage\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nSelf-Realization Fellowship's information on the Lake Shrine\nVideo","194":"Sawtelle Boulevard is a north\/south street in the Westside region of the city of Los Angeles, California.

The street parallels Interstate 405 for much of its route. Portions of Sepulveda Boulevard between Manhattan Beach and Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) are designated as part of State Route 1 (SR 1).\nSince 2018, there have actually been four distinct segments in Los Angeles County signed as Sepulveda Boulevard. The southernmost of the four segments is an east-west route located in the South Bay, and continues west as Camino Real in Torrance and east as Willow Street in Long Beach. The second segment runs from Manhattan Beach north to the southern border of El Segundo. The third segment runs from LAX, through the Westside regions, and over the Santa Monica Mountains at the Sepulveda Pass into the San Fernando Valley. The northernmost section of Sepulveda Boulevard is in Sylmar, running from Roxford Street north to San Fernando Road.\nAt one point, Sepulveda Boulevard was the longest street in the city and county of Los Angeles, with the Los Angeles Times reporting in 2006 that it was around 42.8 miles (68.9 km) in length. The City of El Segundo has since renamed their portion of SR 1 Pacific Coast Highway.\n\nHistory\nIn 1769, the Spanish Portola expedition, the first Europeans to see inland areas of California, traveled north through Sepulveda pass on August 5. The party had been travelling west, intending to reach and follow the coast, but were discouraged by the steep coastal cliffs beginning at today's Pacific Palisades and decided to detour inland. They found the pass through the Santa Monica Mountains and followed it into the San Fernando Valley. The pass had originally been a faint footpath used by the native Tongva people.\nSepulveda Boulevard was named in 1925 after 18th century cattle rancher Francisco Xavier de Sep\u00falveda, whose ranch, Rancho San Vicente y Santa Monica, extended from the route to the Pacific Ocean. \n\n \nBetween the City of Hermosa Beach and Lincoln Boulevard, the road was once signed as U.S. Route 101 Alternate until being replaced by State Route 1, and between Lincoln Boulevard and San Fernando Road (formerly US 99), the road was once signed as State Route 7 until being replaced by Interstate 405. \nThe part of the route that runs through the San Fernando Valley was a major hub of prostitution. The entertainment industry has also referenced the street. The 1931 comedy film Everything's Rosie has a chase scene that goes through the newly built Sepulveda Boulevard tunnel. In 1946, the Jay Livingston and Ray Evans composing duo wrote the song Sepulveda in tribute to the street; the song would be recorded by Alvino Rey and his Orchestra with Joanne Ryan for Capitol Records, as would The King's Jesters for Vogue Records. Sepulveda Boulevard, along with Pico Boulevard, is mentioned in the title and lyrics of a novelty song Pico and Sepulveda composed by Eddie Maxwell (Eddie Cherkose) and Jule Styne; this song was recorded by Freddy Martin and his Orchestra in 1947 for release as a single.\n\nName changes\nPortions of Sepulveda Boulevard have had the name changed, especially most of those segments that were designated by state officials as part of State Route 1. Hermosa Beach historian John Hales said that the city formally adopted the name of Pacific Coast Highway in 1947 to possibly end a dispute to whether to name the route Sepulveda or Camino Real. In 2018, the city of El Segundo also decided to formally change the name to Pacific Coast Highway to better appeal to visitors as being a coastal community.\n\nRoute description\nSince 2018, there are four distinct segments in Los Angeles County signed as Sepulveda Boulevard. All four once connected to each other. The three north-south segments were once a continuous route but were separated by local renaming and freeway construction. There is no current evidence that the southernmost east-west route was once continuous with the north-south segments. \nThe southernmost segment is an east-west route located in the South Bay area that continues east as Willow Street near SR 103 in Long Beach, and west as Camino Real before Torrance Boulevard in Torrance. It crosses the Harbor Freeway (I-110) in West Carson.\nSepulveda Boulevard then resumes at Artesia Boulevard in Manhattan Beach as a continuation of SR 1. In 2018, the city of El Segundo renamed their portion of SR 1 to Pacific Coast Highway from Rosecrans Avenue to Imperial Highway where SR 1 continues again as Sepulveda Boulevard. Past Imperial Highway, it crosses the western terminus of the Century Freeway (I-105), going through the LAX Airport Tunnel to pass under its runways. The road then passes through an interchange with Century Boulevard, which provides access to LAX's terminals to the west and the San Diego Freeway (I-405) to the east.\nAt the north end of LAX, SR 1 branches to the west as Lincoln Boulevard while Sepulveda Boulevard continues north to become a primary thoroughfare through the Westside region cities and communities of Westchester, Culver City, West Los Angeles, and Westwood. In Culver City, north of Slauson Avenue, it merges for a few blocks with Jefferson Boulevard. From Jefferson, Sepulveda Boulevard runs parallel to I-405 as it goes through West Los Angeles and Westwood, passing the Los Angeles National Cemetery.\nAfter going past Bel Air, it parallels the freeway up the Sepulveda Canyon. At the Skirball Cultural Center, Sepulveda Boulevard then curves west away from I-405, passes through a tunnel under Mulholland Drive, and then follows a serpentine route down the north side of the Sepulveda Pass. It then passes under I-405 just before crossing Ventura Boulevard in Sherman Oaks. Sepulveda Boulevard then runs parallel to the east of I-405, crossing the Ventura Freeway (US 101) and the Los Angeles Metro G Line rapid transit route, and through the San Fernando Valley communities of Van Nuys and North Hills, to its northern terminus at the Rinaldi Street interchange with I-405 in Mission Hills.\nThe northernmost section of Sepulveda Boulevard in Sylmar, running from Roxford Street to San Fernando Road, is primarily a frontage road along the Golden State Freeway (I-5). Prior to the construction of the 405 freeway in the 1960s, that disjunct piece and the main section of Sepulveda Boulevard were one continuous street, separated when the 405 freeway interchange with the Golden State Freeway was built atop the section between Rinaldi and Roxford Streets and referred to as the \"boulevard of death\" due to having over 30 deaths in 11 years at this now demolished segment.\n\nPublic transportation\nPublic transit along Sepulveda Boulevard is provided by several bus lines. The north-south part provides bus service in the San Fernando Valley by Metro Local line 234, through the Sepulveda Pass by Metro Rapid line 761, through West Los Angeles, Culver City and LAX by Culver City Transit Line 6 and Rapid 6, and from LAX onwards by Metro Local line 232. The west-east portion of Sepulveda Boulevard provides bus service by Torrance Transit line 7.

El Camino Sierra refers to the full length of a trail formed in the 19th century, rebuilt as highways in the early 20th century, that ran from Los Angeles to Lake Tahoe following parts of modern State Route 14, U.S. Route 395 and State Route 89. Two portions of this road are currently signed as Sierra Highway. The first is an old alignment of SR 14\/U.S. Route 6 from Los Angeles to Mojave. This road is also signed with the unusual designation of State Route 14U through the city of Santa Clarita. The second part signed as Sierra Highway is a portion of US 395 in Bishop.\nTraversing the extremes of California, from the Mojave Desert to the Sierra Nevada, El Camino Sierra has been advertised to the world as a highway to showcase the natural beauty of California as far back as 1910. Though most of Sierra Highway was bypassed in the early 1970s with freeways, the road is still well known. The portion through the San Gabriel Mountains is noted as the primary filming location for the film Duel.\n\nRoute description\nEl Camino Sierra connects Los Angeles with Lake Tahoe along the eastern edge of California, serving the counties of Los Angeles, Kern, Inyo, Mono, Alpine and El Dorado. The highway exists as a roadway now called Sierra Highway from Los Angeles to Mojave. North of Mojave, El Camino Sierra is better known by the numbered designations in current use. While traversing the state, the highway crosses several mountain passes. The highway crests the San Gabriel Mountains via Soledad Pass. While in the Sierra Nevada the highway crosses Sherwin Summit, Deadman Summit, Conway Summit, Devil's Gate Pass, Monitor Pass and Luther Pass.\n\nSouthern California\nSierra Highway begins at Tunnel Station within the northernmost limits of the City of Los Angeles, where it intersects with San Fernando Road. This junction was historically the intersection of U.S. Route 99 and U.S. Route 6. It is located adjacent to the intersection of the replacement freeways, the Newhall Pass interchange of Interstate 5 and State Route 14.\nThe highway serves as one of the main thoroughfares of Santa Clarita. Through the city, Route 14 was moved to a freeway alignment in 1971; however, the process to decommission the old alignment of Route 14 is not complete. As a result, this portion is signed California State Route 14U, the U signifying \"un-relinquished\". Formal specifications for Route 14U are not published on Caltrans logs, but the route's existence is acknowledged in Caltrans' bridge inventory logs. According to the City of Santa Clarita, Caltrans maintains Sierra Highway (14U) from 500 feet north of Newhall Avenue to Whispering Leaves Drive. The remaining part of Sierra Highway through the City of Santa Clarita is maintained by the city and not part of the 14U designation. In 2018 Caltrans funded a new pedestrian overpass as one item on a list of requested improvements by the city before they accept relinquishment of the road from the state.\n\nSierra Highway, modern  Route 14, and a main line of the Union Pacific Railroad all cross the San Gabriel Mountains, cresting the mountains at Soledad Pass (elevation 3,179 feet (969 m)). The three transportation arteries use different paths up the mountains, separating at Santa Clarita and converging near Acton. Sierra Highway uses Mint Canyon, the railroad uses Soledad Canyon and the modern Route 14 is a hybrid route using the ridges and side canyons between the two older routes. These canyons are formed by the Santa Clara River and its tributaries.\nUpon exiting the mountains, Sierra Highway enters the Antelope Valley and serves as one of the main streets of Palmdale, Lancaster, and Rosamond. The highway runs parallel to the modern Route 14 and the railroad, becoming a frontage road. Just shy of Mojave the freeway portion of Route 14 ends, while the frontage road becomes a dirt path and eventually terminates. From this point, the canonical route of Sierra Highway joins State Route 14, passing through downtown Mojave.\n\nU.S. Route 395 and State Route 89\nNorth of Mojave the alignments of State Routes 14 and 89, and U.S. Route 395 have not significantly changed since first paved, and are called El Camino Sierra. Significant portions have been upgraded to a divided highway; however, most of the upgrades used the same alignment as the old two lane road. The highway cuts across Red Rock Canyon State Park to follow a series of valleys along the crest of the Sierra Nevada. While traversing the Owens Valley, the Sierra Highway passes Mount Whitney, the highest point in the contiguous United States, 10,000 feet (3,000 m) above the highway. As of 2009, the only other signed section of Sierra Highway is a portion of  U.S. 395 past the separation with U.S. 6 in Bishop.\nU.S. 395 was rebuilt on a new alignment on the ascent to Sherwin Summit and around Crowley Lake. Unlike the highway relocation in southern California, the old alignments have been renamed, now called Lower Rock Creek Road, Old Sherwin Grade, and Crowley Creek Road; not Sierra Highway. From here to Lake Tahoe, the highway crosses mountainous terrain inside the Sierra Nevada, giving the highway its name. While in the Sierra Nevada, the road passes by attractions such as Mammoth Mountain, Yosemite National Park and Mono Lake. El Camino Sierra separates from U.S. 395, just prior to the Nevada state line at Topaz Lake, following SR 89. This is the only portion of the route not used year-round, as Caltrans closes Route 89 over Monitor Pass during winter months. Motorists destined for Lake Tahoe during the winter closures can continue along US 395 into Nevada, and return to California via Nevada State Route 88 or Nevada State Route 207.\n\nHistory\nEl Camino Sierra\nThe first recorded journey along what would become El Camino Sierra was by Jedediah Smith in 1826. The trail was in common use by prospectors passing through the area because of the California Gold Rush and Comstock Lode. While still mostly a dirt road, several people began promoting El Camino Sierra as a scenic route. In 1910, the Los Angeles Times announced that Governor Gillet had announced funding to construct a new road to connect El Camino Real with Yosemite National Park. When finished, a new \"wonderful circuit\" route would be complete and El Camino Sierra would become \"one of the most beautiful scenic routes in the world.\" In 1912, the Southern Pacific Railroad published an article called \"Two Mules and a Motorist\" in which the author's trip down El Camino Sierra was detailed, promoting the trail as a scenic side trip, via pack mules, from its rail lines. In 1915, the California Teachers Association distributed a promotional book to the annual convention of the National Education Association. This book contained an article that sung the praises of this \"soon-to-be-world-famous highway\" called El Camino Sierra. While noting that it was still mostly an unimproved trail, the article assured the readers that county and state officials were working frantically to upgrade the route and, with the aid of convict labor, this would soon be a \"boulevard the entire distance from Los Angeles to Lake Tahoe.\" The article concluded by stating El Camino Sierra was \"a highway with a hundred by-ways, each by-way with a hundred wonders\". The article also implored the state legislature to extend El Camino Sierra to Truckee, Quincy and Susanville using a route similar to modern State Route 89, SR 70 returning to US 395.\nBy 1918, El Camino Sierra had been included in the Blue Book, an early road atlas of the United States. The Los Angeles Times declared El Camino Sierra complete on February 19, 1931, announcing that the portion from Mojave to Owens Valley was now paved, and would be dedicated the following Sunday.\n\nSierra Highway\nDuring the 1930s, two U.S. highways, both formed in 1926, were extended into California using El Camino Sierra. The southern terminus of U.S. 395 was extended from Spokane, Washington to San Diego, using El Camino Sierra from near what is now Topaz Lake to Inyokern, by 1935. By 1937, U.S. Route 6 was extended from Colorado, mostly along the Midland Trail, to Long Beach using El Camino Sierra south of Bishop. As part of the 1964 state highway renumbering US 6 was truncated at Bishop, and the route from the separation with US 395 to I-5 was renumbered SR 14.\nThough during the 1970s most of Sierra Highway was bypassed by freeways and expressways, the old two-lane road remained a famous roadway. In 1971, Steven Spielberg made his first feature-length film, Duel, along Sierra Highway, near Acton. The film is about an unseen truck driver who stalks and attempts to kill an innocent motorist trapped in the truck's game. It prominently shows the desert portions of Sierra Highway. With Duel's status, both restorations of the truck used in the movie, as well as replicas exist. The owner of one such truck has driven it along Sierra Highway for nostalgia, enjoying the terrified looks received from passing motorists who recognize it. Other movies have since been filmed in the vicinity, including scenes in The Terminator.\n\nMajor intersections\nSee also\nCalifornia Roads portal\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nFloodgap Roadgap by Cameron Kaiser\nCamino Sierra by Lloyd L.

At one time Slauson Avenue was a center for urban heavy industry in Los Angeles; the ATSF Harbor Subdivision once ran along Slauson Avenue. It is also known for the  Simply Wholesome Vegetarian restaurant and Health food store, as well as the historic Jet Inn motor hotel.\n\nRevitalization Project\nPortions of Slauson Avenue have been revitalized with a new tree-lined barrier, new LED street and traffic lights and metro local bus benches. The project was officially completed in May 2017.\n\nIn popular culture\nNipsey Hussle\nRapper Ermias Asghedom (1985\u20132019), professionally known as Nipsey Hussle, was from Los Angeles. He frequently referred to Crenshaw and Slauson Avenue in his music, and was nicknamed Neighborhood Nip for that reason. He owned the Marathon Clothing Store on the intersection. The intersection was named Ermias \u201cNipsey Hussle\u201d Asghedom Square in April 2019 to honor him.\n\nDr. Dre\nThe music video for Dr. Dre's 1993 song \"Let Me Ride\" was shot on location on Slauson Avenue.

In 1907, the Los Angeles Water Department built the Silver Lake Reservoir, named for LA Water Commissioner Herman Silver, giving the neighborhood its name. The area is now known for its architecturally significant homes, independently owned businesses, diverse restaurants, painted staircases, and creative environment.\n\nGeography and climate\nSilver Lake is flanked on the northeast by Atwater Village and Elysian Valley, on the southeast by Echo Park, on the southwest by Westlake, on the west by East Hollywood and on the northwest by Los Feliz.\nStreet and other boundaries are: the Los Angeles River between Glendale Boulevard and Fletcher Drive and Riverside Drive on the northeast, the Glendale Freeway on the east, Effie Street, Coronado Street, Berkeley Avenue and Fletcher Drive on the southeast, the Hollywood Freeway on the south, Virgil Avenue on the west and Fountain Avenue and Hyperion Avenue on the northwest.\nThe prime real estate around the Silver Lake Reservoir is known as Moreno Highlands. It was originally developed in the 1920s and 1930s by Daisy Canfield, wife of silent film star Antonio Moreno. Much of the Silver Lake Residential Historic District is associated with this tract.\nThe Silver Lake neighborhood council has mapped the boundaries of its council region.\n\nHistory\nThe area known as Ivanhoe to the north of the current reservoir was originally developed by Byram & Poindexter as early as 1887, named for Sir Walter Scott's book of the same name with many streets in that area referencing other works and characters such as Herkimer, Rowena, Kenilworth, Ben Lomond, Hawick, and St. George. \n\n In 1904 the Fletcher Drive Viaduct was constructed at the northeastern boundary of Silver Lake for the Glendale Line of the Pacific Electric Railway Company, connecting the area to Downtown Los Angeles. Originally constructed of timber, the viaduct was replaced in 1928 by a steel span construction to make way for Fletcher Drive underneath it. It was demolished in 1959 and only its concrete footings remain.\nWilliam Mulholland identified the area as an ideal location to place emergency reservoirs for the rapidly growing city, building the upper Ivanhoe Reservoir in 1906 and the eponymous Silver Lake reservoir in 1907. The reservoir was named for influential former LA City Councilman and then City Water Commissioner Herman Silver, who was instrumental in gaining the approvals to purchase the 127 acres (51 ha) of land and the funding for the construction of the reservoir.\nThe hills of Ivanhoe and the neighboring Edendale had always attracted bohemians seeking safe haven from the prying eyes of polite society, and the further development of Silver Lake as a lush parkland only increased its appeal. The 1930s and 1940s saw artists, writers, actors and musicians join other progressives such as union organizers, civic activists, and communists flock to the area. With them came the area's modern aesthetics as architects such as Gregory Ain, Craig Ellwood, John Lautner, Rudolph Schindler, Walter Dorwin Teague, and Raphael Soriano designed their houses and businesses, creating what local realtors now point out as having more architecturally significant homes per square mile in Silver Lake than in other parts of Los Angeles.\n\nWilliam Selig set up what may have been the first permanent film studio in Los Angeles in the Edendale neighborhood to the east of Ivanhoe valley in 1909, soon followed by Mack Sennett in 1912. Walt Disney's first studio was at the corner of Griffith Park Boulevard and Hyperion Avenue, currently the site of Gelson's Market. As a consequence, the name \"Hyperion\" is used by The Walt Disney Company and its subsidiaries, with company entities past and present carrying the name, such as Hyperion Books and the Hyperion Theater at Disney California Adventure Park. The fictional Seattle neighborhood of Hyperion Heights in the final season of the Disney-owned ABC series Once Upon a Time traces its name to the same origin.\nWilliam Fox would buy Selig's former Edendale lot on Glendale Boulevard in the 1917, building a 12-acre (4.9 ha) backlot called Mixville for Western film star Tom Mix. The location is now known as the Mixville Shopping Center and occupied by a Whole Foods Market. It is rumored that Mix buried his steed \"Old Blue\" on the property.\nThe neighborhood is crisscrossed by numerous municipal staircases that provide pedestrian access up and down the neighborhood's signature hills. Among these are the Descanso Stairs, Redcliff Stairs and the Music Box Stairs. The famous flight of stairs in Laurel and Hardy's film The Music Box is located between lower Descanso Drive and Vendome Street, as it winds up and around the hill.\nIn the 1940s, Chinese-American architect Eugene Kinn Choy sought to build a house for his family in Silver Lake, but due to racial covenants still in effect prohibiting the sale of property to \"any person not of the Caucasian race,\" he was prevented from doing so. He went door to door to seek the approval of every house in the neighborhood before he was given approval to build in 1949.\nChoy's groundbreaking efforts opened the door to the Asian American and Latino communities in the 1950s and 1960s. Beginning in the 1970s, the neighborhood became the nexus of Los Angeles' gay leather subculture, similar to the SoMA neighborhood in San Francisco. Since the late 1990s, gentrification has changed the area by pushing out public sex and \"gay cruising\" and facilitating the opening of many independent upscale boutiques, coffee shops, fitness studios, and restaurants.\nThe community continues to evolve, incorporating its bohemian roots with its racial and sexual diversity of the mid 20th century as architects such as Barbara Bestor and Gustavo Gubel, artists such as cache and Eric Junker, and musicians like Moby and Flea continue to define Silver Lake\u2019s environment as a cultural and creative enclave.\n\nLGBT community\nIn the 1930s, Silver Lake and Echo Park still comprised Edendale and acted as a space where members of the LGBT community were able to express their identities. Prominent female impersonator Julian Eltinge built his house in Silver Lake and performed until the city passed laws criminalizing cross-dressing, after which he continued to recount his drag performances to audiences.\nSilver Lake was also home to Harry Hay, credited with founding the first gay organization, the Mattachine Society, which began as Bachelors' Anonymous. Hay lived and had meetings in Silver Lake at the time the group began in 1950. Kevin Roderick wrote in his eulogy for Hay in Los Angeles that many consider the house located near Silver Lake to be the birthplace of the gay-rights movement.\nThe Black Cat Tavern, a fairly popular bar that has now become a historic-cultural monument, was the site of a police raid in 1967 that spread to adjacent bars, becoming a full-blown riot, which resulted in more than a dozen arrests. The protests in response to the raid predated the Stonewall riots by two years.\nLos Globos is another popular bar that has become the site of Banjee Balls where LGBT youth come together. Voguing is a large part of the balls and brings a Paris Is Burning vibe into Los Angeles night life. The building was originally one of the earliest American Legion halls. Circus of Books was a bookstore and gay pornography shop that was notable as a gay cruising spot of the late 20th Century.\nAs the AIDS epidemic gripped the US in the 1980s, tensions between gay men and the LAPD escalated. Several LGBT activists in Silver Lake claimed they felt unsafe reporting hate crimes against them to the police, who they felt harbored anti-LGBT sentiments. Their complaints grew to the point that then-City Council member Michael Woo advocated establishing a hotline to relay information to police indirectly and compile statistics on the frequency of gay-bashings. Some bath houses, which acted as social spaces for gay men, were shut down by the city government in an effort to curb the spread of the virus. The ensuing controversy reflected a nationwide debate about whether this type of action constituted public health policy or perpetuation of discrimination against the LGBT community.\nIn 1992, about 85 activists protested gay-bashing and violent acts against homosexuals in the area, carrying banners emblazoned with \u201cStop the Violence\u201d along Sunset Boulevard.\nIn 2019, Maebe A. Girl, who is non-binary and uses she\/her and they\/them pronouns, became the first drag queen ever elected to public office in the United States, owing to being elected to the Silver Lake Neighborhood Council.\n\nReservoir\nThe neighborhood was named for Water Board Commissioner Herman Silver, who was instrumental in the creation of the Silver Lake Reservoir in the neighborhood, one of the water storage reservoirs established as part of the controversial Los Angeles Aqueduct project in the early 1900s. This is one of ten that still remain in Los Angeles.\nIn the community of Silver Lake lies the namesake reservoir composed of two basins, with the lower named Silver Lake and the upper named Ivanhoe. The lower body of water was named in 1906 for Herman Silver; the upper body received its name from the 1819 Sir Walter Scott novel Ivanhoe.\nThe reservoirs are owned and maintained by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) and provided water to 600,000 homes in downtown and South Los Angeles until 2013 when federal water quality regulations mandated reservoirs be covered; however, only the smaller of the two, Ivanhoe, remains online. At capacity, they hold 795 million gallons of water. The Silver Lake Reservoir's water resources was replaced by the Headworks Reservoir, an underground reservoir north of Griffith Park, slated for completion by December 2017.\nAlso within the grounds of the reservoir are several popular recreational facilities: the Silver Lake Recreation Center, which includes an adjacent city park; the 2.25-mile (3.62 km) Silver Lake Walking Path, which circumnavigates the reservoirs; two enclosed dog parks, and the Silver Lake Meadow, modeled after NYC's Central Park Sheep Meadow. On the northeast corner of the property is the Neighborhood Nursery School, which since 1976 has been at the corner of Tesla Avenue and Silver Lake Boulevard. It is a parent-participation cooperative preschool, affiliated with the California Council of Parent Participation Nursery Schools.\n\nGovernment\nAs of 2024, Silver Lake is represented by Los Angeles City Council Members Hugo Soto-Martinez and Nithya Raman and the Silver Lake Neighborhood Council. The Silver Lake Neighborhood Council (SLNC) was formed in the early 2000s and certified as part of the City of Los Angeles Neighborhood Council system in February 2003. Its 21-member governing board is elected for two-year terms in September. Recent projects have included \"Street Medallions\" created by artist Cheri Gaulke, \"ArtCans\", the \"Electrical Art Box Project\", and the second annual \"Make Music LA\" created by several different artists, groups, and the SLNC Arts & Culture Committee, whose current co-chairs are Renee Dawson and Dulce Stein.\nThe Silver Lake Residents Association, the Silver Lake Improvement Association, the Silver Lake Reservoirs Conservancy, and the Silver Lake Chamber of Commerce are all active in the area.\n\nDemographics\nThe 2000 U.S. census counted 30,972 residents in the 2.75 square miles (7.1 km2) neighborhood\u2014an average of 11,266 people per square mile, about the same population density as in the rest of the city but among the highest in the county. In 2008 the city estimated that the population had increased to 32,890. The median age for residents was 35, about average for Los Angeles, but the percentages of residents aged 19 to 49 were among the county's highest.\nThe neighborhood was highly diverse ethnically. The breakdown was Latinos, 41.8%; whites, 34%; Asians and Asian Americans, 18%; blacks, 3.2%; and others, 3.1%. Mexico (26.6%) and the Philippines (15.7%) were the most common places of birth for the 41% of the residents who were born abroad, about the same rate as the city at large.\nThe median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $54,339, about the same as the rest of Los Angeles, but a high percentage of households earned $20,000 or less per year. The average household size of 2.3 people was low for the city. Renters occupied 64.3% of the housing stock, and house or apartment owners the rest.\nThe percentages of never-married men (52.6%) and women (38.6%) were among the county's highest. Both statistics could be due in part to the large numbers of LGBT members in the community.\n\nEducation\nThirty-six percent of neighborhood residents aged 25 and older had earned a four-year college degree by 2000, an average figure for the city.\n\nSchools\nThe schools within Silver Lake are as follows:\n\nLibrary\nThe Silver Lake District is also served by the Silver Lake Branch of the Los Angeles Public Library. It is located at 2411 Glendale Boulevard, in northeastern Silver Lake between the reservoir and the I-5 freeway.\n\nEntertainment and nightlife\nSilver Lake, known as one of \"the city's hippest neighborhoods\", has many bars, nightclubs and restaurants. Since the 1990s, the neighborhood has become the center of the alternative and indie rock scene in Los Angeles. It was home to two major yearly street festivals: the Silver Lake Jubilee, held in May and the Sunset Junction Street Fair, held in August. The last Sunset Junction festival was held in 2010 and abruptly cancelled in 2011 just days before it was supposed to take place, after years of neighborhood controversy. The Silver Lake Jubilee, the more recent addition, featured live music by local musicians, local artists and community businesses. It moved to the Arts District and changed its name to the Jubilee Music and Arts Festival in 2013.\nA comparison has been drawn between New York City's Williamsburg neighborhood and Silver Lake, which has been called the \"Williamsburg of the West\".\n\nIn popular culture\nIn addition to being the site of early Western films' star Tom Mix's studio on Glendale Boulevard, Silver Lake has been used as the film location for several films and television shows and also shown in some video games. \n\nSilent star Antonio Moreno and his wife Daisy Canfield Moreno's Canfield-Moreno Estate has been frequently used as a filming location.\nThe Laurel and Hardy film The Music Box used the neighborhood's municipal staircase, now known as the  Music Box Stairs, between lower Descanso Drive and Vendome Street.\nSunset Triangle Plaza is featured in AMC's Fear The Walking Dead's pilot episode.

The hotels are operated by Standard International Management. The two original properties in Hollywood and Los Angeles closed in 2021 and 2022 respectively.\n\nHistory\nThe first Standard Hotel, The Standard, Hollywood,  opened on the Sunset Strip in 1999 in West Hollywood, California. It was developed by Andre Balazs Properties. The structure was originally built in 1962 as the Thunderbird Motel, and had become a retirement home when Balazs purchased and remodeled it. Original investors in the Hollywood hotel were Leonardo DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz, Benicio del Toro, D'arcy Wretzky and James Iha.\n\nIn 2002, the former headquarters of the Superior Oil Company (completed in 1956) a twelve-story, marble-clad building was converted into The Standard, Downtown LA in 2002. The renovation was designed by Koning Eizenberg Architecture, Inc., and included the addition of a rooftop pool and bar, and a two-story lobby space reconfigured from the old banking hall. In 2003, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The building was rebranded as The Delphi Hotel in 2023.\nIn 2006, The Standard Hotels expanded to Miami Beach, where they opened The Standard Spa, Miami Beach. Located on Biscayne Bay, The Standard Spa, Miami Beach, is a holistic and hydrotherapy-oriented spa hotel.\n\nIn 2008, The Standard Hotels brand completed their most ambitious project to date, with the opening of The Standard, High Line. It was the first time the brand built a property from the ground up, rather than renovating an older space. The design was the work of the Ennead Architects.\nIn 2011, Andre Balazs properties completed the acquisition of The Cooper Square Hotel. The building was gutted and transformed into The Standard, East Village.\nIn the Fall of 2013, the brand's founder, Andre Balazs, sold an 80% stake in the company to Standard International.\nIn July 2019, a property in London opened.\nOn November 1, 2019, a property in Maldives opened.\nThe Standard Hollywood, which closed temporarily in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, closed permanently on January 22, 2021, due to a 2019 increase in the lease price on the hotel and the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Standard Downtown LA, which also closed temporarily in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, never reopened, was closed permanently on January 22, 2022.\nOn August 20, 2024, Hyatt Hotels Corporation announced its plans to acquire Standard International and the brands within its portfolio, including The Standard, The StandardX, The Peri, Bunkhouse Hotels and The Manner. Hyatt plans to integrate all current and pipeline hotels into its World of Hyatt loyalty program by the end of 2024, as well as establish a new lifestyle hotels division out of New York City that will be led by a combination of Standard and Hyatt executives to oversee the development of its lifestyle hotel brands.\n\nLocations\nThe Standard Spa, Miami Beach (Miami Beach, Florida), a holistic and hydrotherapy spa hotel on Biscayne Bay \u2013 2006\nThe Standard, High Line (New York City), straddling the High Line in the Meatpacking District of Manhattan \u2013 2008\nThe Standard, East Village (New York City), formerly the Cooper Square Hotel \u2013 2011\nThe Standard, London \u2013 2019\nThe Standard, Maldives \u2013 2019\nThe Standard, Hua Hin \u2013 2021\nThe Standard, Ibiza \u2013 2022\nThe Standard, Bangkok Mahanakhon \u2013 2022\n\nUpcoming locations\nThe Standard, Melbourne \u2013 2023\nThe Standard, Singapore \u2013 2023\nThe Standard, Lisbon \u2013 2024\nThe Standard, Dublin \u2013 2024\nThe Standard, Brussels \u2013 2025\n\nFormer locations\nThe Standard Hollywood in West Hollywood \u2013 1999\u20132021\nThe Standard, Downtown LA, formerly the Superior Oil Company Building \u2013 2002\u20132022\n\nReferences\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n\nFarr, Louise (March 1999), \"Setting the Standard: Well before its opening, the Standard is already attracting the young and trendy\", W Magazine, pp. Volume 28 Issue 3\nTyrnauer, Matt (February 1999), \"Hop on the High Line\", Vanity Fair\nTyrnauer, Matt (March 1999), \"Hotel California: The Standard, Andre Balazs' newest hotel, is designed to lure the young and restless by marrying the chi with cheap and past with future\", Vanity Fair, pp. 102, 104, 110\nVerbila, S.

Spago is Puck's first restaurant venture.\n\nName and history\nThe word \"spago\" is Italian for \"string\" or \"twine\". The plural would be \"spaghi,\" which is the beginning of \"spaghetti\", and suggests that pasta is on the menu.\nThe first Spago location opened in 1982, on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood, California, with Mark Peel as chef de cuisine under Puck. The second Spago restaurant opened at The Forum Shops at Caesars Palace, on the Las Vegas Strip in 1992. It was closed in 2017 and relocated to Bellagio Las Vegas in spring 2018. In 1997, Wolfgang Puck opened a third location on Canon Drive in Beverly Hills.  In 1998, a Spago location opened in Palo Alto which was closed in 2007.\nThe original Spago Hollywood remained open until 2001 when Wolfgang Puck and his partners determined renovating the original 1920s-era house would be too costly. They let their lease on the location expire.\n\nTwo additional locations opened at Four Seasons Resort Maui, in Hawaii (in 2001); and in the Ritz-Carlton Bachelor Gulch, in Avon, Colorado (which closed in 2016). Spago opened its first location outside of the United States in Mexico City in the mid-1990s, which closed a few years later. It later opened a restaurant in Istanbul, Turkey, at the St. Regis Hotel in 2015.

The sex act may be performed in the customer's car, in a nearby secluded street location, or at the prostitute's residence or in a rented motel room.\n\nLegality\nStreet prostitution is often illegal, even in jurisdictions that allow other forms of prostitution.\nIt is estimated that only 10-20 percent of sex workers are working on the streets; however, it is also estimated that 90 percent of the arrests of prostitutes are of street workers.\nIn some jurisdictions where prostitution itself is legal, such as in the United Kingdom, street prostitution has been made illegal.\nSome jurisdictions also outlaw kerb crawling, slowly driving around with the intent to procure the services of a prostitute.\nIn Australia, in New South Wales it is legal to solicit on the streets, except in some areas (such as near schools). The other Australian states and territories prohibit street solicitation, although some of these jurisdictions allow licensed brothels.\nStreet prostitution is legal in New Zealand. In Germany it is allowed too, but cities can restrict it to certain areas or hours (regulations vary widely from place to place).\nIn the United States, street prostitution is illegal in all 50 states; 49 of the states outlaw all forms of prostitution. Nevada allows licensed brothels, but only in some rural areas, not in the major metropolitan areas (only eight counties have active brothels and prostitution outside these brothels is illegal throughout the state).\nIn four towns in the Netherlands, a special zone (tippelzone) is designated for legal street prostitution. The zone is often in a business park to avoid inconvenience for residents and can include a sex drive-in (afwerkplek).  In most of the zones, the prostitutes need a licence.\n\nRisks and research\nStreet prostitutes are extremely vulnerable to physical and sexual assaults, as well as to muggings by clients and pimps.\nThe World Health Organization reported that a study in Bangladesh found that between 50% and 60% of street-based prostitutes had been raped by men in uniform, and between 40% and 50% had been raped by local clients.\nMelissa Farley's study of 854 prostitutes in nine countries\u2014Canada, Colombia, Germany, Mexico, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, the United States, and Zambia\u2014found that 95% of prostitutes had been physically assaulted, and 75% had been raped. 89% of the women interviewed stated that they wanted to leave prostitution. However, the methodology and neutrality of Farley's studies has been criticised by other academics such as Ronald Weitzer.  Weitzer has also said that Farley's findings are heavily influenced by radical feminist ideology.\nIn a 2008 study of Chicago, USA street prostitutes, economists Steven D. Levitt and Sudhir Alladi Venkatesh found that women working without pimps work for an average hourly rate of about $25, and those working with pimps make 50% more. This is roughly four times the wage of other jobs available to them. Prostitutes are arrested once for every 450 encounters and every 10th arrest results in jail time.\nIn 2004, a study in the UK showed that up to 95% of women in street prostitution were problematic drug users, including around 78% heroin users and rising numbers of crack cocaine addicts.\n\nImpact of COVID-19\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, contact professions (which includes prostitution, amongst others) had been banned (temporarily) in some countries. This has resulted in a local reduction of prostitution.\n\nSee also\nSolicitation\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nStreet prostitution Archived 2003-11-29 at the Wayback Machine by Michael S.

It is named after a major street that runs through Hollywood.\nThe film stars William Holden as Joe Gillis, a struggling screenwriter, and Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond, a former silent-film star who draws him into her deranged fantasy world, where she dreams of making a triumphant return to the screen. Erich von Stroheim plays Max von Mayerling, her devoted butler, and Nancy Olson, Jack Webb, Lloyd Gough, and Fred Clark appear in supporting roles. Director Cecil B. DeMille and gossip columnist Hedda Hopper play themselves, and the film includes cameo appearances by silent-film stars Buster Keaton, H. B. Warner, and Anna Q. Nilsson.\nPraised by many critics when first released, Sunset Boulevard was nominated for 11 Academy Awards (including nominations in all four acting categories) and won three. It is often ranked among the greatest movies ever made. As it was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the U.S. Library of Congress in 1989, Sunset Boulevard was included in the first group of films selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. In 1998, it was ranked number 12 on the American Film Institute's list of the 100 best American films of the 20th century. In 2007, it was 16th on their 10th Anniversary list.\n\nPlot\nAt a mansion on Sunset Boulevard, police officers and photographers discover the body of Joe Gillis floating face down in the swimming pool. In a flashback, Joe relates the events leading to his death.\nSix months earlier, Joe is a down-on-his-luck screenwriter trying to interest Paramount Pictures in a story he submitted. Script reader Betty Schaefer harshly critiques it, unaware that Joe is listening. Later, while fleeing from repo men seeking his car, Joe turns into the driveway of a seemingly deserted mansion inhabited by forgotten silent film star Norma Desmond. Learning that Joe is a writer, Norma asks his opinion of a script she has written for a film about Salome. She plans to play the role herself in her return to the screen. Joe finds her script abysmal, but flatters her into hiring him as a script doctor.\nJoe moves into Norma's mansion at her insistence, and sees that Norma refuses to believe that her fame has evaporated. Her butler Max secretly writes all of the fan mail that she receives in order to maintain the illusion. At her New Year's Eve party, Joe realizes that she has fallen in love with him. He tries to let her down gently, but Norma slaps him and retreats to her room, distraught. Joe visits his friend Artie Green and again meets Betty, who thinks a scene in one of Joe's scripts has potential. When he phones Max to have him pack his things, Max tells him Norma has cut her wrists with his razor. Joe then returns to Norma, and their relationship becomes sexual.\nNorma has Max deliver the edited Salome script to her former director Cecil B. DeMille at Paramount. She starts getting calls from Paramount executive Gordon Cole but refuses to speak to anyone except DeMille. Eventually, she has Max drive her and Joe to Paramount in her 1929 Isotta Fraschini. DeMille welcomes her affectionately and treats her with great respect, but tactfully evades her questions about the script. Max then learns that Cole only called her because he wants to rent her Isotta Fraschini for use in a film.\nPreparing for her imagined comeback, Norma undergoes rigorous beauty treatments. Joe secretly works nights in Betty's office, collaborating on an original screenplay. Max discovers his moonlighting, who then reveals that he was once a respected film director who discovered Norma, made her a star, and was her first husband. After she divorces him, he abandons his career to become her servant.\nNorma discovers a manuscript with Joe and Betty's names on it and phones Betty, insinuating that Joe is not the man he seems. Overhearing the call, Joe invites Betty to the mansion to see for herself. When she arrives, he pretends that he is satisfied being a gigolo so that she can be with Artie. However, after she tearfully leaves, he packs to return to his old newspaper job in Dayton, Ohio. He bluntly informs Norma that there will be no comeback, that Max writes all of her fan mail, and that she has been forgotten. He disregards Norma's threat to kill herself as she brandishes a gun; as he leaves the house, Norma shoots him three times, and he collapses into the pool.\nThe flashback ends and the film returns to the present day, with Norma about to be arrested for murder. The mansion is overrun with police and reporters with newsreel cameras, which she believes are film cameras. Max pretends to \"direct\" her, and the police play along. As the cameras roll, Norma descends the grand staircase for what she thinks is a close-up for DeMille. She stops and makes an impromptu speech about how happy she is to be making a film again, then walks towards the camera, before she gets arrested by the authorities.\n\nCast\nProduction\nBackground\nThe street known as Sunset Boulevard has been associated with Hollywood film production since 1911, when the town's first film studio, Nestor, opened there. The film workers lived modestly in the growing neighborhood, but during the 1920s, profits and salaries rose to unprecedented levels. With the advent of the star system, luxurious homes noted for their often incongruous grandeur were built in the area.\nAs a young man living in Berlin in the 1920s, Billy Wilder was interested in American culture, with much of his interest fueled by the country's films. In the late 1940s, many of the grand Hollywood houses remained, and Wilder, then a Los Angeles resident, found them to be a part of his everyday world. Many former stars from the silent era still lived in them, although most were no longer involved in the film business. Wilder wondered how they spent their time now that \"the parade had passed them by\" and began imagining the story of a star who had lost her celebrity and box-office appeal.\nThe character of Norma Desmond mirrors aspects of the twilight years of several real-life faded silent-film stars, such as the reclusive existences of Mary Pickford and Pola Negri and the mental disorders of Mae Murray, Valeska Surratt, Audrey Munson and Clara Bow. Dave Kehr has asserted that Norma Talmadge is \"the obvious if unacknowledged source of Norma Desmond, the grotesque, predatory silent movie queen\" of the film. The most common analysis of the character's name is that it is a combination of the names of silent film actress Mabel Normand and director William Desmond Taylor, a close friend of Normand's who was murdered in 1922 in a never-solved case sensationalized by the press.\n\nWriting\nCinematographer John Seitz stated that Wilder \"had wanted to do Evelyn Waugh's 1948 novel The Loved One, but couldn\u2019t obtain the rights.\" Waugh's story follows a failed screenwriter who lives with a silent film star and works in a cemetery. Gossip columnist Hedda Hopper, who plays herself in the movie, wrote that \"Billy Wilder \u2026 was crazy about Evelyn Waugh's book The Loved One, and the studio wanted to buy it.\" Regardless, the plans for this adaptation fell through. The original script that followed nevertheless contains similarities to the novel. At one point, Norma mistakes Joe for a funeral director and inquires about a coffin for herself and her deceased pet chimp.\nWilder and Brackett began working on a script in 1948, but the result did not completely satisfy them. In August 1948, D. M. Marshman Jr., formerly a writer for Life, was hired to help develop the storyline after Wilder and Brackett were impressed by a critique he provided of their film The Emperor Waltz (1948). In an effort to keep the full details of the story from Paramount Pictures and avoid the restrictive censorship of the Breen Code, they submitted the script a few pages at a time. The Breen Office insisted certain lines be rewritten, such as Gillis's \"I'm up that creek and I need a job,\" which became \"I'm over a barrel. I need a job.\" Paramount executives thought Wilder was adapting a story called A Can of Beans (which did not exist) and allowed him relative freedom to proceed as he saw fit. Only the first third of the script was written when filming began in early May 1949, and Wilder was unsure how the film would end.\n\nThe fusion of writer-director Billy Wilder's biting humor and the classic elements of film noir make for a strange kind of comedy, as well as a strange kind of film noir. There are no belly laughs here, but there are certainly strangled giggles: at the pet chimp's midnight funeral, at Joe's discomfited acquiescence to the role of gigolo; at Norma's Mack Sennett-style \"entertainments\" for her uneasy lover; and at the ritualized solemnity of Norma's \"waxworks\" card parties, which feature such former luminaries as Buster Keaton as Norma's has-been cronies.\nWilder preferred to leave analysis of his screenplays and films to others. When asked if Sunset Boulevard was a black comedy, he replied: \"No, just a picture\".\n\nCasting\nAccording to Brackett, Wilder and he never considered anyone except Gloria Swanson for the role of Norma Desmond. Wilder, however, recalled first wanting Mae West and Marlon Brando for the leads. West rejected the offer outright. West portrayed herself as a sex symbol through her senior years, and was offended that she should be asked to play a Hollywood has-been.\nThe filmmakers approached Greta Garbo, whom they had worked with previously on Ninotchka (1939), but she was not interested. Wilder contacted Pola Negri by telephone, but had a difficult time understanding her heavy Polish accent. He then reached out to Clara Bow, the famed \"It girl\" of the 1920s, but she declined citing that she had no interest in engaging in the film industry again due to how hard it was for her during the transition of sound films and that she'd prefer to remain in seclusion with her husband and sons while leaving her previous life behind her. They also offered the part of Norma Desmond to Norma Shearer, but she rejected the role due to both her retirement and distaste for the script. They were considering Fred MacMurray to play opposite her as Joe. Wilder and Brackett then visited Mary Pickford, but before even discussing the plot with her, Wilder realized she would consider a role involving an affair with a man half her age an insult, so they departed. They had considered pairing Montgomery Clift with her.\nAccording to Wilder, he asked George Cukor for advice, and he suggested Swanson, one of the most f\u00eated actresses of the silent-screen era, known for her beauty, talent, and extravagant lifestyle. In many ways, she resembled the Norma Desmond character, and like her, had been unable to make a smooth transition into talking pictures. The similarities ended there; Swanson made a handful of talking pictures. She accepted the end of her film career and, in the early 1930s, moved to New York City, where she worked in radio. In the mid-1940s, she worked in television and on the New York stage and had last appeared in the 1941 film Father Takes a Wife. Though Swanson was not seeking a movie comeback, she became intrigued when Wilder discussed the role with her.\nSwanson was glad for the opportunity to earn a greater salary than she had been making in television and on stage. However, she was chagrined at the notion of submitting to a screen test, saying she had \"made 20 films for Paramount. Why do they want me to audition?\" Her reaction was echoed in the screenplay when Norma Desmond declares, \"Without me there wouldn't be any Paramount studios.\" In her memoir, Swanson recalled asking Cukor if it was unreasonable to refuse the screen test. He replied that since Norma Desmond was the role for which she would be remembered, \"If they ask you to do ten screen tests, do ten screen tests, or I will personally shoot you.\" His enthusiasm convinced Swanson to participate, and she signed a contract for $50,000 (equivalent to $630,000 in 2023). In a 1975 interview, Wilder recalled Swanson's reaction with the observation, \"There was a lot of Norma in her, you know.\"\nWilder harks back to Swanson's silent film career when Norma shows Joe the film Queen Kelly, an earlier Gloria Swanson film directed by Erich von Stroheim, who himself portrays Norma's butler and former director and husband Max von Mayerling. Queen Kelly was not released in the United States for over 50 years after Swanson walked off the set.\nMontgomery Clift was signed to play Joe Gillis for $5,000 per week for a guaranteed twelve weeks, but withdrew just before the start of filming, claiming his role of a young man involved with an older woman was too close to the one he had played in The Heiress (1949), in which he felt he had been unconvincing. An infuriated Wilder responded, \"If he's any kind of actor, he could be convincing making love to any woman.\" Clift himself was having an affair with a woman 15 years his senior, the singer Libby Holman, which some have suggested was his real reason for withdrawing from the film.\nForced to consider the available Paramount contract players, Wilder and Brackett focused on William Holden, who had made an impressive debut a decade earlier in Golden Boy (1939). Following an appearance in Our Town (1940), he served in the military in World War II, and his return to the screen afterward had been moderately successful. Holden was enthusiastic about the script and eager to accept the role. He did not know at the time that his salary of $39,000 (equivalent to $490,000 in 2023) was much less than had been offered to Clift.\nFor the role of Betty Schaefer, Wilder wanted a newcomer who could project a wholesome and ordinary image to contrast with Swanson's flamboyant and obsessive Desmond. He chose Nancy Olson, who had recently been considered for the role of Delilah in Cecil B. DeMille's Samson and Delilah.\nDeMille, often credited as the person most responsible for making Swanson a star, plays himself, with his scenes filmed on the set of Samson and Delilah at Paramount Studios. He calls Norma \"young fella\", which had been his nickname for Swanson.\nNorma's friends who come to play bridge with her, referred to by Joe as \"the waxworks\", were Swanson's silent-era contemporaries Buster Keaton, Anna Q. Nilsson, and H. B. Warner, portraying themselves. Hedda Hopper also played herself, reporting on Norma Desmond's downfall in the film's final scenes.\n\nCinematography and design\nThe film's dark, shadowy black-and-white cinematography was the work of John F. Seitz. Wilder had worked with Seitz on several projects before, and trusted his judgment, allowing him to make his own decisions. Seitz recalled asking Wilder what he required for the pet chimpanzee's funeral scene, to which Wilder replied, \"you know, just your standard monkey funeral shot.\" For some interior shots, Seitz sprinkled dust in front of the camera before filming to suggest \"mustiness,\" a technique he had also used for Wilder's Double Indemnity (1944). The film had the option to be shot in color, but it was instead shot in black and white to be more reflective of the noir genre.\n\nWilder was adamant that the corpse of Joe Gillis be seen from the bottom of the pool, but creating the effect was difficult. The camera was placed inside a specially constructed box and lowered under water, but the result disappointed Wilder, who insisted on further experiments. The shot was finally achieved by placing a mirror on the bottom of the pool and filming Holden's reflection from above, with the distorted image of the police officers standing around the pool forming a backdrop.\nFilm historian Tom Stempel writes: \"In both Double Indemnity and Sunset Boulevard, Seitz does something that has always impressed me. Both are films noir, and he finesses the fact that both are set in the sunniest of locales, Los Angeles... he brings together the light and the dark in the same film without any seams showing... he brings together the realistic lighting of Joe Gillis out in the real world with the gothic look of Norma Desmond's mansion.\"\nEdith Head designed the costumes. Wilder, Head, and Swanson agreed that Norma Desmond would have kept somewhat up-to-date with fashion trends, so Head designed costumes closely resembling the Dior look of the mid-1940s. Embellishments were added to personalize them and reflect Norma Desmond's taste.\nSwanson recalled in her biography that the costumes were only \"a trifle outdated, a trifle exotic.\" Head later described her assignment as \"the most challenging of my career,\" and explained her approach with the comment, \"Because Norma Desmond was an actress who had become lost in her own imagination, I tried to make her look like she was always impersonating someone.\" Head later said she relied on Swanson's expertise because \"she was creating a past that she knew and I didn't.\" Head also designed the costumes for William Holden and the minor characters, but Wilder instructed von Stroheim and Nancy Olson to wear their own clothing.\nThe overstated decadence of Norma Desmond's home was created by set designer Hans Dreier, whose career extended back to the silent era. He had also been commissioned to complete the interior design for the homes of movie stars, including the house of Mae West. William Haines, an interior designer and former actor, later rebutted criticism of Dreier's set design with the observation, \"Bebe Daniels, Norma Shearer, and Pola Negri all had homes with ugly interiors like that.\"\nThe bed in the shape of a boat in which Norma Desmond slept had been owned by the dancer Gaby Deslys, who died in 1920. It had originally been bought by the Universal prop department at auction after Deslys's death. The bed appeared in The Phantom of the Opera (1925) starring Lon Chaney.\nWilder also made use of authentic locales. Joe's apartment is in the Alto Nido, a real apartment block in central Hollywood that was often home to struggling writers. It is located at 1851 Ivar Ave. and Franklin Ave. west of the Hollywood Freeway. The scenes of Gillis and Betty Schaefer on Paramount's back lot were filmed on the actual studio back lot, and the interior of Schwab's Drug Store was carefully recreated for several scenes. The exterior scenes of the Desmond house were filmed at a house on Wilshire Boulevard built during the 1920s by the millionaire William O. Jenkins. Jenkins and his family lived in it for only one year before then leaving it abandoned for more than a decade, which earned it the nickname \"Phantom House\". By 1949, it was owned by the former wife of J. Paul Getty. The house was later featured in Nicholas Ray's Rebel Without a Cause (1955). It was demolished by the Gettys in 1957 to make way for the construction of an office building.\nDuring filming, considerable publicity was given to the health-conscious Gloria Swanson's youthful appearance, which made her look the same age as Holden. Wilder insisted that the age difference between the characters be delineated, and instructed makeup supervisor Wally Westmore to make Swanson look older. Swanson argued that a woman of Norma Desmond's age, with her considerable wealth and devotion to self, would not necessarily look old, and suggested Holden be made up to appear younger. Wilder agreed, and Westmore was assigned this task, which allowed Swanson to portray Norma Desmond as more glamorous a figure than Wilder had originally imagined.\n\nScore\nFranz Waxman's musical score was the final element added to Sunset Boulevard. His theme for Norma was based on tango music, inspired by her having danced the tango with Rudolph Valentino. This style was contrasted with Joe's bebop theme. Waxman also used distorted arrangements of popular film-music styles from the 1920s and 1930s to suggest Norma Desmond's state of mind. The film's score was recorded for compact disc by the Scottish Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Joel McNeely, and released in 2002. The surviving parts of the original score were released in 2010.\n\nOriginal release and responses\nPreviews and revision\nWilder and Brackett, nervous about a major screening in Hollywood, held a preview in Evanston, Illinois, in late 1949. The original edit opened with a scene inside a morgue, with the assembled corpses discussing how they came to be there. The story began with the corpse of Joe Gillis recounting his murder to the others. The audience reacted with laughter and seemed unsure whether to view the rest of the film as drama or comedy. After a similar reaction during its second screening in Poughkeepsie, New York, and a third in Great Neck, the morgue opening was replaced by a shorter poolside opening, using footage filmed on January 5, 1950.\nIn Hollywood, Paramount arranged a private screening for the various studio heads and specially invited guests. After viewing the film, Barbara Stanwyck knelt to kiss the hem of Gloria Swanson's skirt. Swanson later remembered looking for Mary Pickford, only to be told, \"She can't show herself, Gloria. She's too overcome. We all are.\" Louis B. Mayer berated Wilder before the crowd of celebrities, saying, \"You have disgraced the industry that made and fed you! You should be tarred and feathered and run out of Hollywood!\" Upon hearing of Mayer's slight, Wilder strode up to the mogul and retorted with a vulgarity that one biographer said was allegedly because Mayer, who was Jewish, suggested that Wilder, who was also Jewish, would be better off being sent back to Germany, an extraordinary sentiment so soon after the war and the Holocaust, in which Wilder's family perished. In 2020 Olson recounted that friends who had attended the screening told her that Wilder had simply told Mayer \"Go fuck yourself.\"\nThe few other criticisms were not so venomous. According to one often-told but later discredited anecdote, actress Mae Murray, a contemporary of Swanson, was offended by the film and commented, \"None of us floozies was that nuts.\"\n\nPremiere and box-office receipts\nSunset Boulevard had its official world premiere at Radio City Music Hall on August 10, 1950. After a seven-week run, Variety magazine reported the film had grossed \"around $1,020,000\", ($12,917,178 in 2023 dollars ) making it one of that theater's most successful pictures. Variety also noted that, while it was \"breaking records in major cities, it is doing below average in ... the sticks.\" To promote the film, Gloria Swanson traveled by train throughout the United States, visiting 33 cities in a few months. The publicity helped attract people to the cinemas, but in many areas away from major cities it was considered less than a hit.\nThe film earned an estimated $2,350,000 at the U.S. box office in 1950 ($29,760,166 in 2023 dollars ).\n\nCritical response\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 98% of critics gave the film a positive review based on 112 reviews, with an average rating of 9.5\/10. The critical consensus states: \"Arguably the greatest movie about Hollywood, Billy Wilder's masterpiece Sunset Boulevard is a tremendously entertaining combination of noir, black comedy, and character study.\"\n\nContemporary\nSunset Boulevard attracted a range of positive reviews from critics. Time described it as a story of \"Hollywood at its worst told by Hollywood at its best\", while Boxoffice Review wrote \"the picture will keep spectators spellbound.\" James Agee, writing for Sight & Sound, praised the film and said Wilder and Brackett were \"beautifully equipped to do the cold, exact, adroit, sardonic job they have done.\" Good Housekeeping described Swanson as a \"great lady [who] spans another decade with her magic,\" while Look praised her \"brilliant and haunting performance.\"\nSome critics accurately foresaw the film's lasting appeal. The Hollywood Reporter wrote that future generations would \"set themselves the task of analyzing the durability and greatness\" of the film, while Commonweal said that in the future \"the Library of Congress will be glad to have in its archives a print of Sunset Boulevard.\"\nIn a rare negative review of the film, The New Yorker deemed it \"a pretentious slice of Roquefort\" containing only \"the germ of a good idea\". Despite praising it as a \"great motion picture\" with \"memorable\" acting, Thomas M. Pryor wrote in The New York Times that the use of the dead Joe Gillis as narrator was a plot device \"completely unworthy of Brackett and Wilder\".\n\nRetrospective\nIn 1999, Roger Ebert described Swanson as giving \"one of the all time greatest [acting] performances\", but singled out von Stroheim's performance as \"hold[ing] the film together\". He included it in his Great Movies list, calling it \"the best drama ever made about the movies because it sees through the illusions.\" Pauline Kael described the film as \"almost too clever, but at its best in its cleverness\", and also wrote that it was common to \"hear Billy Wilder called the world's greatest director.\" When Wilder died in 2002, obituaries singled out Sunset Boulevard for comment, describing it as one of his most significant works, along with Double Indemnity and Some Like It Hot.\nFilm writer Richard Corliss describes Sunset Boulevard as \"the definitive Hollywood horror movie\", noting that almost everything in the script is \"ghoulish\". He remarks that the story is narrated by a dead man whom Norma Desmond first mistakes for an undertaker, while most of the film takes place \"in an old, dark house that only opens its doors to the living dead\". He compares von Stroheim's character Max with the concealed Erik, the central character in The Phantom of the Opera, and Norma Desmond with Dracula, noting that, as she seduces Joe Gillis, the camera tactfully withdraws with \"the traditional directorial attitude taken towards Dracula's jugular seductions\". He writes that the narrative contains an excess of \"cheap sarcasm\", but ultimately considers it a valuable part of Joe's characterization as a hack writer. David Thomson notes the irony of having Gillis tell the story: \"The man who can't dream up a viable story line becomes the best pitch he'll ever hear. He is the story and it is Billy Wilder's sour valedictory to let the ghost of Gillis tell the story, facedown in the gelid swimming pool exactly the Hollywood reward that Joe gets only in his dreams. And so this breathtaking portrait of Hollywood failure is wrapped up in rueful, ruined success.\"\n\nAwards and nominations\nOf the various films that have attracted Academy Award nominations in all four acting categories, Sunset Boulevard is one of only three not to win in any category, the others being My Man Godfrey (1936) and American Hustle (2013). At the time its eleven Oscar nominations were exceeded only by the fourteen received by All About Eve, which won six awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. Many critics predicted that the Best Actress award would be given to Gloria Swanson or Bette Davis for All About Eve and were surprised that the recipient was newcomer Judy Holliday for Born Yesterday. Bette Davis believed that her and Swanson's comparable characters effectively \"cancelled each other out\", allowing Holliday to win. Swanson recalled the press's reaction following Holliday's win: \"It slowly dawned on me that they were asking for a larger-than-life scene, or better still, a mad scene. More accurately, they were trying to flush out Norma Desmond.\"\nSunset Boulevard was dramatized as an hour-long radio play on the September 17, 1951, broadcast of Lux Radio Theater with Gloria Swanson and William Holden in their original film roles.\n\nRecognition since 1989\nIn 1989, the film was among the first group of 25 deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. The Village Voice ranked the film at No. 43 in its Top 250 \"Best Films of the Century\" list in 1999, based on a poll of critics. The film was included in \"The New York Times Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made\" in 2002. In January 2002, the film was voted at No. 87 on the list of the \"Top 100 Essential Films of All Time\" by the National Society of Film Critics. Sunset Boulevard received 33 votes in the British Film Institute's 2012 Sight & Sound polls, making it the 63rd greatest film of all time in the critics' poll and 67th in the directors' poll. In the earlier 2002 Sight & Sound polls the film ranked 12th among directors. In 2022 edition of Sight & Sound's Greatest films of all time list the film ranked 62nd in the director's poll. The Writers Guild of America ranked the film's screenplay (written by Charles Brackett & Billy Wilder and D.M. Marshman Jr.) the 7th greatest ever. In a 2015 poll by BBC Culture, film critics ranked Sunset Boulevard the 54th greatest American film of all time.\nAmerican Film Institute included the film on these lists:\n\n1998 \u2013 AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies \u2013 #12\n2005 \u2013 AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes:\n\"All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up.\" \u2013 #7\n\"I am big, it's the pictures that got small!\" \u2013 #24\n2005 \u2013 AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores \u2013 #16\n2007 \u2013 AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) \u2013 #16\n\nAftermath\nSunset Boulevard was the last collaboration between Wilder and Brackett. They parted amicably and did not publicly air any grievances for the rest of their lives. In later years, Brackett confided in screenwriter\/director Garson Kanin that he had not anticipated the split, or had ever understood exactly what happened or why. He described it as \"an unexpected blow\" from which he never recovered fully; when asked to respond to Brackett's comments, Wilder remained silent.\nThe two men briefly reunited in October 1951 to face charges that they had plagiarized Sunset Boulevard. Former Paramount accountant Stephanie Joan Carlson alleged that in 1947 she had submitted to Wilder and Brackett, at their request, manuscripts of stories, both fictional and based on fact, she had written about studio life. She claimed that one in particular, Past Performance, served as the basis for the Sunset script, and sued the screenwriters and Paramount for $100,000 in general damages, $250,000 in punitive damages, $700,000 based on the box office returns, and an additional $350,000 for good measure, for a total of $1,400,000. Carlson's suit was dismissed after two and a half years. In 1954, a similar suit was filed by playwright Edra Buckler, who claimed material she had written had been the screenplay's source. Her suit was dismissed the following year.\nBrackett's Hollywood career continued after his split with Wilder. He won an Academy Award for his screenplay for Titanic (1953), and wrote Niagara (1953), the breakthrough film for Marilyn Monroe as a dramatic actress. It was Wilder, however, who realized Monroe's comedic abilities in The Seven Year Itch and Some Like It Hot. Brackett's career waned by the end of the decade, though he did produce the Oscar-nominated film The King and I (1956). He received an Honorary Oscar for Lifetime Achievement in 1958.\nWilliam Holden began receiving more important parts and his career rose. He won the Best Actor Oscar for Stalag 17 (1953), also directed by Wilder, and by 1956 he was the top box-office attraction in the United States. Holden and Wilder also rejoined forces for Fedora (1978), another film critical of Hollywood.\nBefore the film was released, Nancy Olson had grown disenchanted with film as a career partly because the themes of Sunset Boulevard resonated with her, and also because she had become engaged to songwriter Alan Jay Lerner and decided to move to New York with him. Nevertheless, Olson's pairing with William Holden was considered a success, and she appeared opposite him in several films during the 1950s, although none of them repeated their earlier success; she returned to Hollywood to make several other films, including The Absent-Minded Professor (1961) and Son of Flubber (1963), in which she was paired with Fred MacMurray.\nSimilarly, Gloria Swanson was not able to leverage her own success in Sunset Boulevard. Although offered scripts, she felt that they all were poor imitations of Norma Desmond. Imagining a career that would eventually reduce her to playing \"a parody of a parody,\" she virtually retired from films.\nSunset Boulevard was shown again in New York City in 1960, and drew such a positive response that Paramount arranged for a limited re-release in theaters throughout the United States.\nFilms that discuss Sunset Boulevard in their screenplays or pay homage in scenes or dialogue include Soapdish (1991), The Player (1992), Gods and Monsters (1998), Mulholland Drive (2001), Inland Empire (2006) and Be Cool (2005). The ending of Cecil B. Demented (2000) is a parody of Sunset Boulevard's final scene.\n\nRestoration and home media\nBy the late 1990s, most Sunset Boulevard prints were in poor condition, and as the film was shot using cellulose nitrate filmstock, much of the original negative had perished. Paramount Studios, believing the film merited the effort of a complete restoration, mounted an expensive project to have it digitally restored. This restored version was released on DVD in 2002. In 2012, the film was digitally restored by Paramount Pictures for Blu-ray Disc debut. Frame-by-frame digital restoration by Prasad Corporation removed dirt, tears, scratches and other defects.\n\nMusical adaptations\nStapley and Hughes\nFrom around 1952 to 1956, Gloria Swanson herself worked with actor Richard Stapley (aka Richard Wyler) and cabaret singer\/pianist Dickson Hughes on an adaptation titled Boulevard! (at first Starring Norma Desmond). Stapley and Hughes first approached Swanson about appearing in a musical revue they had written, About Time (based on Time). Swanson stated that she would return to the stage only in a musical version of her comeback film. Within a week, Stapley and Dickson had written three songs which Swanson approved.\nIn this version, the romance between Gillis and Schaefer was allowed to blossom, and rather than shoot Gillis at the end, Norma gave the couple her blessing, sending them on their way to live \"happily ever after.\"\nAlthough Paramount gave verbal permission to proceed with the musical, there was no formal legal option. In the late 1950s, Paramount withdrew its consent, leading to the demise of the project.\nIn 1994, Dickson Hughes incorporated material from Boulevard! into a musical Swanson on Sunset, based on his and Stapley's experiences in writing Boulevard!.\nThis attempt is chronicled in the 2021 documentary Boulevard! A Hollywood Story.\n\nOther failed attempts\nStephen Sondheim briefly considered turning Sunset Boulevard into a musical until meeting Billy Wilder at a cocktail party, who told him that the film would be better adapted as an opera rather than a musical. Hal Prince later approached Sondheim to adapt the film as a musical with Angela Lansbury playing Norma Desmond.\nJohn Kander and Fred Ebb were also approached by Hal Prince to write a musical of Sunset Boulevard.\n\nMusical\nA musical adaptation with book and lyrics written by Don Black and Christopher Hampton, and music by Andrew Lloyd Webber was staged in 1993 in London, with Patti LuPone playing Norma Desmond. It closely followed the film story, retained much of the dialogue and attempted to present similar set designs. It reached Broadway in 1994, with Glenn Close playing Norma Desmond. The production staged 17 previews beginning November 1, 1994, and played 977 performances at the Minskoff Theatre from November 17, 1994, through March 22, 1997. It was named Best Musical at the 1995 Tony Awards.\nIn 2016, Close reprised the role in London's West End, followed by a 12-week run at the Palace Theater in New York City from February 2 to June 25, 2017.\nSunset Boulevard played one night at the Royal Albert Hall on December 3, 2021. The production was directed by Jordan Murphy and conducted by Alex Parker, and it starred Mazz Murray.\nIn 2023, Nicole Scherzinger revived the role of Norma Desmond in a 16-week run from September at London's Savoy Theatre, in a production directed by Jamie Lloyd. The production is scheduled to transfer to Broadway's St. James Theatre with an opening night planned for October 20, 2024.\nA film adaptation of the musical, with Close and Lloyd Webber producing, and Close playing Norma, is in development at Paramount Pictures, with Rob Ashford directing and Tom MacRae writing. Filming was originally set to begin in late 2019, but was delayed three times due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Paramount putting the project on hold in October 2021. In May 2024, Close revealed that the film is still moving forward, but with Ashford no longer attached as director.\n\nIn popular culture\nTelevision\nThe film was parodied on The Carol Burnett Show in a recurring sketch called \"Sunnyset Boulevard\" in which Carol Burnett played the insane \"Nora Desmond\" and Harvey Korman her servant Max.\nThe film has clearly influenced The Sixteen-Millimeter Shrine, which is the 1959 fourth episode of the first season of the original Twilight Zone. In it, Ida Lupino stars as Barbara Jean Trenton, an aging Hollywood film star who lives a secluded life in her mansion, reminiscing constantly about her past by watching her old films from the 1930s and planning an unrealistic comeback.\nThe Tiny Toon Adventures episode \"Sepulveda Boulevard\" is a parody of the film, with various characters trying to steal screenplay ideas from each other; when characters try to justify the theft with, \"Hey, this is Hollywood,\" someone replies, \"This is the VALLEY, bub!\"\nIn the episode of American Dad! entitled \"Star Trek\", the plot revolves around the downfall of stardom and pays tribute by replicating the opening scene of the movie. The plot of the episode \"A Star is Reborn\" is also based on the film.\nThe Archer season 7 finale and segue to the film noir Archer: Dreamland season 8 recreate the pool scene from the opening of the film.\nThe Season 11 premiere of Curb Your Enthusiasm, entitled \"The Five-Foot Fence\", begins with Larry David finding a home invader's corpse floating face-down in his pool.\nThe Twin Peaks character Gordon Cole is named after the Sunset Boulevard character. A scene from the film itself appears in Part 15 of Twin Peaks: The Return. In the scene, being viewed by Dale Cooper, the name \"Gordon Cole\" is spoken, which stirs Cooper's buried memory of his time in the FBI.\nThe 3rd Rock from the Sun episode \"Fifteen Minutes of Dick\" (season 2, ep. 23) features a spoof on the film, wherein Sally, suddenly famous, spirals into Norma-esque despair as her celebrity wanes.\nThe early episodes of Desperate Housewives (2004) have numerous allusions to Sunset Boulevard, including the use of a dead person as a narrator, and another character's fondness for Billy Wilder movies.\nIn the movie Hick, Luli (Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz) can be found in her room reciting the movie in the mirror. Moretz stated that she was the one who suggested the quote be implemented.\nIn the scene where Robin Williams first tries on his drag outfit in Mrs. Doubtfire, he quotes Swanson's famous line \"I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille\".\n\nLiterature\nSunset Boulevard is frequently referenced in the book The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside The Room, the Greatest Bad Movie Ever Made by Greg Sestero and Tom Bissell, which documents Sestero's relationship with director and actor Tommy Wiseau and the making of Wiseau's film The Room. Quotes from Sunset Boulevard are used as epigraphs for several of the book's chapters. In a 2017 interview, Sestero stated that \"I saw a lot of similarities with my story, especially when Tommy lived in a place that had a pool and wanted to make his own vanity project.\"\n\nPolitics\nDonald Trump has cited the film as one of his personal favorites, and screened it multiple times at the White House Family Theater during his presidency. The press subsequently brought up an analogy between Trump's Mar-a-Lago and Norma Desmond's Sunset Boulevard mansion.\n\nPopular music\nThe song \"Antarctica Starts Here\" by John Cale, from his 1973 album Paris 1919, describes a \"paranoid great movie queen\" that Cale said was inspired by the character of Norma Desmond.\nThe song \"Floating\" on the album Outskirts by Canadian country-rock band Blue Rodeo references the movie in its chorus line 'I feel like William Holden floating in a pool.' The album's liner notes explain the connection to the film.\nThe 1996 song Sunset Boulevard by the Spanish songwriter Javier \u00c1lvarez includes the verses Los a\u00f1os de papel te vuelven a cegar \/ Como a Norma Desmond en Sunset Boulevard (\"The paper years blind you again \/ as [they blinded] Norma Desmond in 'Sunset Boulevard'\".)\n\nProfessional wrestling\nThe \"Timeless\" gimmick, as portrayed by Australian wrestler Toni Storm in All Elite Wrestling in 2023 and 2024, is primarily based upon the character of Norma Desmond, with her \"butler\" \u2013 Canadian wrestler Dr. Luther \u2013 being based upon the character of Max von Mayerling. The storyline involving Storm also draws inspiration from the film All About Eve, with Storm's character also sharing traits with the character of Margo Channing, and English wrestler Mariah May portraying an Eve Harrington-esque foil to Storm.\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nSunset Boulevard at IMDb\nSunset Boulevard at AllMovie\nSunset Boulevard at the TCM Movie Database\nSunset Boulevard at the AFI Catalog of Feature Films\nSunset Boulevard at Rotten Tomatoes\nSunset Boulevard on Lux Radio Theater: September 17, 1951","206":"Sunset Boulevard is a 1950 American black comedy film noir directed by  Billy Wilder and co-written by Wilder and Charles Brackett. It is named after a major street that runs through Hollywood.\nThe film stars William Holden as Joe Gillis, a struggling screenwriter, and Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond, a former silent-film star who draws him into her deranged fantasy world, where she dreams of making a triumphant return to the screen. Erich von Stroheim plays Max von Mayerling, her devoted butler, and Nancy Olson, Jack Webb, Lloyd Gough, and Fred Clark appear in supporting roles. Director Cecil B. DeMille and gossip columnist Hedda Hopper play themselves, and the film includes cameo appearances by silent-film stars Buster Keaton, H. B. Warner, and Anna Q. Nilsson.\nPraised by many critics when first released, Sunset Boulevard was nominated for 11 Academy Awards (including nominations in all four acting categories) and won three. It is often ranked among the greatest movies ever made. As it was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the U.S. Library of Congress in 1989, Sunset Boulevard was included in the first group of films selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. In 1998, it was ranked number 12 on the American Film Institute's list of the 100 best American films of the 20th century. In 2007, it was 16th on their 10th Anniversary list.\n\nPlot\nAt a mansion on Sunset Boulevard, police officers and photographers discover the body of Joe Gillis floating face down in the swimming pool. In a flashback, Joe relates the events leading to his death.\nSix months earlier, Joe is a down-on-his-luck screenwriter trying to interest Paramount Pictures in a story he submitted. Script reader Betty Schaefer harshly critiques it, unaware that Joe is listening. Later, while fleeing from repo men seeking his car, Joe turns into the driveway of a seemingly deserted mansion inhabited by forgotten silent film star Norma Desmond. Learning that Joe is a writer, Norma asks his opinion of a script she has written for a film about Salome. She plans to play the role herself in her return to the screen. Joe finds her script abysmal, but flatters her into hiring him as a script doctor.\nJoe moves into Norma's mansion at her insistence, and sees that Norma refuses to believe that her fame has evaporated. Her butler Max secretly writes all of the fan mail that she receives in order to maintain the illusion. At her New Year's Eve party, Joe realizes that she has fallen in love with him. He tries to let her down gently, but Norma slaps him and retreats to her room, distraught. Joe visits his friend Artie Green and again meets Betty, who thinks a scene in one of Joe's scripts has potential. When he phones Max to have him pack his things, Max tells him Norma has cut her wrists with his razor. Joe then returns to Norma, and their relationship becomes sexual.\nNorma has Max deliver the edited Salome script to her former director Cecil B. DeMille at Paramount. She starts getting calls from Paramount executive Gordon Cole but refuses to speak to anyone except DeMille. Eventually, she has Max drive her and Joe to Paramount in her 1929 Isotta Fraschini. DeMille welcomes her affectionately and treats her with great respect, but tactfully evades her questions about the script. Max then learns that Cole only called her because he wants to rent her Isotta Fraschini for use in a film.\nPreparing for her imagined comeback, Norma undergoes rigorous beauty treatments. Joe secretly works nights in Betty's office, collaborating on an original screenplay. Max discovers his moonlighting, who then reveals that he was once a respected film director who discovered Norma, made her a star, and was her first husband. After she divorces him, he abandons his career to become her servant.\nNorma discovers a manuscript with Joe and Betty's names on it and phones Betty, insinuating that Joe is not the man he seems. Overhearing the call, Joe invites Betty to the mansion to see for herself. When she arrives, he pretends that he is satisfied being a gigolo so that she can be with Artie. However, after she tearfully leaves, he packs to return to his old newspaper job in Dayton, Ohio. He bluntly informs Norma that there will be no comeback, that Max writes all of her fan mail, and that she has been forgotten. He disregards Norma's threat to kill herself as she brandishes a gun; as he leaves the house, Norma shoots him three times, and he collapses into the pool.\nThe flashback ends and the film returns to the present day, with Norma about to be arrested for murder. The mansion is overrun with police and reporters with newsreel cameras, which she believes are film cameras. Max pretends to \"direct\" her, and the police play along. As the cameras roll, Norma descends the grand staircase for what she thinks is a close-up for DeMille. She stops and makes an impromptu speech about how happy she is to be making a film again, then walks towards the camera, before she gets arrested by the authorities.\n\nCast\nProduction\nBackground\nThe street known as Sunset Boulevard has been associated with Hollywood film production since 1911, when the town's first film studio, Nestor, opened there. The film workers lived modestly in the growing neighborhood, but during the 1920s, profits and salaries rose to unprecedented levels. With the advent of the star system, luxurious homes noted for their often incongruous grandeur were built in the area.\nAs a young man living in Berlin in the 1920s, Billy Wilder was interested in American culture, with much of his interest fueled by the country's films. In the late 1940s, many of the grand Hollywood houses remained, and Wilder, then a Los Angeles resident, found them to be a part of his everyday world. Many former stars from the silent era still lived in them, although most were no longer involved in the film business. Wilder wondered how they spent their time now that \"the parade had passed them by\" and began imagining the story of a star who had lost her celebrity and box-office appeal.\nThe character of Norma Desmond mirrors aspects of the twilight years of several real-life faded silent-film stars, such as the reclusive existences of Mary Pickford and Pola Negri and the mental disorders of Mae Murray, Valeska Surratt, Audrey Munson and Clara Bow. Dave Kehr has asserted that Norma Talmadge is \"the obvious if unacknowledged source of Norma Desmond, the grotesque, predatory silent movie queen\" of the film. The most common analysis of the character's name is that it is a combination of the names of silent film actress Mabel Normand and director William Desmond Taylor, a close friend of Normand's who was murdered in 1922 in a never-solved case sensationalized by the press.\n\nWriting\nCinematographer John Seitz stated that Wilder \"had wanted to do Evelyn Waugh's 1948 novel The Loved One, but couldn\u2019t obtain the rights.\" Waugh's story follows a failed screenwriter who lives with a silent film star and works in a cemetery. Gossip columnist Hedda Hopper, who plays herself in the movie, wrote that \"Billy Wilder \u2026 was crazy about Evelyn Waugh's book The Loved One, and the studio wanted to buy it.\" Regardless, the plans for this adaptation fell through. The original script that followed nevertheless contains similarities to the novel. At one point, Norma mistakes Joe for a funeral director and inquires about a coffin for herself and her deceased pet chimp.\nWilder and Brackett began working on a script in 1948, but the result did not completely satisfy them. In August 1948, D. M. Marshman Jr., formerly a writer for Life, was hired to help develop the storyline after Wilder and Brackett were impressed by a critique he provided of their film The Emperor Waltz (1948). In an effort to keep the full details of the story from Paramount Pictures and avoid the restrictive censorship of the Breen Code, they submitted the script a few pages at a time. The Breen Office insisted certain lines be rewritten, such as Gillis's \"I'm up that creek and I need a job,\" which became \"I'm over a barrel. I need a job.\" Paramount executives thought Wilder was adapting a story called A Can of Beans (which did not exist) and allowed him relative freedom to proceed as he saw fit. Only the first third of the script was written when filming began in early May 1949, and Wilder was unsure how the film would end.\n\nThe fusion of writer-director Billy Wilder's biting humor and the classic elements of film noir make for a strange kind of comedy, as well as a strange kind of film noir. There are no belly laughs here, but there are certainly strangled giggles: at the pet chimp's midnight funeral, at Joe's discomfited acquiescence to the role of gigolo; at Norma's Mack Sennett-style \"entertainments\" for her uneasy lover; and at the ritualized solemnity of Norma's \"waxworks\" card parties, which feature such former luminaries as Buster Keaton as Norma's has-been cronies.\nWilder preferred to leave analysis of his screenplays and films to others. When asked if Sunset Boulevard was a black comedy, he replied: \"No, just a picture\".\n\nCasting\nAccording to Brackett, Wilder and he never considered anyone except Gloria Swanson for the role of Norma Desmond. Wilder, however, recalled first wanting Mae West and Marlon Brando for the leads. West rejected the offer outright. West portrayed herself as a sex symbol through her senior years, and was offended that she should be asked to play a Hollywood has-been.\nThe filmmakers approached Greta Garbo, whom they had worked with previously on Ninotchka (1939), but she was not interested. Wilder contacted Pola Negri by telephone, but had a difficult time understanding her heavy Polish accent. He then reached out to Clara Bow, the famed \"It girl\" of the 1920s, but she declined citing that she had no interest in engaging in the film industry again due to how hard it was for her during the transition of sound films and that she'd prefer to remain in seclusion with her husband and sons while leaving her previous life behind her. They also offered the part of Norma Desmond to Norma Shearer, but she rejected the role due to both her retirement and distaste for the script. They were considering Fred MacMurray to play opposite her as Joe. Wilder and Brackett then visited Mary Pickford, but before even discussing the plot with her, Wilder realized she would consider a role involving an affair with a man half her age an insult, so they departed. They had considered pairing Montgomery Clift with her.\nAccording to Wilder, he asked George Cukor for advice, and he suggested Swanson, one of the most f\u00eated actresses of the silent-screen era, known for her beauty, talent, and extravagant lifestyle. In many ways, she resembled the Norma Desmond character, and like her, had been unable to make a smooth transition into talking pictures. The similarities ended there; Swanson made a handful of talking pictures. She accepted the end of her film career and, in the early 1930s, moved to New York City, where she worked in radio. In the mid-1940s, she worked in television and on the New York stage and had last appeared in the 1941 film Father Takes a Wife. Though Swanson was not seeking a movie comeback, she became intrigued when Wilder discussed the role with her.\nSwanson was glad for the opportunity to earn a greater salary than she had been making in television and on stage. However, she was chagrined at the notion of submitting to a screen test, saying she had \"made 20 films for Paramount. Why do they want me to audition?\" Her reaction was echoed in the screenplay when Norma Desmond declares, \"Without me there wouldn't be any Paramount studios.\" In her memoir, Swanson recalled asking Cukor if it was unreasonable to refuse the screen test. He replied that since Norma Desmond was the role for which she would be remembered, \"If they ask you to do ten screen tests, do ten screen tests, or I will personally shoot you.\" His enthusiasm convinced Swanson to participate, and she signed a contract for $50,000 (equivalent to $630,000 in 2023). In a 1975 interview, Wilder recalled Swanson's reaction with the observation, \"There was a lot of Norma in her, you know.\"\nWilder harks back to Swanson's silent film career when Norma shows Joe the film Queen Kelly, an earlier Gloria Swanson film directed by Erich von Stroheim, who himself portrays Norma's butler and former director and husband Max von Mayerling. Queen Kelly was not released in the United States for over 50 years after Swanson walked off the set.\nMontgomery Clift was signed to play Joe Gillis for $5,000 per week for a guaranteed twelve weeks, but withdrew just before the start of filming, claiming his role of a young man involved with an older woman was too close to the one he had played in The Heiress (1949), in which he felt he had been unconvincing. An infuriated Wilder responded, \"If he's any kind of actor, he could be convincing making love to any woman.\" Clift himself was having an affair with a woman 15 years his senior, the singer Libby Holman, which some have suggested was his real reason for withdrawing from the film.\nForced to consider the available Paramount contract players, Wilder and Brackett focused on William Holden, who had made an impressive debut a decade earlier in Golden Boy (1939). Following an appearance in Our Town (1940), he served in the military in World War II, and his return to the screen afterward had been moderately successful. Holden was enthusiastic about the script and eager to accept the role. He did not know at the time that his salary of $39,000 (equivalent to $490,000 in 2023) was much less than had been offered to Clift.\nFor the role of Betty Schaefer, Wilder wanted a newcomer who could project a wholesome and ordinary image to contrast with Swanson's flamboyant and obsessive Desmond. He chose Nancy Olson, who had recently been considered for the role of Delilah in Cecil B. DeMille's Samson and Delilah.\nDeMille, often credited as the person most responsible for making Swanson a star, plays himself, with his scenes filmed on the set of Samson and Delilah at Paramount Studios. He calls Norma \"young fella\", which had been his nickname for Swanson.\nNorma's friends who come to play bridge with her, referred to by Joe as \"the waxworks\", were Swanson's silent-era contemporaries Buster Keaton, Anna Q. Nilsson, and H. B. Warner, portraying themselves. Hedda Hopper also played herself, reporting on Norma Desmond's downfall in the film's final scenes.\n\nCinematography and design\nThe film's dark, shadowy black-and-white cinematography was the work of John F. Seitz. Wilder had worked with Seitz on several projects before, and trusted his judgment, allowing him to make his own decisions. Seitz recalled asking Wilder what he required for the pet chimpanzee's funeral scene, to which Wilder replied, \"you know, just your standard monkey funeral shot.\" For some interior shots, Seitz sprinkled dust in front of the camera before filming to suggest \"mustiness,\" a technique he had also used for Wilder's Double Indemnity (1944). The film had the option to be shot in color, but it was instead shot in black and white to be more reflective of the noir genre.\n\nWilder was adamant that the corpse of Joe Gillis be seen from the bottom of the pool, but creating the effect was difficult. The camera was placed inside a specially constructed box and lowered under water, but the result disappointed Wilder, who insisted on further experiments. The shot was finally achieved by placing a mirror on the bottom of the pool and filming Holden's reflection from above, with the distorted image of the police officers standing around the pool forming a backdrop.\nFilm historian Tom Stempel writes: \"In both Double Indemnity and Sunset Boulevard, Seitz does something that has always impressed me. Both are films noir, and he finesses the fact that both are set in the sunniest of locales, Los Angeles... he brings together the light and the dark in the same film without any seams showing... he brings together the realistic lighting of Joe Gillis out in the real world with the gothic look of Norma Desmond's mansion.\"\nEdith Head designed the costumes. Wilder, Head, and Swanson agreed that Norma Desmond would have kept somewhat up-to-date with fashion trends, so Head designed costumes closely resembling the Dior look of the mid-1940s. Embellishments were added to personalize them and reflect Norma Desmond's taste.\nSwanson recalled in her biography that the costumes were only \"a trifle outdated, a trifle exotic.\" Head later described her assignment as \"the most challenging of my career,\" and explained her approach with the comment, \"Because Norma Desmond was an actress who had become lost in her own imagination, I tried to make her look like she was always impersonating someone.\" Head later said she relied on Swanson's expertise because \"she was creating a past that she knew and I didn't.\" Head also designed the costumes for William Holden and the minor characters, but Wilder instructed von Stroheim and Nancy Olson to wear their own clothing.\nThe overstated decadence of Norma Desmond's home was created by set designer Hans Dreier, whose career extended back to the silent era. He had also been commissioned to complete the interior design for the homes of movie stars, including the house of Mae West. William Haines, an interior designer and former actor, later rebutted criticism of Dreier's set design with the observation, \"Bebe Daniels, Norma Shearer, and Pola Negri all had homes with ugly interiors like that.\"\nThe bed in the shape of a boat in which Norma Desmond slept had been owned by the dancer Gaby Deslys, who died in 1920. It had originally been bought by the Universal prop department at auction after Deslys's death. The bed appeared in The Phantom of the Opera (1925) starring Lon Chaney.\nWilder also made use of authentic locales. Joe's apartment is in the Alto Nido, a real apartment block in central Hollywood that was often home to struggling writers. It is located at 1851 Ivar Ave. and Franklin Ave. west of the Hollywood Freeway. The scenes of Gillis and Betty Schaefer on Paramount's back lot were filmed on the actual studio back lot, and the interior of Schwab's Drug Store was carefully recreated for several scenes. The exterior scenes of the Desmond house were filmed at a house on Wilshire Boulevard built during the 1920s by the millionaire William O. Jenkins. Jenkins and his family lived in it for only one year before then leaving it abandoned for more than a decade, which earned it the nickname \"Phantom House\". By 1949, it was owned by the former wife of J. Paul Getty. The house was later featured in Nicholas Ray's Rebel Without a Cause (1955). It was demolished by the Gettys in 1957 to make way for the construction of an office building.\nDuring filming, considerable publicity was given to the health-conscious Gloria Swanson's youthful appearance, which made her look the same age as Holden. Wilder insisted that the age difference between the characters be delineated, and instructed makeup supervisor Wally Westmore to make Swanson look older. Swanson argued that a woman of Norma Desmond's age, with her considerable wealth and devotion to self, would not necessarily look old, and suggested Holden be made up to appear younger. Wilder agreed, and Westmore was assigned this task, which allowed Swanson to portray Norma Desmond as more glamorous a figure than Wilder had originally imagined.\n\nScore\nFranz Waxman's musical score was the final element added to Sunset Boulevard. His theme for Norma was based on tango music, inspired by her having danced the tango with Rudolph Valentino. This style was contrasted with Joe's bebop theme. Waxman also used distorted arrangements of popular film-music styles from the 1920s and 1930s to suggest Norma Desmond's state of mind. The film's score was recorded for compact disc by the Scottish Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Joel McNeely, and released in 2002. The surviving parts of the original score were released in 2010.\n\nOriginal release and responses\nPreviews and revision\nWilder and Brackett, nervous about a major screening in Hollywood, held a preview in Evanston, Illinois, in late 1949. The original edit opened with a scene inside a morgue, with the assembled corpses discussing how they came to be there. The story began with the corpse of Joe Gillis recounting his murder to the others. The audience reacted with laughter and seemed unsure whether to view the rest of the film as drama or comedy. After a similar reaction during its second screening in Poughkeepsie, New York, and a third in Great Neck, the morgue opening was replaced by a shorter poolside opening, using footage filmed on January 5, 1950.\nIn Hollywood, Paramount arranged a private screening for the various studio heads and specially invited guests. After viewing the film, Barbara Stanwyck knelt to kiss the hem of Gloria Swanson's skirt. Swanson later remembered looking for Mary Pickford, only to be told, \"She can't show herself, Gloria. She's too overcome. We all are.\" Louis B. Mayer berated Wilder before the crowd of celebrities, saying, \"You have disgraced the industry that made and fed you! You should be tarred and feathered and run out of Hollywood!\" Upon hearing of Mayer's slight, Wilder strode up to the mogul and retorted with a vulgarity that one biographer said was allegedly because Mayer, who was Jewish, suggested that Wilder, who was also Jewish, would be better off being sent back to Germany, an extraordinary sentiment so soon after the war and the Holocaust, in which Wilder's family perished. In 2020 Olson recounted that friends who had attended the screening told her that Wilder had simply told Mayer \"Go fuck yourself.\"\nThe few other criticisms were not so venomous. According to one often-told but later discredited anecdote, actress Mae Murray, a contemporary of Swanson, was offended by the film and commented, \"None of us floozies was that nuts.\"\n\nPremiere and box-office receipts\nSunset Boulevard had its official world premiere at Radio City Music Hall on August 10, 1950. After a seven-week run, Variety magazine reported the film had grossed \"around $1,020,000\", ($12,917,178 in 2023 dollars ) making it one of that theater's most successful pictures. Variety also noted that, while it was \"breaking records in major cities, it is doing below average in ... the sticks.\" To promote the film, Gloria Swanson traveled by train throughout the United States, visiting 33 cities in a few months. The publicity helped attract people to the cinemas, but in many areas away from major cities it was considered less than a hit.\nThe film earned an estimated $2,350,000 at the U.S. box office in 1950 ($29,760,166 in 2023 dollars ).\n\nCritical response\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 98% of critics gave the film a positive review based on 112 reviews, with an average rating of 9.5\/10. The critical consensus states: \"Arguably the greatest movie about Hollywood, Billy Wilder's masterpiece Sunset Boulevard is a tremendously entertaining combination of noir, black comedy, and character study.\"\n\nContemporary\nSunset Boulevard attracted a range of positive reviews from critics. Time described it as a story of \"Hollywood at its worst told by Hollywood at its best\", while Boxoffice Review wrote \"the picture will keep spectators spellbound.\" James Agee, writing for Sight & Sound, praised the film and said Wilder and Brackett were \"beautifully equipped to do the cold, exact, adroit, sardonic job they have done.\" Good Housekeeping described Swanson as a \"great lady [who] spans another decade with her magic,\" while Look praised her \"brilliant and haunting performance.\"\nSome critics accurately foresaw the film's lasting appeal. The Hollywood Reporter wrote that future generations would \"set themselves the task of analyzing the durability and greatness\" of the film, while Commonweal said that in the future \"the Library of Congress will be glad to have in its archives a print of Sunset Boulevard.\"\nIn a rare negative review of the film, The New Yorker deemed it \"a pretentious slice of Roquefort\" containing only \"the germ of a good idea\". Despite praising it as a \"great motion picture\" with \"memorable\" acting, Thomas M. Pryor wrote in The New York Times that the use of the dead Joe Gillis as narrator was a plot device \"completely unworthy of Brackett and Wilder\".\n\nRetrospective\nIn 1999, Roger Ebert described Swanson as giving \"one of the all time greatest [acting] performances\", but singled out von Stroheim's performance as \"hold[ing] the film together\". He included it in his Great Movies list, calling it \"the best drama ever made about the movies because it sees through the illusions.\" Pauline Kael described the film as \"almost too clever, but at its best in its cleverness\", and also wrote that it was common to \"hear Billy Wilder called the world's greatest director.\" When Wilder died in 2002, obituaries singled out Sunset Boulevard for comment, describing it as one of his most significant works, along with Double Indemnity and Some Like It Hot.\nFilm writer Richard Corliss describes Sunset Boulevard as \"the definitive Hollywood horror movie\", noting that almost everything in the script is \"ghoulish\". He remarks that the story is narrated by a dead man whom Norma Desmond first mistakes for an undertaker, while most of the film takes place \"in an old, dark house that only opens its doors to the living dead\". He compares von Stroheim's character Max with the concealed Erik, the central character in The Phantom of the Opera, and Norma Desmond with Dracula, noting that, as she seduces Joe Gillis, the camera tactfully withdraws with \"the traditional directorial attitude taken towards Dracula's jugular seductions\". He writes that the narrative contains an excess of \"cheap sarcasm\", but ultimately considers it a valuable part of Joe's characterization as a hack writer. David Thomson notes the irony of having Gillis tell the story: \"The man who can't dream up a viable story line becomes the best pitch he'll ever hear. He is the story and it is Billy Wilder's sour valedictory to let the ghost of Gillis tell the story, facedown in the gelid swimming pool exactly the Hollywood reward that Joe gets only in his dreams. And so this breathtaking portrait of Hollywood failure is wrapped up in rueful, ruined success.\"\n\nAwards and nominations\nOf the various films that have attracted Academy Award nominations in all four acting categories, Sunset Boulevard is one of only three not to win in any category, the others being My Man Godfrey (1936) and American Hustle (2013). At the time its eleven Oscar nominations were exceeded only by the fourteen received by All About Eve, which won six awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. Many critics predicted that the Best Actress award would be given to Gloria Swanson or Bette Davis for All About Eve and were surprised that the recipient was newcomer Judy Holliday for Born Yesterday. Bette Davis believed that her and Swanson's comparable characters effectively \"cancelled each other out\", allowing Holliday to win. Swanson recalled the press's reaction following Holliday's win: \"It slowly dawned on me that they were asking for a larger-than-life scene, or better still, a mad scene. More accurately, they were trying to flush out Norma Desmond.\"\nSunset Boulevard was dramatized as an hour-long radio play on the September 17, 1951, broadcast of Lux Radio Theater with Gloria Swanson and William Holden in their original film roles.\n\nRecognition since 1989\nIn 1989, the film was among the first group of 25 deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. The Village Voice ranked the film at No. 43 in its Top 250 \"Best Films of the Century\" list in 1999, based on a poll of critics. The film was included in \"The New York Times Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made\" in 2002. In January 2002, the film was voted at No. 87 on the list of the \"Top 100 Essential Films of All Time\" by the National Society of Film Critics. Sunset Boulevard received 33 votes in the British Film Institute's 2012 Sight & Sound polls, making it the 63rd greatest film of all time in the critics' poll and 67th in the directors' poll. In the earlier 2002 Sight & Sound polls the film ranked 12th among directors. In 2022 edition of Sight & Sound's Greatest films of all time list the film ranked 62nd in the director's poll. The Writers Guild of America ranked the film's screenplay (written by Charles Brackett & Billy Wilder and D.M. Marshman Jr.) the 7th greatest ever. In a 2015 poll by BBC Culture, film critics ranked Sunset Boulevard the 54th greatest American film of all time.\nAmerican Film Institute included the film on these lists:\n\n1998 \u2013 AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies \u2013 #12\n2005 \u2013 AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes:\n\"All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up.\" \u2013 #7\n\"I am big, it's the pictures that got small!\" \u2013 #24\n2005 \u2013 AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores \u2013 #16\n2007 \u2013 AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) \u2013 #16\n\nAftermath\nSunset Boulevard was the last collaboration between Wilder and Brackett. They parted amicably and did not publicly air any grievances for the rest of their lives. In later years, Brackett confided in screenwriter\/director Garson Kanin that he had not anticipated the split, or had ever understood exactly what happened or why. He described it as \"an unexpected blow\" from which he never recovered fully; when asked to respond to Brackett's comments, Wilder remained silent.\nThe two men briefly reunited in October 1951 to face charges that they had plagiarized Sunset Boulevard. Former Paramount accountant Stephanie Joan Carlson alleged that in 1947 she had submitted to Wilder and Brackett, at their request, manuscripts of stories, both fictional and based on fact, she had written about studio life. She claimed that one in particular, Past Performance, served as the basis for the Sunset script, and sued the screenwriters and Paramount for $100,000 in general damages, $250,000 in punitive damages, $700,000 based on the box office returns, and an additional $350,000 for good measure, for a total of $1,400,000. Carlson's suit was dismissed after two and a half years. In 1954, a similar suit was filed by playwright Edra Buckler, who claimed material she had written had been the screenplay's source. Her suit was dismissed the following year.\nBrackett's Hollywood career continued after his split with Wilder. He won an Academy Award for his screenplay for Titanic (1953), and wrote Niagara (1953), the breakthrough film for Marilyn Monroe as a dramatic actress. It was Wilder, however, who realized Monroe's comedic abilities in The Seven Year Itch and Some Like It Hot. Brackett's career waned by the end of the decade, though he did produce the Oscar-nominated film The King and I (1956). He received an Honorary Oscar for Lifetime Achievement in 1958.\nWilliam Holden began receiving more important parts and his career rose. He won the Best Actor Oscar for Stalag 17 (1953), also directed by Wilder, and by 1956 he was the top box-office attraction in the United States. Holden and Wilder also rejoined forces for Fedora (1978), another film critical of Hollywood.\nBefore the film was released, Nancy Olson had grown disenchanted with film as a career partly because the themes of Sunset Boulevard resonated with her, and also because she had become engaged to songwriter Alan Jay Lerner and decided to move to New York with him. Nevertheless, Olson's pairing with William Holden was considered a success, and she appeared opposite him in several films during the 1950s, although none of them repeated their earlier success; she returned to Hollywood to make several other films, including The Absent-Minded Professor (1961) and Son of Flubber (1963), in which she was paired with Fred MacMurray.\nSimilarly, Gloria Swanson was not able to leverage her own success in Sunset Boulevard. Although offered scripts, she felt that they all were poor imitations of Norma Desmond. Imagining a career that would eventually reduce her to playing \"a parody of a parody,\" she virtually retired from films.\nSunset Boulevard was shown again in New York City in 1960, and drew such a positive response that Paramount arranged for a limited re-release in theaters throughout the United States.\nFilms that discuss Sunset Boulevard in their screenplays or pay homage in scenes or dialogue include Soapdish (1991), The Player (1992), Gods and Monsters (1998), Mulholland Drive (2001), Inland Empire (2006) and Be Cool (2005). The ending of Cecil B. Demented (2000) is a parody of Sunset Boulevard's final scene.\n\nRestoration and home media\nBy the late 1990s, most Sunset Boulevard prints were in poor condition, and as the film was shot using cellulose nitrate filmstock, much of the original negative had perished. Paramount Studios, believing the film merited the effort of a complete restoration, mounted an expensive project to have it digitally restored. This restored version was released on DVD in 2002. In 2012, the film was digitally restored by Paramount Pictures for Blu-ray Disc debut. Frame-by-frame digital restoration by Prasad Corporation removed dirt, tears, scratches and other defects.\n\nMusical adaptations\nStapley and Hughes\nFrom around 1952 to 1956, Gloria Swanson herself worked with actor Richard Stapley (aka Richard Wyler) and cabaret singer\/pianist Dickson Hughes on an adaptation titled Boulevard! (at first Starring Norma Desmond). Stapley and Hughes first approached Swanson about appearing in a musical revue they had written, About Time (based on Time). Swanson stated that she would return to the stage only in a musical version of her comeback film. Within a week, Stapley and Dickson had written three songs which Swanson approved.\nIn this version, the romance between Gillis and Schaefer was allowed to blossom, and rather than shoot Gillis at the end, Norma gave the couple her blessing, sending them on their way to live \"happily ever after.\"\nAlthough Paramount gave verbal permission to proceed with the musical, there was no formal legal option. In the late 1950s, Paramount withdrew its consent, leading to the demise of the project.\nIn 1994, Dickson Hughes incorporated material from Boulevard! into a musical Swanson on Sunset, based on his and Stapley's experiences in writing Boulevard!.\nThis attempt is chronicled in the 2021 documentary Boulevard! A Hollywood Story.\n\nOther failed attempts\nStephen Sondheim briefly considered turning Sunset Boulevard into a musical until meeting Billy Wilder at a cocktail party, who told him that the film would be better adapted as an opera rather than a musical. Hal Prince later approached Sondheim to adapt the film as a musical with Angela Lansbury playing Norma Desmond.\nJohn Kander and Fred Ebb were also approached by Hal Prince to write a musical of Sunset Boulevard.\n\nMusical\nA musical adaptation with book and lyrics written by Don Black and Christopher Hampton, and music by Andrew Lloyd Webber was staged in 1993 in London, with Patti LuPone playing Norma Desmond. It closely followed the film story, retained much of the dialogue and attempted to present similar set designs. It reached Broadway in 1994, with Glenn Close playing Norma Desmond. The production staged 17 previews beginning November 1, 1994, and played 977 performances at the Minskoff Theatre from November 17, 1994, through March 22, 1997. It was named Best Musical at the 1995 Tony Awards.\nIn 2016, Close reprised the role in London's West End, followed by a 12-week run at the Palace Theater in New York City from February 2 to June 25, 2017.\nSunset Boulevard played one night at the Royal Albert Hall on December 3, 2021. The production was directed by Jordan Murphy and conducted by Alex Parker, and it starred Mazz Murray.\nIn 2023, Nicole Scherzinger revived the role of Norma Desmond in a 16-week run from September at London's Savoy Theatre, in a production directed by Jamie Lloyd. The production is scheduled to transfer to Broadway's St. James Theatre with an opening night planned for October 20, 2024.\nA film adaptation of the musical, with Close and Lloyd Webber producing, and Close playing Norma, is in development at Paramount Pictures, with Rob Ashford directing and Tom MacRae writing. Filming was originally set to begin in late 2019, but was delayed three times due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Paramount putting the project on hold in October 2021. In May 2024, Close revealed that the film is still moving forward, but with Ashford no longer attached as director.\n\nIn popular culture\nTelevision\nThe film was parodied on The Carol Burnett Show in a recurring sketch called \"Sunnyset Boulevard\" in which Carol Burnett played the insane \"Nora Desmond\" and Harvey Korman her servant Max.\nThe film has clearly influenced The Sixteen-Millimeter Shrine, which is the 1959 fourth episode of the first season of the original Twilight Zone. In it, Ida Lupino stars as Barbara Jean Trenton, an aging Hollywood film star who lives a secluded life in her mansion, reminiscing constantly about her past by watching her old films from the 1930s and planning an unrealistic comeback.\nThe Tiny Toon Adventures episode \"Sepulveda Boulevard\" is a parody of the film, with various characters trying to steal screenplay ideas from each other; when characters try to justify the theft with, \"Hey, this is Hollywood,\" someone replies, \"This is the VALLEY, bub!\"\nIn the episode of American Dad! entitled \"Star Trek\", the plot revolves around the downfall of stardom and pays tribute by replicating the opening scene of the movie. The plot of the episode \"A Star is Reborn\" is also based on the film.\nThe Archer season 7 finale and segue to the film noir Archer: Dreamland season 8 recreate the pool scene from the opening of the film.\nThe Season 11 premiere of Curb Your Enthusiasm, entitled \"The Five-Foot Fence\", begins with Larry David finding a home invader's corpse floating face-down in his pool.\nThe Twin Peaks character Gordon Cole is named after the Sunset Boulevard character. A scene from the film itself appears in Part 15 of Twin Peaks: The Return. In the scene, being viewed by Dale Cooper, the name \"Gordon Cole\" is spoken, which stirs Cooper's buried memory of his time in the FBI.\nThe 3rd Rock from the Sun episode \"Fifteen Minutes of Dick\" (season 2, ep. 23) features a spoof on the film, wherein Sally, suddenly famous, spirals into Norma-esque despair as her celebrity wanes.\nThe early episodes of Desperate Housewives (2004) have numerous allusions to Sunset Boulevard, including the use of a dead person as a narrator, and another character's fondness for Billy Wilder movies.\nIn the movie Hick, Luli (Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz) can be found in her room reciting the movie in the mirror. Moretz stated that she was the one who suggested the quote be implemented.\nIn the scene where Robin Williams first tries on his drag outfit in Mrs. Doubtfire, he quotes Swanson's famous line \"I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille\".\n\nLiterature\nSunset Boulevard is frequently referenced in the book The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside The Room, the Greatest Bad Movie Ever Made by Greg Sestero and Tom Bissell, which documents Sestero's relationship with director and actor Tommy Wiseau and the making of Wiseau's film The Room. Quotes from Sunset Boulevard are used as epigraphs for several of the book's chapters. In a 2017 interview, Sestero stated that \"I saw a lot of similarities with my story, especially when Tommy lived in a place that had a pool and wanted to make his own vanity project.\"\n\nPolitics\nDonald Trump has cited the film as one of his personal favorites, and screened it multiple times at the White House Family Theater during his presidency. The press subsequently brought up an analogy between Trump's Mar-a-Lago and Norma Desmond's Sunset Boulevard mansion.\n\nPopular music\nThe song \"Antarctica Starts Here\" by John Cale, from his 1973 album Paris 1919, describes a \"paranoid great movie queen\" that Cale said was inspired by the character of Norma Desmond.\nThe song \"Floating\" on the album Outskirts by Canadian country-rock band Blue Rodeo references the movie in its chorus line 'I feel like William Holden floating in a pool.' The album's liner notes explain the connection to the film.\nThe 1996 song Sunset Boulevard by the Spanish songwriter Javier \u00c1lvarez includes the verses Los a\u00f1os de papel te vuelven a cegar \/ Como a Norma Desmond en Sunset Boulevard (\"The paper years blind you again \/ as [they blinded] Norma Desmond in 'Sunset Boulevard'\".)\n\nProfessional wrestling\nThe \"Timeless\" gimmick, as portrayed by Australian wrestler Toni Storm in All Elite Wrestling in 2023 and 2024, is primarily based upon the character of Norma Desmond, with her \"butler\" \u2013 Canadian wrestler Dr. Luther \u2013 being based upon the character of Max von Mayerling. The storyline involving Storm also draws inspiration from the film All About Eve, with Storm's character also sharing traits with the character of Margo Channing, and English wrestler Mariah May portraying an Eve Harrington-esque foil to Storm.\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nSunset Boulevard at IMDb\nSunset Boulevard at AllMovie\nSunset Boulevard at the TCM Movie Database\nSunset Boulevard at the AFI Catalog of Feature Films\nSunset Boulevard at Rotten Tomatoes\nSunset Boulevard on Lux Radio Theater: September 17, 1951","207":"Sunland Boulevard is a major thoroughfare in the Crescenta and San Fernando Valleys.\n\nGeography\nSunland Boulevard splits off of Foothill Boulevard in the Sunland area of the Crescenta Valley.

Established in 1912, it continues today as Hollywood's largest independent studio and an active facility for television and film production on its twelve soundstages.\n\nHistory\nThe Poverty Row area of Hollywood, bounded by Sunset Boulevard on the North, Gower Street on the West, and Beachwood Drive on the East, was a collection of small warehouses and offices where independent film makers gathered to buy \"short ends\" of film from the major studios, in order to create their \"great American dreams\". In 1922, Harry Cohn of Cohn-Brandt-Cohn (CBC) Film Sales Corporation rented 6070 Sunset Blvd in Poverty Row. Following success and a move into feature films, CBC was renamed Columbia Pictures, and in 1926 acquired a Gower Street property with stages previously used by California Studios. In 1928, Columbia's official address became 1438 Gower Street and that year they bought the last piece of land of the old Gower Ranch at 1400 N Gower Street.\nThe Sunset Gower Studios lot, the home of such Columbia classics as Frank Capra's It Happened One Night in 1934, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington in 1939, the Three Stooges shorts, Funny Girl and The Caine Mutiny, has continued to host productions of top new films such as The Good Shepherd and The Good German. Television programs which have occupied several sound stages most notably include current series Scandal and How to Get Away with Murder and ended series Heroes, Dexter, NewsRadio, The Amanda Show, Deal or No Deal, Saved by the Bell, Hip Hop Harry, City Guys, Six Feet Under, JAG, Married... with Children, Soap, That's So Raven, Moesha, The Parkers, The Donna Reed Show, Father Knows Best, Hazel, I Dream of Jeannie, Bewitched, The Monkees, the first two seasons of The Golden Girls, the final three seasons of The Facts of Life, and the final two seasons of Silver Spoons.\nHarry Cohn died in 1958 at the age of 66. His memorial service was held on stages 12 and 14 at the studios (there is no stage 13).\nWithout the guidance of the Cohn Brothers, Columbia Pictures Corporation was not the profit-making company it once was. Between 1970 and 1972, Columbia moved from the 14-acre (57,000 m2) lot and joined forces with Warner Bros. in Burbank to what would later be called The Burbank Studios, then subsequently later moved to the Sony Pictures Studios (formerly MGM and Lorimar Studio) in Culver City. Its \"back lot\" on Hollywood Way in Burbank, where the Columbia westerns were made, became the property of Warner Bros.\nColumbia Pictures Corporation, renamed \"Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc.\" after merging with its television subsidiary Screen Gems (now Sony Pictures Television) in 1968, Columbia Pictures Industries relocated to the above mentioned Warner Brother-The Burbank Studios.  A large list of successful films were produced during this time, and in 1982, Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. was sold to The Coca-Cola Company for $750 million.\nDespite the merger, the Sunset and Gower studios provided the soundstages for popular television shows like Bewitched and I Dream of Jeannie. In 1976, the property was purchased by the Pick Vanoff Company for $6.2 million. The name was changed to \"Sunset Gower Studios\" and the lot became a rental facility for independent film companies. It was also used in the seventies as a music rehearsal facility catering to musicians such as Elton John, Fleetwood Mac, Eagles, Led Zeppelin, Ringo Starr, Frank Zappa, and Olivia Newton-John. For a time, stages 12 and 14 became indoor tennis courts.\nIn November 2004, Sunset Gower Studios was purchased by GI Partners for an estimated $105 million, and in 2006 began construction on a six-story building for Technicolor SA.\nIn August 2007, Sunset Gower Studios was bought by Hudson Capital. The Technicolor building opened its doors in 2008.  Since 2007, the studio has been undergoing both interior and exterior improvements on the lot.  Sunset Gower Studios is now working closely with its sister company Sunset Bronson Studios, located just a couple of blocks east on the site of the original Warner Bros. lot (1923\u201337), formerly owned by Tribune Broadcasting, and Sunset Las Palmas Studios, formerly the Hollywood Center Studios until 2017.\n\nExpansion project\nIn 2017, developer Hudson Pacific Properties submitted plans providing details of its new vision for Hollywood's landmark Sunset Gower Studios. The firm plans to demolish approximately 160,600 square feet (14,920 m2) of existing buildings at 6050 W on the 16-acre (6.5 ha) site. Sunset Boulevard adding storage area of 628,000 square feet (58,300 m2).\n\nReferences\nPorter, Gerald (March 6, 2007). \"Hollywood's Legendary Sunset Gower Studios Is Reborn: Multi-Million Dollar Remodeling and New Construction Underway\".

It was home to the Sunset Junction Street Fair from 1980 through 2010. It is in the southwestern part of the district along Sunset Boulevard.\n\nThe name refers to the street junction of Sunset Boulevard and Santa Monica Boulevard, two of the largest streets in Los Angeles, both of which travel from Sunset Junction to the Pacific Ocean. For most of their distance, the streets run parallel, but join here where they intersect Sanborn Avenue and where Santa Monica Blvd ends.\n\nHistory\nOriginally the junction was formed by the branching of two interurban railway lines and was known as Sanborn or Hollywood Junction. In 1895, the Pasadena and Pacific Railway Company built an interurban rail line from downtown Los Angeles to Santa Monica, whose route ran along Sunset Boulevard as far as Sanborn Avenue, where it turned west along the present alignment of Santa Monica Boulevard. In 1905, the Los Angeles Pacific Railway, successor to the Pasadena and Pacific, built a new branch northwest along Sunset Boulevard from Sanborn Avenue as a shortcut to its existing line on Hollywood Boulevard, forming the junction that is still reflected in the existing street configuration.  The Los Angeles Pacific Company was one of the eight rail companies merged in 1911 to form the Pacific Electric Railway. Rail service ceased on the two lines in 1954 and 1953, respectively.\nSunset  Junction is the site of one of the first actions in the nation against police activity in gay bars, the Black Cat Tavern protest, which began on February 11, 1967, almost two and a half years before the more famous protest at the Stonewall Inn in New York's Greenwich Village. The event is named for the Black Cat Tavern, formerly at 3909 Sunset Blvd between Sanborn and Hyperion Avenues, a location that had been a gay bar periodically since the 1940s. Organized in response to a police raid on the Black Cat on New Year's Eve 1966, in which several people were hurt, the protest was planned  to coincide with similar actions at African-American, Latino and \u201chippie\u201d establishments  around the city, which were also regularly patrolled.  Of these, the protest at the Black Cat was most successful, with over 200 people marching without any violent confrontation.  The Black Cat protest continued for several days but did not attract the media attention that the protests at the Stonewall Inn later did.\nFor many years Silver Lake housed a small, quiet gay and lesbian population, but in the 1970s a combination of affordable housing, a bohemian ambiance and promotion by gay real estate agents caused the gay and lesbian population to swell to more than 20% of the neighborhood total.\nIn 1979, an early literary gay and lesbian bookstores, A Different Light, was founded at 4014 Santa Monica Boulevard. The store functioned as a focal point for the community and was the site of readings by noted authors, including  Christopher Isherwood, Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs and Larry Kramer. Subsequently, additional branches were opened in West Hollywood (1990), San Francisco, and Greenwich Village in Manhattan.  The original store closed in 1992, as have the branches in Greenwich Village, West Hollywood, and San Francisco.\nTensions in the 1970s between the growing gay and lesbian population and working-class Latino families in the Silver Lake neighborhood led the integrated lesbian and gay Sunset Junction Neighborhood Alliance to organize the first Sunset Junction Street Fair in 1980.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nCurbed LA: Sunset Junction posts","210":"Sunset Boulevard is a musical with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber, and lyrics and libretto by Don Black and Christopher Hampton. It is based on the 1950 film of the same title.\nThe plot revolves around Norma Desmond, a faded star of the silent screen era, living in the past in her decaying mansion on the fabled Los Angeles street. When young screenwriter Joe Gillis accidentally crosses her path, she sees in him an opportunity to make her return to the big screen, with romance and tragedy to follow.\nOpening first in London in 1993, the musical has had several long runs internationally and enjoyed extensive tours. However, it has been the subject of several legal battles and ultimately lost money due to its extraordinary running costs.\n\nBackground\nFrom approximately 1952 to 1956, Gloria Swanson worked with actor Richard Stapley (aka Richard Wyler) and cabaret singer and pianist Dickson Hughes on a musical adaptation originally entitled Starring Norma Desmond, then Boulevard!. It ended on a happier note than the film, with Norma allowing Joe to leave and pursue a happy ending with Betty. Rights holder Paramount Pictures originally had given Swanson verbal permission to proceed with the musical, but there had been no formal legal arrangement. On 20 February 1957, Paramount executive Russell Holman wrote to Swanson asking her to cease work on the project because \"it would be damaging for the property to be offered to the entertainment public in another form as a stage musical.\" In 1994, Hughes incorporated material from the production into Swanson on Sunset, based on his and Stapley's experiences in writing Boulevard!. A recording of the entire score, which had been housed in the Gloria Swanson archives at the University of Texas, was released on CD in 2008.\nIn the early 1960s, Stephen Sondheim outlined a musical stage adaptation and went so far as to compose the first scene with librettist Burt Shevelove. A chance encounter with Billy Wilder at a cocktail party gave Sondheim the opportunity to introduce himself and ask the original film's co-screenwriter and director his opinion of the project (which was to star Jeanette MacDonald). \"You can't write a musical about Sunset Boulevard,\" Wilder responded, \"it has to be an opera. After all, it's about a dethroned queen.\" Sondheim immediately aborted his plans. A few years later, when he was invited by Hal Prince to write the score for a film remake starring Angela Lansbury as a fading musical comedian rather than a silent film star, Sondheim declined, citing his conversation with Wilder.\nWhen Lloyd Webber saw the film in the early 1970s, he was inspired to write what he pictured as the title song for a theatrical adaptation, fragments of which he instead incorporated into Gumshoe. In 1976, after a conversation with Hal Prince, who had the theatrical rights to Sunset, Lloyd Webber wrote \"an idea for the moment when Norma Desmond returns to Paramount Studios\"; Lloyd Webber did no further work on the play until after 1989's Aspects of Love. At that point, Lloyd Webber \"felt it was the subject [he] had to compose next\", though by February 1990 he had announced plans to turn Really Useful Group private so he could \"make movies rather than musicals.\"\nIn 1991, Lloyd Webber asked Amy Powers, a lawyer from New York with hardly any professional lyric-writing experience, to write the lyrics for Sunset Boulevard. Don Black was later brought in to work with Powers; the two wrote the version that was performed in 1991 at Lloyd Webber's Sydmonton Festival.  This original version starred Ria Jones as Norma and Michael Ball as Joe Gillis, but it was still in the experimental stage and not ready for potential producers. A revised version, written by Black and Christopher Hampton had a complete performance at the 1992 Sydmonton Festival, now with Patti LuPone playing Norma and Kevin Anderson as Joe Gillis. This \"met with great success\". Lloyd Webber borrowed several of the tunes from his 1986 mini-musical Cricket, written with Tim Rice, which had been performed at Windsor Castle and later at the 1986 Sydmonton Festival.\n\nSynopsis\nAct I\nThe place: A mansion on Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, 5 a.m. A homicide has been reported. Joe Gillis sets the scene (\"Prologue\"), noting that \"an old-time movie star is involved \/ Maybe the biggest star of all\", and that, if you want to know the \"real facts\", \"you've come to the right party.\"\nFlashback to... Hollywood, 1949 \u2013 where a down-on-his-luck screenwriter, Joe Gillis, is trying to hustle up some work at Paramount Studios (\"Let's Have Lunch\"). His appointment with a producer goes poorly when the executive rejects both Joe's proposed script and a loan to bring his car payments up to date. Joe does, however, meet Betty Schaefer, a pretty, young script editor who suggests they collaborate to rework one of his earlier screenplays (\"Every Movie's a Circus\"). As they chat, car repossession agents spot Joe, who quickly escapes.\nDuring the ensuing chase, Joe evades his pursuers by pulling in to the garage of a palatial but dilapidated mansion on Sunset Boulevard. Beckoned inside the house, Joe encounters Norma Desmond (\"Surrender\"), a star actress of the silent-film era. Taken aback, Joe comments, \"You used to be in pictures; you used to be big,\" to which Norma retorts, \"I am big \u2013 it's the pictures that got small!\" (\"With One Look\")\nThe gloomy estate is inhabited only by Norma and Max von Mayerling, her loyal butler and chauffeur. Although decades past her prime and mostly forgotten by the public, Norma is convinced she is as beautiful and popular as ever. Max perpetuates this illusion by shielding her from the realities of life out of the limelight and by writing her letters purportedly from still-devoted fans. Norma informs Joe that she plans to make her comeback with Salome, a script she has written for Cecil B. DeMille to direct with her in the starring role as the teenage biblical temptress (\"Salome\"). Dubious but sensing opportunity, Joe accepts her offer to work on editing the script. Norma insists that Joe stay in her home while they collaborate on Salome (\"The Greatest Star of All\").\nJoe immediately realizes the script is incoherent, but because Norma won't allow a major rewrite, the revision drags on for months. During this time Joe is virtually imprisoned within the house, but he does break away to fulfill his commitment to Betty. Their working relationship blossoms into a romance that has her reconsidering her engagement to Joe's best friend, Artie Green (\"Girl Meets Boy\").\nBlind to Joe's opportunism, Norma lavishes him with gifts that include a wardrobe makeover and he becomes her kept man (\"The Lady's Paying\"). She declares her love for him and turns quite possessive (\"The Perfect Year\"); when he leaves her to attend Artie's New Year's Eve party (\"This Time Next Year\"), she is distraught and attempts suicide. As a conciliatory gesture, Joe reluctantly returns to work on Salome.\n\nAct II\nJoe is now living in luxury at Norma Desmond's mansion, for reasons he bluntly states are mercenary (\"Sunset Boulevard\"). A cryptic message from Paramount has Norma certain that DeMille is eager to discuss her script (\"There's Been A Call\"). She drops in on the set of his current film and is greeted warmly by former colleagues and the famed director himself, but he is non-committal about Salome (\"As If We Never Said Goodbye\"). Meanwhile, Max discovers the studio had called to ask about Norma's Isotta Fraschini, not her screenplay. However, a delusional Norma leaves the lot convinced she'll soon be back in front of the cameras and begins to prepare for the role (\"Eternal Youth Is Worth a Little Suffering\").\nIncreasingly paranoid, Norma deduces that Joe and Betty are more than just friends (\"Too Much in Love to Care\"). She calls Betty to reveal Joe's secret life at the mansion, but he overhears and grabs the phone to tell Betty to come see for herself. Realizing their affair is doomed, Joe brusquely tells her he enjoys being Norma's pet and that she should go back to Artie. Betty departs, confused and brokenhearted, and Joe tells Norma he is leaving her and returning to his hometown of Dayton, Ohio. He also bluntly informs her that Salome is an unfilmable script and her fans have long abandoned her. Furious and grief-stricken, Norma fatally shoots Joe three times as he storms out of the house.\nNow completely insane, Norma mistakes the swarms of police and reporters who arrive for studio personnel. Imagining herself on the set of Salome, she slowly descends her grand staircase and utters \"And now, Mr. DeMille, I am ready for my close-up.\"\n\nMajor characters\nNorma Desmond \u2013 Mezzo-soprano; a faded, eccentric, former silent screen star\nJoe Gillis \u2013 Baritenor; a struggling young screenwriter\nMax von Mayerling \u2013 Bass-baritone; Norma's first husband and butler\nBetty Schaefer \u2013 Soprano; A budding writer and Joe's love interest\nArtie Green \u2013 Baritenor; Betty's fianc\u00e9\nCecil B.

The cast featured Patti LuPone as Norma Desmond, Kevin Anderson as Joe Gillis, Meredith Braun as Betty Schaefer, and Daniel Benzali as Norma's ex-husband, Max.\nBilly Wilder and his wife Audrey were joined by Nancy Olson, who had played Betty Schaefer in the original film, at the opening night performance. Of it, Wilder observed, \"The best thing they did was leave the script alone,\" and of Patti LuPone he exclaimed, \"She's a star from the moment she walks on stage\".\nReviews were mixed, according to the Associated Press (AP) review summary. That summary quoted, for example, the review by Michael Kuchwara for the AP: \"Some reviewers felt Lloyd Webber took the sting out of a cynical tale. 'Wilder's bitter brew has been diluted,' wrote AP Drama Critic Michael Kuchwara. He added: 'When LuPone is off stage, the show sags.'\" Frank Rich wrote \"Much of the film's plot, dialogue and horror-movie mood are preserved, not to mention clips used to illustrate those sequences in which the faded silent-film star, Norma Desmond ...and her kept, young screenwriter, Joe Gillis, ... travel by car. The lyricist, Don Black ..., and the playwright, Christopher Hampton ..., smartly tailor their jokes to the original screenplay's style. At times, even Lloyd Webber gets into the Wilder swing. Both acts open with joltingly angry diatribes about Hollywood, part exposition-packed recitative and part song, in which the surprisingly dark, jazz-accented music, the most interesting I've yet encountered from this composer, meshes perfectly with the cynical lyrics. Anderson makes the sardonic Wilder voice an almost physical presence in Sunset Boulevard, but he is too often drowned out by both LuPone's Broadway belt and mechanical efforts of Lloyd Webber and his director, Trevor Nunn, to stamp the proven formulas of Phantom and Les Miz on even an intimate tale. At odd moments, the mammoth set advances like a glacier toward the audience or retreats, or, most dramatically, rises partly up into the flies, actors in tow.\"\nThe show closed for three weeks, re-opening on 19 April 1994, revamped to follow the Los Angeles production, with a second official \"opening\". The revamped musical had a new song, \"Every Movie's a Circus\", a new set, and new stars, Betty Buckley and John Barrowman. Anita Louise Combe took over the role of Betty Schaeffer and, as a result of her performance, was invited to play the role in the original Canadian Premiere production in Toronto the following year.  Michael Bauer, who had originally played DeMille, replaced Benzali as Max, a role he played until the end of the London run (and subsequently on the UK tour and in the BBC concert). Buckley and the production garnered rave reviews. David Lister of The Independent, for example wrote: \"The show looked an improvement on the one that got decidedly mixed reviews last summer.\"\nBetty Buckley went on to replace Glenn Close as Norma in the second year of the Broadway production. Elaine Paige, who had filled in when Buckley was ill in 1994, took over the part in the West End in May 1995 before joining the Broadway production for the end of its run between 1996 and 1997. Petula Clark filled in for Paige during her holiday in September\/October 1995, before taking over the role in January 1996 when Paige departed for the United States.  The last actress to play Norma in London was Rita Moreno, who filled in for a vacationing Clark in September and October 1996. John Barrowman played Joe until 1995, when he was replaced by Alexander Hanson. Graham Bickley played the role for the final year of the London run.\nThe show closed on 5 April 1997 after 1,530 performances.\n\nLos Angeles production\nThe American premiere was at the Shubert Theatre in Century City, Los Angeles, California, on 9 December 1993, with Close as Norma and Alan Campbell as Joe. Featured were George Hearn as Max and Judy Kuhn as Betty. Lloyd Webber had reworked both the book and score, tightening the production, better organising the orchestrations, and adding the song \"Every Movie's a Circus\". This new production was better received by the critics and was an instant success, running for 369 performances. The Los Angeles production also recorded a new cast album that is well regarded. It is also the only unabridged cast recording of the show, since the original London recording was trimmed by over thirty minutes.\nA controversy arose with this production after Faye Dunaway was hired to replace Glenn Close. Dunaway went into rehearsals with Rex Smith as Joe and Jon Cypher as Max. Tickets went on sale for Dunaway's engagement but shortly after rehearsals started the producers announced that Dunaway was unable to sing the role to their standards and the production would shut down when Close left. Dunaway \"claims that when advance sales slumped, Sir Andrew decided to save money by sending the LA cast of Sunset Boulevard \u2013 based on the story of a clapped-out Hollywood actress \u2013 to Broadway, where it is due to open in November. \" However, the Los Angeles Times reported that \"The cancellation came despite advance ticket sales for the Los Angeles production 'way in excess of $4 million,' said Peter Brown, a spokesman for Lloyd Webber.\"\nDunaway filed a lawsuit claiming her reputation had been damaged by the producer's claims.  Dunaway's lawsuit was settled and the producers paid her a settlement but no other terms of the agreement have ever been disclosed.\n\nOriginal Broadway production\nThe musical opened on Broadway at the Minskoff Theatre on 17 November 1994 with Close, Campbell, and Hearn recreating their roles from the Los Angeles production and Alice Ripley joining the cast as Betty. Also in the cast were Alan Oppenheimer as Cecil B. DeMille and Vincent Tumeo making his Broadway debut as Artie Green. The production opened with the highest advance in the history of Broadway ticket sales at that time. It closed on 22 March 1997, after playing 977 performances. Billy Wilder was in attendance on opening night and was coaxed onstage by Close for the curtain call. In a season with only one other musical nominated for Best Musical, the production won several Tony Awards; Glenn Close, with only one other nominee as Best Actress in a musical, won the Tony for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role.\nThe New York Times theatre critic Vincent Canby commented about the Tony Awards for this year: \"Awards don't really tell you much when the competition is feeble or simply non-existent, as was the case the year that Sunset Boulevard won its Tony. Such prizes are for use in advertising and promotion and to impress the folks back home.\"\nPatti LuPone, who initially had been promised the Broadway run, sued Lloyd Webber and received a settlement reported to be $1 million. Frank Rich, in his book The Hot Seat, noted that these lawsuits contributed to Sunset Boulevard setting the record for the most money lost by a theatrical endeavour in the history of the United States.  According to The New York Times, operating costs soared far beyond the budget, and the \"Broadway production has earned back, at best, 80% of the initial $13 million\". For example, during the week of 2 July 1995, \"it cost $731,304 to run Sunset Boulevard, including... advertising fees of $138,352 (which had been budgeted at $40,000 a week).\" The road companies also generated large financial losses.  Rich puts the final figure near or above US$20 million lost, making the show what he termed a \"flop-hit\", as it ran more than two years. The musical sold over a million tickets on Broadway.\n\nTouring productions\nThe first national US tour in 1996 starring Linda Balgord ended in early 1997 after only a handful of venues due to exorbitant costs involved in transporting the set. Lloyd Webber called in director Susan H. Schulman to design a scaled-down production, with Petula Clark once again in the lead opposite Lewis Cleale as Joe.  This production featured Anthony Powell's Tony Award nominated costumes, a slightly modified libretto by Schulman and Don Black and a new, more tour-friendly set by Derek McLane. The revised production, opening in Pittsburgh about a year after the closing of the original tour in Chicago, went on the road for almost two years, though it avoided the cities covered by the previous tour.\nIn August 2001, a UK tour commenced in Plymouth starring Faith Brown as Norma, opposite Earl Carpenter as Joe, and Michael Bauer reprising his West End performance as Max. The production had a completely new set, much simpler than the original London set, although the overall production remained closer to the original staging than the revamped US national tour.  Carpenter left midway through the tour and was replaced by Jeremy Finch, who had previously understudied the role.  The tour finished in late 2002 in Manchester and met with both excellent reviews and respectable ticket sales.\nRia Jones, who originated the role of Norma Desmond in the 1991 Sydmonton Workshop and understudied Glenn Close in the 2016 West End revival, led a new production opening at Leicester's Curve Theatre on 16 September 2017 for a two-week run before embarking on a national tour around the United Kingdom. Starring opposite Jones as Norma was Danny Mac as Joe Gillis. The tour, directed by Curve artistic by Nikolai Foster, transferred the musical into a Hollywood sound stage setting, designed by Colin Richmond, with acclaimed use of vintage archive film and projections designed by Douglas O'Connell.\n\nWest End & London revivals\nAn eight-week engagement of a minimalist production, in which the actors used musical instruments, enjoyed a good run at the Watermill Theatre in Newbury over the summer of 2008.  Directed and choreographed by Craig Revel Horwood, the cast featured Kathryn Evans as Norma Desmond and Ben Goddard as Joe Gillis.  A West End transfer of the Watermill production began on 4 December 2008 prior to an official opening 15 December at the Comedy Theatre, with Evans and Goddard reprising their roles, and Dave Willetts joining the cast as Max. The production received rave reviews and extended its run to September 2009. However, the production closed just after initially planned on 30 May 2009. It had originally been booking until 19 September 2009. There were plans for a UK Tour and also talks of bringing the show to Broadway For their performances, Evans and Goddard were nominated for the 2009 Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical and Best Actor in a Supporting Role in a Musical, respectively.\nOpening on 4 April 2016, English National Opera (ENO) presented a five-week 'semi-staged' run at the London Coliseum. Glenn Close reprised her role as Norma, making her London theatre debut, along with Michael Xavier as Joe, Siobhan Dillon as Betty and Fred Johanson as Max. Michael Linnit and Michael Grade for Gate Ventures PLC worked with ENO to present the show; Johnny Hon was the executive producer. For her performance, Close won the 2016 Evening Standard Theatre Award for Best Musical Performance and was nominated for the 2017 Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical. It was announced on 25 October 2016 that the production would transfer to Broadway at the Palace Theatre in a limited engagement.\nThe third revival of the show opened at the Savoy Theatre from September 2023 for a 16-week limited run. Starring Nicole Scherzinger as Norma, the piece was reimagined in a modern and minimalist staging directed by Jamie Lloyd and produced by Lloyd Webber Harrison Musicals. On 14 August 2023, complete casting was announced with Tom Francis, David Thaxton, and Grace Hodgett Young (making her professional debut) starring as Joe, Max, and Betty, respectively. Rachel Tucker guest starred as Norma on 12 October 2023, and played Monday evenings beginning 16 October. Lloyd's production featured many changes to the score, including two songs being cut and substantial lyrical rewrites. \"Let's Have Lunch\" became \"Let's Do Lunch\" and the \"Exit Music\" was more substantively incorporated into the show. The revival won both of its two 2023 Evening Standard Theatre Awards nominations, including Best Musical Performance for Scherzinger and Best Director for Lloyd. It also received eleven nominations at the 2024 Laurence Olivier Awards and won seven, the most for any production of the season, including Best Musical Revival, Best Actress in a Musical for Scherzinger, Best Actor in a Musical for Francis, and Best Director for Lloyd. Thaxton and Hodgett Young were nominated for Best Actor in a Supporting Role in a Musical and Best Actress in a Supporting Role in a Musical awards. Recorded live at the Savoy Theatre and featuring Nicole Scherzinger and the rest of the West End cast, SUNSET BLVD: THE ALBUM is slated for release in October 2024. On 4 January 2024, it was announced that the West End production will transfer to Broadway later that year.\n\nBroadway revivals\nGlenn Close reprised her performance as Norma Desmond in the first revival on Broadway. Featuring a 40-piece onstage orchestra and a relatively minimalist set, the production began performances at the Palace Theatre on 2 February 2017 before opening officially on 9 February for a limited run, with tickets on sale through 25 June 2017. The cast featured Michael Xavier as Joe Gillis, Siobhan Dillon as Betty Schaefer, and Fred Johanson as Max von Mayerling, all reprising their roles from the 2016 London ENO production. The 2017 Broadway revival was directed by Lonny Price.\nThe 2023 West End revival is set to transfer to Broadway at the St. James Theatre, with previews beginning on 28 September 2024 and opening night planned for 20 October. Nicole Scherzinger will reprise her role as Norma and will be joined by her West End co-stars Tom Francis as Joe, David Thaxton as Max, and Grace Hodgett Young as Betty. Mandy Gonzalez will play Norma Desmond for select performances once a week beginning 22 October and Caroline Bowman will serve as the standby for Norma.\n\nInternational productions\nThe original Canadian production opened in Toronto on 15 October 1995, with Diahann Carroll in the lead role. Her performance was praised by critics.  It also starred Rex Smith as Joe, Walter Charles as Max and Anita Louise Combe, who had played Betty in the London production, repeating in this role. Toronto performances ended in August 1996, with the production later moving to Vancouver where it ran from November 1996 to March 1997. A highlights recording of this production was released on CD.\nA German production of the musical opened 7 December 1995 at the newly built Rhein-Main Theater in Niedernhausen near Wiesbaden, starring Helen Schneider and Sue Mathys (matinees) as Norma and Uwe Kr\u00f6ger as Joe. A cast recording (with Schneider and Kr\u00f6ger) was released in 1996. The role of Norma was later played by Daniela Ziegler and Christina Grimandi, with Schneider and, for the last few months, Sue Mathys both returning to play the lead. The production closed in May 1998.\nIn October 1996, the original Australian production of the musical opened at Melbourne's newly restored Regent Theatre. The cast included Debra Byrne as Norma, Hugh Jackman as Joe, and Catherine Porter as Betty. Maria Mercedes starred as the alternate Norma, performing two of the eight shows each week, eventually taking over the role as Norma.  Amanda Harrison took over the role of Betty for the final months of the show's run. The production ran until 14 June 1997.\nA year-long Dutch tour commenced in the Netherlands on 10 October 2008, with Simone Kleinsma and Pia Douwes alternating as Norma and Antonie Kamerling as Joe, using the same modified libretto that was first used in the 2001 UK tour. Kleinsma went on to win the Best Actress Award for the role in the 2009 Dutch Musical Awards and also Best Actress for the Flemish Musical Prizes. An official cast album was released, with Kleinsma appearing on the main album and with a four track bonus CD of Pia Douwes singing Norma's main arias.\nThe Swedish premiere took place at the V\u00e4rmlandsoperan in September 2009, to mostly positive reviews.

Produced by Alpha, the concert was a fully staged production with direction by Jordan Murphy, choreography by Joanna Goodwin, and conducted by Alex Parker. Karimloo, Murray, Strallen, and Secomb reprised their performances.\n\nFilm adaptation\nParamount Pictures and the Relevant Picture Company announced in 2005 that they were developing a film adaptation of the musical. In 2007, The Daily Telegraph reported that actresses considered for the role of Norma Desmond included Close, Paige, Meryl Streep, Liza Minnelli, and Barbra Streisand. In a 2008 interview, Andrew Lloyd Webber said that there were no plans for a film adaptation to be made in the near future, but remained hopeful that one would be made at some point. In 2011, Lloyd Webber indicated that he would have wanted Madonna to star in the film.\nIn a 2013 interview with Elaine Paige during her BBC Radio 2 show Elaine Paige on Sunday, Lloyd Webber was asked about the progress of the film, to which he replied:\n\nI would love a film to be made of Sunset, of course, but unfortunately the rights are owned by Paramount who own the original movie and, so far, talks with them have never led to anything. And it's sad for me because I think in many ways Sunset is, I think, the most complete musical I have written, I mean in the sense that the book and the music and everything come together I think in a way that perhaps even some of the others, they don't. Anyway that's my sadness at the moment and maybe, one day, the whole thing will get brokered. I'm doing something else with Paramount because after I've done this I'm producing School of Rock on stage, and that's a Paramount picture, so maybe if they like what I do with that they'll let me do Sunset.\nIn February 2019, it was announced that Rob Ashford had signed on to direct the film, with Close reprising her role as Norma Desmond and Tom MacRae penning the script, with production slated to begin on October of that year, but was then delayed to the fall of 2020. In an October 2020 interview, Close, along with her confirmation of co-producing the film alongside Lloyd Webber, said that she hoped filming would commence in early 2021, citing the COVID-19 pandemic as the reason for the delay. In May 2021, Close stated in an interview that production was \"very, very close\" to beginning and that they were \"ready to go\", while also adding that Lloyd Webber was still working on new music for the film. However, in October 2021, Lloyd Webber announced that production had been stalled, stating, \"I wish I could say it's going into production tomorrow morning, but it's not. Paramount has not wanted to go ahead with it. It's not for want of trying. Glenn Close has been absolutely doggedly trying to get it made.\" On 2 May 2022, at the 2022 Met Gala, Close revealed that \"We're getting closer, believe it or not. We're getting closer,\" without disclosing any additional information.\nIn May 2024, during Variety's 2024 Power of Women luncheon, Close revealed that the film is still moving forward, but with Ashford no longer attached as director. She went on to remark on how the character of Norma Desmond still resonates in modern times, saying \"That character of Norma is so heartbreakingly beautiful and will never not have relevance, it's been a great blessing to play her and I'm not willing to let her go yet without one more tribute.\"\n\nAwards and nominations\nOriginal West End production\nOriginal Broadway production\n2008 West End revival\n2016 London revival\n2017 Broadway revival\n2023 West End revival\nNotes\nReferences\nGanzl, Kurt.

It was home to the Sunset Junction Street Fair from 1980 through 2010. It is in the southwestern part of the district along Sunset Boulevard.\n\nThe name refers to the street junction of Sunset Boulevard and Santa Monica Boulevard, two of the largest streets in Los Angeles, both of which travel from Sunset Junction to the Pacific Ocean. For most of their distance, the streets run parallel, but join here where they intersect Sanborn Avenue and where Santa Monica Blvd ends.\n\nHistory\nOriginally the junction was formed by the branching of two interurban railway lines and was known as Sanborn or Hollywood Junction. In 1895, the Pasadena and Pacific Railway Company built an interurban rail line from downtown Los Angeles to Santa Monica, whose route ran along Sunset Boulevard as far as Sanborn Avenue, where it turned west along the present alignment of Santa Monica Boulevard. In 1905, the Los Angeles Pacific Railway, successor to the Pasadena and Pacific, built a new branch northwest along Sunset Boulevard from Sanborn Avenue as a shortcut to its existing line on Hollywood Boulevard, forming the junction that is still reflected in the existing street configuration.  The Los Angeles Pacific Company was one of the eight rail companies merged in 1911 to form the Pacific Electric Railway. Rail service ceased on the two lines in 1954 and 1953, respectively.\nSunset  Junction is the site of one of the first actions in the nation against police activity in gay bars, the Black Cat Tavern protest, which began on February 11, 1967, almost two and a half years before the more famous protest at the Stonewall Inn in New York's Greenwich Village. The event is named for the Black Cat Tavern, formerly at 3909 Sunset Blvd between Sanborn and Hyperion Avenues, a location that had been a gay bar periodically since the 1940s. Organized in response to a police raid on the Black Cat on New Year's Eve 1966, in which several people were hurt, the protest was planned  to coincide with similar actions at African-American, Latino and \u201chippie\u201d establishments  around the city, which were also regularly patrolled.  Of these, the protest at the Black Cat was most successful, with over 200 people marching without any violent confrontation.  The Black Cat protest continued for several days but did not attract the media attention that the protests at the Stonewall Inn later did.\nFor many years Silver Lake housed a small, quiet gay and lesbian population, but in the 1970s a combination of affordable housing, a bohemian ambiance and promotion by gay real estate agents caused the gay and lesbian population to swell to more than 20% of the neighborhood total.\nIn 1979, an early literary gay and lesbian bookstores, A Different Light, was founded at 4014 Santa Monica Boulevard. The store functioned as a focal point for the community and was the site of readings by noted authors, including  Christopher Isherwood, Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs and Larry Kramer. Subsequently, additional branches were opened in West Hollywood (1990), San Francisco, and Greenwich Village in Manhattan.  The original store closed in 1992, as have the branches in Greenwich Village, West Hollywood, and San Francisco.\nTensions in the 1970s between the growing gay and lesbian population and working-class Latino families in the Silver Lake neighborhood led the integrated lesbian and gay Sunset Junction Neighborhood Alliance to organize the first Sunset Junction Street Fair in 1980.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nCurbed LA: Sunset Junction posts","212":"Sunset Sound Recorders is a recording studio in Hollywood, California, United States, located at 6650 Sunset Boulevard.\n\nBackground\nThe Sunset Sound Recorders complex was created by Walt Disney's Director of Recording, Tutti Camarata, from a collection of old commercial and residential buildings. At the encouragement of Disney himself, Camarata began the project in 1958, starting with a former automotive repair garage whose sloping floor would tend to reduce unwanted sonic standing wave reflections. Soon, the audio for many of Disney's early films was being recorded at the studio, including Bedknobs and Broomsticks, Mary Poppins, and 101 Dalmatians\nOver 200 Gold records have been recorded at Sunset Sound, including hit albums for Elton John, Led Zeppelin, Van Halen, Toto, parts of Prince's Purple Rain, the Rolling Stones' Exile on Main St., Neil Young's After the Gold Rush, the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds, Linda Ronstadt's Don't Cry Now, parts of Guns N' Roses' Chinese Democracy and Janis Joplin's posthumously-released Pearl. In addition, the Doors recorded their first two albums, The Doors and Strange Days, at the studio. Idina Menzel recorded her vocal track for the song \"Let It Go\" for Disney Animation's 2013 film Frozen at the studio.\nIn 1981, Sunset Sound Recorders owner Camarata purchased The Sound Factory, another Los Angeles recording studio founded by Moonglow Records and later purchased and developed by David Hassinger. With many people experiencing homelessness camped nearby, the studio expressed their frustration with the situation in 2024. The city program, Inside Safe, had the unhoused residents accept services and housing in mid-2024.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\n2019 video tour of Sunset Sound by engineer Warren Huart\nArchive of 2009 Sunset Sound and Sound Factory website","213":"The Sunset Strip is the 1.7-mile (2.7 km) stretch of Sunset Boulevard that passes through the city of West Hollywood, California, United States. It extends from West Hollywood's eastern border with the city of Los Angeles near Marmont Lane  to its western border with Beverly Hills at Phyllis Street. The Sunset Strip is known for its boutiques, restaurants, rock clubs, and nightclubs, as well as its array of huge, colorful billboards.\n\nHistory\nPrior to the 1984 incorporation of the city of West Hollywood, the Sunset Strip lay in an unincorporated area of Los Angeles County. Because of this, the Sunset Strip and all of West Hollywood gained a reputation for being a loosely regulated area, in large part because it was not under the jurisdiction of the Los Angeles Police Department.\n\n1920s\nGambling was illegal in the city of Los Angeles, but legal in unincorporated Los Angeles County, which fostered the development of rather wilder nightlife in West Hollywood than was found within the city limits. In the 1920s a number of nightclubs and casinos moved in along Sunset Strip, which attracted movie people; alcohol was served in back rooms during Prohibition.\n\n1930s and 1940s\nIn the 1930s and the 1940s, restaurants and nightclubs on Sunset Strip, like Sherry's, Ciro's, the Mocambo and the Trocadero, were patronized by people working in the movie industry. Some of its expensive nightclubs and restaurants were said to be owned by gangsters like Mickey Cohen and Bugsy Siegel, earning Sunset Strip a place in Raymond Chandler's 1949 Philip Marlowe novel, The Little Sister. Also on Sunset Strip are the Garden of Allah apartments\u2014Hollywood quarters for transplanted writers like Robert Benchley, Dorothy Parker, and F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2014and Schwab's Drug Store.\n\n1960s\nBy the early 1960s, Sunset Strip had lost favor with the majority of movie people, but its restaurants, bars and clubs continued to serve as an attraction for locals and tourists. In the mid-1960s it became a major gathering place for the counterculture and was the scene of the Sunset Strip curfew riots in November 1966, involving police and crowds of young club-goers. Those riots inspired the Buffalo Springfield song \"For What It's Worth\".\nSunset Strip became popular with rock musicians and their fans. Bands such as Led Zeppelin, the Doors, the Byrds, Love, the Seeds, Frank Zappa, and others played at clubs like Gazzarri's, the Whisky a Go Go, the Roxy, Pandora's Box and the London Fog. In July 1965 Go-Go dancers also began performing.  The Hyatt West Hollywood (now known as the Andaz West Hollywood) became a popular hotel.\n\n1970s\nRodney Bingenheimer's English Disco, influenced by Britain's glam rock movement, opened in 1972. It became a hangout for musicians, including the Stooges and the New York Dolls. Clubs on the Sunset Strip at that time, Rodney Bingenheimer's in particular, were notorious for allowing teenage patrons. \"Nobody carried or cared about ID's. Thirteen-year-old girls could walk in dressed like sexy 25-year-olds, and kids could sidle up to the bar and order a cocktail, so it wasn't a big stretch for us to get up and play there\", recalled Quiet Riot founder Kelly Garni. The 1979 Donna Summer song \"Sunset People\", from the album Bad Girls, was about the nightlife on Sunset Boulevard. Sunset Strip continued to be a major focus for punk rock and new wave music during the late 1970s.\n\n1980s\nDuring the latter part of the 1970s and well into the 1980s, the Sunset Strip would become synonymous with the Los Angeles heavy metal movement, commonly referred to as the West Coast Metal Explosion. The clubs on the Sunset Strip such as the Whisky a Go Go and The Roxy, became home to numerous LA-based heavy metal bands such as Van Halen, Quiet Riot, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, Ratt and Guns N' Roses. The scene became synonymous with glam metal, with many fans mimicking the hair and clothing worn by the bands. The many heavy metal fans who would congregate outside the clubs along the strip became a defining feature.\nThe adoption of \"pay to play\" policies, in which bands were charged a fee to play at clubs, diminished its appeal to groups, other than as an industry showcase. As of the 2010s, the music industry establishment continues to dominate the clubs on Sunset Strip.\nIn November 1984, voters in West Hollywood passed a proposal on the ballot to incorporate, and the area became an independent city. Increasingly, the western end of Sunset Strip was occupied by office buildings, mostly catering to the entertainment industry, as well as hotels.\n\n1990s\nDuring the 1990s, the center of the alternative music activity in Los Angeles shifted further east to areas like Echo Park, Silver Lake and Los Feliz.\n\nLandmarks\nIn popular culture\n77 Sunset Strip, a 1958\u20131964 TV series, was set on Sunset Strip between La Cienega Boulevard and Alta Loma Road.\nStudio 60 on the Sunset Strip was a behind-the-scenes television drama of a late-night comedy sketch show performed at a fictional theater on Sunset Strip.\nPremiering on January 27, 2006, in Los Angeles at Vanguard Hollywood, the Rock of Ages stage production inspired the 2012 film of the same name. Its story line is centered along Sunset Strip in 1987.\nThe opening credits of the HBO TV series Entourage featured shots of Sunset Strip.\nLos Angeles-based artist Edward Ruscha created the artist's book Every Building on the Sunset Strip in 1966, later 12 Sunsets website for the Getty Research Institute.\n\nExplanatory notes\nReferences\nCitations\nGeneral bibliography\nChick, Steve (2009).

The street is an east-west thoroughfare that runs through Downtown Los Angeles parallel to the Hollywood Freeway between Virgil Avenue past Alameda Street to the banks of the Los Angeles River.  It was developed as a simple one-block long lane by Jonathan Temple, a mid-19th Century Los Angeles cattle rancher and merchant.  \nOriginally, Temple began at Main Street, from which Spring Street also began running towards the southwest. The south side of this intersection where the three streets met was called Temple Block, an important retail building in early Los Angeles. In the 1920s and 1930s, Spring Street was rerouted to be parallel with Main Street, so that it intersected Temple one block west of Main Street.\n\nWest Temple Street\nFrom the late 1860s, development pushed westward from what was then the central business district, and West Temple Street became a fashionable residential thoroughfare, and remained so into the 1880s. The city's High School opened in 1871 at Temple's south edge atop Poundcake Hill, since flattened. It was removed and the prominent \"Red Sandstone\" Courthouse stood in the same place starting in 1891. A Hall of Records followed in 1911. After the construction of City Hall in 1925, the area between Temple and 3rd Streets, from Los Angeles Street westward to Hill Street, was designated the Civic Center district, and so Temple Street became lined with civic buildings. \nUntil the 1920s, Temple Street, as the city continued to grow west towards the ocean, was extended all the way to Beverly Hills.  With, however, the creation of Beverly Boulevard, Temple Street was terminated at its current location at Virgil Avenue, near Silver Lake Boulevard.  From that point, the roadway is Beverly Boulevard to Santa Monica Boulevard.\n\nEast Temple Street\nOn the east side, Only after 1930 was Temple Street extended eastward past Main Street into the industrial district of town. East of Alameda Street, Temple Street occupies the former Turner Street, Temple Street terminates just east of Center Street and just west of the Los Angeles River and the railroad switch yards.\n\nFamous residents\nActor Danny Trejo was born on Temple Street.\n\nNotable landmarks\nSeveral important Los Angeles landmarks are on the street:\n\nAhmanson Theater\nCathedral of Our Lady of the Angels\nEcho Park\nGrand Park\nHistoric Filipinotown\nLittle Tokyo\nLos Angeles City Hall\nLos Angeles County Hall of Records\nLos Angeles County Department of Health Services\nLos Angeles Public Library's Echo Park Branch\nLos Angeles Police Department's Rampart Station\nEdward R.

They took over the building previously occupied by a strip club owned by Chuck Landis called the Largo. (Adler was also responsible for bringing the stage play The Rocky Horror Show to the United States, and it opened its first American run at The Roxy Theatre in 1974, before it was made into the movie The Rocky Horror Picture Show the next year.)\nNeil Young and the Santa Monica Flyers (billed as Crazy Horse, a related ensemble) played the Roxy for the first three days it was open.

The strongest drink is purported to be the \"Stealth.\"\nAlthough the Tiki-Ti does not serve typical bar cocktails such as the martini, the cosmopolitan or beer, their drink menu does consist of over 80 exotic drinks\u2014many of which are originals.  Drink names are colorful and include Yellow Bird, Laka Nuki, Bayanihan, Bonnie & Clyde and the Missionary's Downfall, just to name a few.  For those who cannot decide what drink to choose, the bar offers a wheel that patrons can spin to help them make up their mind.\n\nSee also\nMai-kai restaurant\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nCalendar","218":"State Route 27, commonly known by its street name Topanga Canyon Boulevard ( ), is a state highway in the U.S. state of California that runs from the Pacific Coast Highway (California State Route 1) at Topanga State Beach near Pacific Palisades, through the Topanga Canyon in Topanga, and continuing through Woodland Hills, Canoga Park, West Hills, and Chatsworth to the Ronald Reagan Freeway (State Route 118).\nAs one of the only routes across the Santa Monica Mountains, SR 27 is heavily traveled by commuters from the western San Fernando Valley heading to Santa Monica or Interstate 10.\n\nRoute description\nSR 27 begins at SR 1 near the Pacific Ocean at Topanga County Beach, in an unincorporated area of Los Angeles County east of Malibu. It travels north as Topanga Canyon Boulevard, cutting through Topanga State Park. Upon exiting the park, SR 27 provides access to Fernwood, Topanga, Sylvia Park, and Glenview, all unincorporated. SR 27 continues winding into the San Fernando Valley, nearly entering Calabasas before entering the Los Angeles community of Woodland Hills. The route becomes a major city arterial through the valley, intersecting US 101 before entering Warner Center and Canoga Park. After traversing Chatsworth, SR 27 ends just past an interchange with the SR 118 freeway, thus providing access to the unincorporated area north of Chatsworth.\nA segment of Metro Local line 150 runs on Topanga Canyon Boulevard between Ventura Boulevard and Devonshire Street.\nExcept for a small portion in the mountains, SR 27 is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 27 is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System. A portion of it through Topanga Canyon has been officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation.\n\nHistory\nThe original state highway system in 1933 included a highway from near Topanga Beach to Montalvo-San Fernando Road near Chatsworth. Two years later, this was numbered as Route 156. The route was redesignated as SR 27 in the 1964 state highway renumbering.\n\nMajor intersections\nExcept where prefixed with a letter, postmiles were measured on the road as it was in 1964, based on the alignment that existed at the time, and do not necessarily reflect current mileage. R reflects a realignment in the route since then, M indicates a second realignment, L refers to an overlap due to a correction or change, and T indicates postmiles classified as temporary (for a full list of prefixes, see California postmile \u00a7 Official postmile definitions). Segments that remain unconstructed or have been relinquished to local control may be omitted. The entire route is in Los Angeles County.\n\nSee also\nCalifornia Roads portal\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nCaltrans: State Route 27 highway conditions\nCaltrans Traffic Conditions Map\nCalifornia Highway Patrol Traffic Incidents\nCalifornia Highways: SR 27\nCalifornia @ AARoads.com - State Route 27","219":"The Tiffany Theater was the first theater on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood, California. It stood west of La Cienega between the Playboy Club and Dino's Lodge restaurant. Before being converted from the Mary Webb Davis Modeling School office at 8532 W. Sunset Blvd to a movie theater, the building had been seen in the 1958\u20131964 television  series 77 Sunset Strip as the office for detectives Efrem Zimbalist, Jr., Roger Smith, and Edd Byrnes.\n\nHistory\nThe Tiffany opened on November 2, 1966 and was owned by producer Robert L. Lippert and veteran exhibitor Harold Goldman. It was equipped with 400 seats, and boasted \u201cContinental Seating\u201d with no aisle up the middle for \u201cmaximum audience viewing and comfort.\u201d It was designed by architect Jack Edwards and built by Lippert Construction Company, with carpets provided by B.F. Shearer and seats from Haywood \u2013Wakefield.  The interior of the theater was designed by Ben Mayer with the new fa\u00e7ade and marquee designed by Heath & Company for the structure that was originally built in 1935. One of its unique design elements was that the entrance was located to the right side of the screen and in the middle of the auditorium separating it into long top and bottom sections instead of the more common left, center and right design. At the time, the $250,000 theater was the most expensive house Lippert had ever built. The newly opened Tiffany Theater can be seen in the Mondo documentary The Forbidden. In that film, the marquee displays \"Young Aphrodites\" and Bergman's \"Smiles of a Summer Night.\"  \"Young Aphrodites\" was the first film to be shown there, with gala champagne opening. It can also be seen in the 1967 John Boorman film \"Point Blank\" when the character 'Walker', portrayed by Lee Marvin first sees the 'Yost' character played by Keenan Wynn. The theatre can be seen from the roof of the Lou Costello Building opposite and is showing the 1965 Danish sex comedy \"Eric Soya's 17\", also known as \"Sytten\".\nBy 1968, the Tiffany was hosting live performances by the improv troop, The Committee, featuring future celebrities Howard Hessman, Peter Bonerz and Rob Reiner. The act was filmed, and it debuted as a feature film at the Tiffany in May, 1978. The Committee was followed by the \"Sensual Musical Fantasy\" As You Like It (based on Shakespeare's play), which took the stage for several months. In 1970, it was replaced by a live show called \"Man and Wife,\" which was advertised as a \"documentary performance\" depicting scenes from a marriage. Legal trouble erupted as the show was declared obscene by a local Judge. Although cast members testified it was simulated, several performers were arrested for performing a scene  \"allegedly involving sexual intercourse.\"\n\nNew management\nIn the summer of 1971, the Tiffany adopted a policy of showing two films for 49 cents. By the mid \u201870s, the theater was closed, reopening on March 16, 1977 as a revival theater and art house leased by film enthusiast Tommy Cooper. The first films shown at the revamped Tiffany were a trio of vintage Sherlock Holmes films (The Scarlet Claw, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Sherlock Holmes Faces Death) followed by the first showing in over 20 years of the 1953 3D film Kiss Me Kate. Cooper operated other revival theaters in the Los Angeles area, including the Tiffany's sister theater, the Vagabond, near downtown.\n\nGolden years\nOn June 10, 1977, the Tiffany began showing The Rocky Horror Picture Show at midnights on Friday and Saturday nights. It rapidly became a hub of the Rocky Horror cult while remaining a prime destination for a variety of overlooked films, new and old. In the days before home video rental, the Tiffany became known for showing quality prints of classics like MGM musicals and other vintage titles, while also showcasing a variety of rock films. It was not unusual for a film like Lawrence of Arabia to show one week, followed by The Song Remains the Same the next. Many gay themed films played there as well, at a time when such content was seldom seen or brushed aside by mainstream theaters.\n\nUnique attributes\nA unique attribute of the Tiffany was the moderate angle of the theater, creating the perfect projection conditions for 3D films. The Tiffany often took advantage of these conditions, showing many rare revivals of 3D movies including Dial M for Murder, House of Wax and Kiss Me Kate. The layout of the theater also enhanced the Rocky Horror experience as well, with a low-situated screen and a perfectly located aisle in the middle of the theater, audience participation included creating a variety of shadow-images on the screen by holding up hands or props at various times in the movie. One of the biggest reactions at the Tiffany's Rocky Horror screenings came on nights when the marquee letters \u201cJ-A-N-E-T\u201d were held up during the song \u201cDamnit, Janet\u201d by a group of regular attendees at precise time actor Barry Bostwick sang a line reciting the letters. The letters appeared on the screen as if they were actually projected there, to the boisterous delight of the audience.\n\n3D Movies at the Tiffany\nKiss Me Kate\nIt Came From Outer Space\nGorilla at Large\nThe Mad Magician\nInferno\n3 Stooges Short Spooks & Pardon My Backfire\nMan In Dark\nMiss Sadie Thomson\nAndy Warhol's Frankenstein in 3D\nCartoons in 3D\nHouse of Wax\nDynasty\nDial M for Murder\n\nHub of a cult\nAs Rocky Horror became more popular, the crowds grew and 2 AM shows were added on Friday and Saturday nights. In the summer of 1979, there was a midnight show on Thursday nights as well. That same summer, the Tiffany was the only theater with the original, uncut, version of Rocky Horror including the then scarce \u201cSuper Heroes\u201d ending.  The Tiffany was legendary in its day for the over-the-top audience participation, which included a real-life hopeful transsexual, Garrett Gafford, appearing in the pre-show cast as Frank N Furter.  On more than one occasion, a real motorcycle rode around the theater during Meatloaf's \u201cHot Patootie\u201d number in the movie as well. As a result of the mayhem, a number of media outlets began to cover the wild activities. It has been noted by patrons in the late '70s and early '80s that the line outside the Tiffany waiting to get into Rocky Horror was as much fun as the movie itself.\nPart of the draw was the friendly environment fostered by the Tiffany's management and staff. Much of the staff was made up of hired audience members and theater regulars. A \"party\" atmosphere was encouraged, and enhanced by the large number of repeat patrons and performers who attended Rocky Horror. Up until the early '80s, the midnight showings at the Tiffany were complete sell-outs every week. Many of the regulars were allowed to attend ticketless, and sat on the floor up front or in the aisles. It was not uncommon for die-hards to remain through the 2 AM shows as well, which kept things lively all night long. Many up-and-coming Hollywood figures worked at the Tiffany during this period, including Variety Senior Editor Steven Gaydos who managed the Tiffany, and Emmy-winning screenwriter Rene Balcer who worked as an usher exclusively for the Rocky Horror Picture Show screenings.\nRocky Horror stars Tim Curry and Susan Sarandon each came to the Tiffany in the late '70s and signed the movie's permanent one sheet in the theater's lobby. Barry Bostwick attended a special anniversary screening on June 19, 1981. He also signed the one sheet, as well as presenting the theater with a pair of original briefs that he wore in the film. Bostwick discusses the experience on the 35th Anniversary edition DVD's special features interview, Don't Dream It, Be It: The Search for the 35th Anniversary Shadowcast. Other local celebrities were spotted at midnight shows as well, including Jane Fonda, David Carradine, Ann Robinson, Steve Vai, and even Captain Kangaroo himself, Bob Keeshan.\n\nEnd of an era\nBy the time Cooper's lease ran out in 1983, home video was rapidly making revival theaters irrelevant. Additionally, Rocky Horror was playing in more theaters than ever, cutting into the Tiffany's main source of income. Cooper let go of the theater, and it was announced that it would soon be converted into a \u201clegitimate theater.\u201d The Tiffany closed its doors after its final midnight screening of The Rocky Horror Picture Show on March 13, 1983. Both the signed poster and the underwear (framed and autographed) were auctioned off that night along with several other artifacts from the Tiffany's lobby.\n\nLive theater\nThe Tiffany was ready to reopen in June, 1985 as two separate 99-seat live theaters, though there was a several month delay due to a conflict with Actors Equity.  Once the Union's issues were resolved, the Tiffany became an active home for small, but respected, performances, featuring some well-known or soon-to be famous cast members. Among the more high-profile offerings was a four-month run of an updated  The Rocky Horror Show, which opened on January 29, 1999 and starred David Arquette. Not coincidentally, the original Rocky Horror Show had its US opening at the Roxy Theater, a few blocks down the Sunset Strip from the Tiffany.\n\nLive productions at the Tiffany\n1985: Rain \n1986: The Killing of Michael Malloy\n1989: Wolverines (Tom Patchett)\n1989: King of Hearts (Edward Winter, Courteney Cox, Michael Spound, Larry Randolph)\n1990: Blossom Dearie  (in a 2-week musical engagement, in May)\n1990: A Shayna Maidel    1992: Woman in Mind ( Helen Mirren, Paxton Whitehead, Angela Payton, J.D.

It reopened in September of the same year.  In 1999, there was talk of moving the theater across the street as part of a re-development plan for the entire block, though \"The Sunset Millennium Project\" was postponed for many years. The Tiffany remained a live theater through 2002, and in 2004, it briefly became the home of the Actors Studio, though it closed at the end of that year. It remained closed and available for lease until 2013.\nOn August 8, 2013, CIM Group began demolition of the Tiffany and the surrounding structures to make way for its re-christened Sunset\/La Cienega Project, a hotel development at 8490 Sunset Boulevard and residential development at 8500 Sunset Boulevard.  On August 26, the Tiffany's historic sign letters were part of an archival rescue by Tommy Gelinas of Valley Relics Museum and Alison Martino's Vintage Los Angeles preservation group. Jason Relic Hunter removed the sign with the help of a crew of volunteers, while a small group of the theater's former patrons gathered to watch. The theater letters are now displayed at Valley Relics Museum.  The demolition of the Tiffany Theater was completed on August 30, 2013. All that remains of the historic block is a marker in the sidewalk at what was 8524 Sunset Blvd, designating it as the shooting location of 77 Sunset Strip.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nCinema Treasures: The Tiffany Theater\nTroy Martin: Absolute Pleasure (Story of the Tiffany Theater)","220":"U.S. Route 101 (US 101) is a major north\u2013south United States Numbered Highway, stretching from Los Angeles, California, to Tumwater, Washington. The California portion of US 101 is one of the last remaining and longest U.S. Routes still active in the state, and the longest highway of any kind in California. US 101 was also one of the original national routes established in 1926. Significant portions of US 101 between the Los Angeles area and the San Francisco Bay Area follow El Camino Real, the commemorative route connecting the former Alta California's 21 missions.\nAlthough the highway has been superseded in overall importance for transportation through the state by Interstate 5 (I-5), US 101 continues to be the major coastal north\u2013south route that links the Greater Los Angeles Area, the Central Coast, the San Francisco Bay Area, and the North Coast (Redwood Empire). Generally referred to as \"101\" by residents of Northern California, in Southern California it is often called \"The 101\" (pronounced \"the one oh one\"). The highway has portions designated as the Santa Ana Freeway, the Hollywood Freeway, the Ventura Freeway, South Valley Freeway, and Bayshore Freeway, as well as El Camino Real in many non-freeway segments. The Redwood Highway, the 350-mile-long (560 km) northernmost segment of the highway, begins at the Golden Gate and passes through the world's tallest and only extensive preserves of virgin, old-growth coast redwood trees.\n\nRoute description\nUS 101 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration.\nPortions of US 101 are eligible to be included in the State Scenic Highway System. It is officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) from Goleta to Las Cruces in Santa Barbara County, and through Del Norte Coast Redwoods State Park in Del Norte County. This designation means that there are substantial sections of highway passing through a \"memorable landscape\" with no \"visual intrusions\", where the potential designation has gained popular favor with the community.\n\nLos Angeles to Ventura\nThe south terminus of US 101 is in Los Angeles, about one mile (1.6 km) east of downtown Los Angeles at the East Los Angeles Interchange, also known as the \"Commuters' Complex\". This southernmost portion is named the Santa Ana Freeway, inheriting that title as the northerly extension of the roadway now known as I-5. US 101 heads north for 2 miles (3.2 km) before merging with the western end of the San Bernardino Freeway (I-10).\nAfter merging with westbound traffic from the San Bernardino Freeway (I-10), US 101 then proceeds northwest via the Downtown Slot under the northern edge of Los Angeles' Civic Center to State Route 110 (SR 110) at the Four Level Interchange. From here, US 101 becomes the Hollywood Freeway. It then passes through the L.A. neighborhoods of Echo Park, Silver Lake, and Los Feliz and heads to Hollywood and up through the Cahuenga Pass before reaching the San Fernando Valley.\nUS 101 passes right next to the Universal Studios Hollywood and then intersects with SR 134 and SR 170 at the interchange known as the Hollywood Split. Here, the alignment of US 101 shifts to the alignment of SR 134 (i.e. heading northbound, the road's alignment turns left, or westbound) and thereafter is referred to as the Ventura Freeway until it reaches Ventura. Though confusing, the \"Hollywood Freeway\" name continues northward from this interchange on SR 170, and the \"Ventura Freeway\" name continues eastward to SR 134.\nFrom the Hollywood Split, US 101 is an east\u2013west highway (until it reaches Gaviota State Park in Santa Barbara County where it shifts back to a north\u2013south alignment). It meets with I-405 in Sherman Oaks. The east\u2013west geographical alignment of the Ventura Freeway and the north\u2013south designation which appears on the freeway signs can be confusing to visitors; the same freeway entrance can often be signed as \"101 North\" and \"101 West\"; this is most common in the San Fernando Valley where the local E\/W signing does not match the Caltrans' proper statewide N\/S designation.\nAfter the Conejo Grade, which is a 7% grade incline, the freeway enters the Oxnard Plain and runs concurrent with SR 1 for the first time. Upon reaching Ventura, there is an interchange with SR 126, which runs east to Santa Clarita.\n\nCentral Coast\nNorth of Santa Barbara, US 101 switches intermittently between freeway and expressway status (i.e. there is occasional cross-traffic), but there are no traffic signals until San Francisco. From Ventura and through Santa Barbara, US 101 closely follows the Gaviota Coast (generally no more than one to two miles [1.6 to 3.2 km] from the shore) until Gaviota State Park, about 23 miles (37 km) west of Goleta. At Gaviota State Park, the highway shifts back from an east\u2013west highway to a north\u2013south alignment. About one mile (1.6 km) north of this point, the northbound lanes pass through the Gaviota Tunnel.\nA few miles north of the Gaviota Tunnel, SR 1 splits from US 101 and heads northwest, running along the Pacific coastline parallel and to the west of US 101. US 101 passes through Buellton, Los Alamos, Orcutt, Santa Maria, and Nipomo. South of Santa Maria, US 101 widens from a four-lane highway to a six-lane freeway. SR 166 joins US 101 for about 3 miles (4.8 km) before splitting just north of the city limits, while US 101 continues as a four-lane freeway before reverting to expressway status north of Nipomo.\nFarther north, SR 1 rejoins US 101 between Pismo Beach and San Luis Obispo. Then US 101 takes an inland route through the Salinas Valley, while Highway 1 heads northwest, running along the Pacific coastline in California, parallel and to the west of US 101.\nA steep segment (7% grade) between San Luis Obispo and Atascadero is known as the Cuesta Grade. North of Atascadero, the highway joins SR 46 for about three miles (4.8 km) through Paso Robles.\nFrom Paso Robles to Salinas, US 101 is an expressway known as the Salinas River Valley Highway, since the Salinas River Valley extends from Santa Margarita to the SR 156 junction in Prunedale. US 101 resumes freeway status between San Miguel and King City, bypassing the smaller towns of Camp Roberts, Bradley, and San Ardo, as well as the San Ardo Oil Field about five miles (8.0 km) south of San Ardo. Near this point, the wide agricultural bottomlands of the Salinas Valley begins. North of King City, US 101 once again switches intermittently between freeway and expressway status, passing through Greenfield, Soledad, Gonzales, and Chualar before reaching Salinas. Shortly after leaving Salinas, US 101 joins SR 156 in Prunedale for about eight miles (13 km). After crossing the San Benito County line, SR 156 splits from US 101 near San Juan Bautista while US 101 continues northward mostly as a four-lane highway until it reaches Gilroy.\n\nSan Francisco Bay Area\nUS 101 crosses the Pajaro River into Santa Clara County as a four-lane highway, with an interchange at SR 25 a few miles later. Upon reaching Gilroy, it becomes the South Valley Freeway (as in South Santa Clara Valley), and at the same time, it expands to three lanes in each direction. It then enters Silicon Valley when reaching Morgan Hill, and shortly afterwards expands to four lanes in each direction, with an HOV lane in the middle, before reaching San Jose. From San Jose to San Francisco, US 101 is known as the Bayshore Freeway as it passes through Palo Alto and the other major communities along the San Francisco Peninsula.\nUS 101 is called the James Lick Freeway, named for James Lick, a philanthropist, from the San Francisco county\/city line, through the interchange with I-280 at the Alemany Maze, until the junction with the San Francisco Skyway (I-80) and the Central Freeway near the city's Civic Center. US 101 continues in a northwestern direction on the Central Freeway, and then leaves the freeway, on Mission Street (northbound) and South Van Ness Avenue (southbound), to run north on Van Ness Avenue. At the intersection of Van Ness Avenue and Lombard Street, US 101 heads west on Lombard Street, and then on Richardson Avenue, entering The Presidio, where it becomes a divided highway again (the Presidio Parkway). It is then joined by Route 1 before approaching and crossing the Golden Gate Bridge.\nFrom San Francisco north the highway is heavily traveled by commuters through to Windsor, just north of Santa Rosa. North of the Golden Gate Bridge, US 101 enters Marin County and is known as the Redwood Highway. After crossing the bridge, US 101 climbs the Waldo Grade and passes through the Robin Williams Tunnel, the only one of its kind in 300 miles (480 km) (the other being the Gaviota Tunnel in Santa Barbara County). Upon exiting the tunnel, it passes above the hillside town of Sausalito and descends to Richardson Bay, where SR 1 splits from the freeway and heads to the coast. US 101 then passes through Mill Valley, Corte Madera, Larkspur, San Rafael and Novato, before entering Sonoma County. The section between Novato in Marin County and Petaluma in Sonoma County changes from its original six or eight lanes through Marin to four lanes, creating a bottleneck, and is thus called the \"Novato Narrows\" by locals. The Narrows continue up to the county line between Marin and Sonoma Counties. The entire area between Novato and Petaluma is also the voter approved Novato\u2013Petaluma Community Separator, which forbids most development.\nUpon entering Sonoma County, the freeway widens again to six lanes from the county line to Windsor, passing through Petaluma, Cotati, Rohnert Park, and Santa Rosa. Upon reaching Windsor, the freeway returns to two lanes in each direction, crossing the Russian River in Healdsburg and then following the river up the Alexander Valley. SR 128 joins US 101 in the town of Geyserville before splitting just north of Cloverdale. US 101 then heads up a steep hill just before leaving Sonoma County and entering Mendocino County.\n\nNorth Coast\nUS 101 crosses into Mendocino County as a freeway for one mile (1.6 km), but then narrows to an expressway through the Russian River canyon and eventually a two-lane road south of Hopland, the first time since leaving San Francisco. Just before reaching Ukiah, US 101 becomes a four-lane freeway. In the community of Calpella, SR 20 merges with US 101 for the next 15.5 miles (24.9 km) to Willits. The freeway portion ends as the combined US 101 and SR 20 ascend the 1,956-foot (596 m) Ridgewood Summit, the highest elevation along the route's 808-mile-long (1,300 km) trek through California. As US 101 resumes freeway status just south of Willits, SR 20 splits from US 101 shortly before it suddenly reverts to a 2-lane undivided freeway and eventually a highway north of Willits.\nUS 101 then widens to a four-lane expressway until the intersection with the western portion of SR 162, where it reverts to a two-lane road. North of Laytonville, US 101 ascends Rattlesnake summit (1,796 feet or 547 metres) before a descent to follow the South Fork Eel River and Eel River all the way to Fortuna near the mouth of the river. About 12 miles (19 km) northwest of Laytonville, US 101 becomes an undivided freeway near the community of Cummings. SR 271 is the old portion of US 101 through this area. At Leggett, US 101 meets SR 1 for the last time, and from this point until Piercy, US 101 runs along a section of highway with frequent landslides. Caltrans bypassed the most difficult section in 2009 with unique construction of two bridges known collectively as the Confusion Hill Bridges. This project, funded by an emergency act from the State Legislature, moved the highway across the Eel River away from the troubled spots to prevent disruption in commerce and travel from infrequent, but costly, winter closures on the main transportation route to the far North Coast. North of Piercy, the freeway portion again ends and the road narrows down to two lanes, before another stretch of divided highway.\nArriving in Humboldt County, another narrow two-lane portion of US 101 bisects Richardson Grove State Park. Because of the narrow lanes and the redwood trees that tower over this segment of the highway, standard-sized trucks in compliance with the Surface Transportation Assistance Act (STAA) are prohibited through the park. Just after the park boundary, the highway switches to a short undivided freeway and then eventually a divided freeway just before reaching Garberville. North of Garberville, US 101 reverts to an undivided freeway, which continuing north by northwest, passes through the 53,000-acre (210 km2) Humboldt Redwoods State Park, California's third largest State Park and the site of the largest remaining Redwood old growth forest in the world. A preserved portion of the original, bypassed highway route, known as the Avenue of the Giants for the huge, centuries-old redwood trees, parallels the highway for over 30 miles (48 km) in southern Humboldt County. US 101 again switches to another stretch of divided freeway near the town Pepperwood before reverting to a short, 2-mile (3 km) expressway just north of Stafford. A short freeway then runs through Rio Dell before another short, 3-mile (5 km) expressway.\nShortly before reaching the western terminus of SR 36, US 101 becomes a freeway again between Fortuna and Eureka. North of Humboldt Hill, the road enters the City of Eureka (a potential new freeway cutting through or bypass of the city was successfully blocked repeatedly). As the route traverses Eureka, the southern portion is known as \"Broadway\" and then as it bears east along Humboldt Bay, the Highway is aligned on a one-way couplet (4th and 5th streets). Five miles (8.0 km) later the highway leaves Eureka's northern city limit and continues north. The expressway style section between Eureka and Arcata, which is also a safety corridor, is named the \"Michael J. Burns Freeway,\" in honor of the State Senator who was a proponent of California's Highways. The highway becomes an unobstructed freeway south of the center of Arcata. Proceeding north it passes the junction for SR 299 (also the western terminus for that route), in the Valley West (northernmost) part of the college town.\nThe highway continues north as it skirts westerly around McKinleyville on a high bluff north of the Mad River. As the highway reaches Clam Beach (a county park), motorists get their first magnificent full view of the Pacific Ocean north of the Golden Gate. North of Trinidad, the highway narrows to one lane in each direction after crossing Big Lagoon to pass inland of Stone Lagoon and follow the coastal bar between Freshwater Lagoon and the Pacific Ocean south of Orick. It becomes a 14-mile (23 km) undivided freeway through Redwood National and State Parks running inland east of the Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park boundary. The freeway narrows to one lane in each direction at the Klamath River before losing its freeway designation in Klamath. The original placement of the highway near giant Coast Redwoods led to increased awareness of the destruction of the redwoods after decades of extensive logging, which ultimately led to the establishment of Redwood National Park in 1968. The original highway segment through Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park is now a scenic alternate similar to Avenue of the Giants, named Newton B. Drury Scenic Parkway in honor of the fourth director of the National Park Service and executive director of the Save-the-Redwoods League\nNorth of the town of Klamath just inside Del Norte County, the highway closely follows the Pacific coast again. In Crescent City, US 101 once again separates into a one-way couplet (L and M Streets) for nine blocks. As it leaves Crescent City, US 101 becomes a divided freeway for the last time in California (built slightly to the west of the original two-lane alignment, now called Parkway Drive). As the 3-mile divided freeway portion ends, US 101 intersects the southern terminus of US 199, which heads northeast as the Redwood Highway, passing through the Collier Tunnel and terminating in Grants Pass, Oregon. US 101 (no longer called the \"Redwood Highway\" at this point) is reduced to two lanes and continues north along the California coast until it reaches the Oregon border.\n\nTolls\nExpress lanes\nHigh-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes along US 101 between SR 237 in Mountain View and Whipple Avenue in Redwood City opened on February 11, 2022. These express lanes were extended to I-380 in San Bruno on March 3, 2023, and are planned to be extended further south to I-880 in San Jose in Fall 2026.\nAs of August 2022, the HOT lanes' hours of operation is weekdays between 5:00 am and 8:00 pm. Solo drivers are tolled using a congestion pricing system based on the real-time levels of traffic. Two-person carpools and clean air vehicles with a solo driver are charged 50 percent of the posted toll. Carpools with three or more people and motorcycles are not charged. All tolls are collected using an open road tolling system, and therefore there are no toll booths to receive cash. Each vehicle using the HOT lanes is required to carry either a FasTrak Flex or CAV (Clean Air Vehicle) transponder, with its switch set to indicate the number of the vehicle's occupants (1, 2, or 3 or more). Solo drivers may also use the FasTrak standard tag without the switch. Drivers without any FasTrak tag will be assessed a toll violation regardless of whether they qualified for free.\nThe segment of the express lanes in Santa Clara County is co-administered by the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) while the segment in San Mateo County is co-administered by the separate San Mateo County Express Lanes Joint Powers Authority, and so drivers will see separate toll charges when using each segment.\n\nGolden Gate Bridge\nTolls are collected only for southbound traffic on the Golden Gate Bridge headed to San Francisco. Fully electronic tolling is also used on the bridge, and they can be paid by either a FasTrak transponder or license plate tolling. The high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane leading to the bridge requires a car with three or more people.\n\nHistory\nJuan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail\nThe US 101 Highway is part of the auto tour route of the Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail, a National Park Service unit in the United States National Historic Trail and National Millennium Trail programs.  In 2005, Caltrans began posting signs on roads that overlap with the historic 1776 Juan Bautista de Anza trail route, so that California drivers can now follow the trail.\n\nHistoric route: San Diego to Los Angeles\nInstead of terminating in Los Angeles, US 101 once continued all the way south through San Diego to the Mexico\u2013United States border in San Ysidro. However, this part was decommissioned on July 1, 1964, in favor of I-5. Though much of U.S. Route 101 has been superseded by I-5, several street segments of former Route 101 exist.\n\nHistoric route in San Diego County\nMuch of the route in northern San Diego County is County Route S21; this includes Coast Highway in Oceanside, Carlsbad Boulevard in Carlsbad, Coast Highway 101 in Encinitas, Camino del Mar in Del Mar, and Torrey Pines Road in Torrey Pines.  In San Diego, one alignment entered La Jolla Village on La Jolla Blvd, while a newer alignment went through Rose Canyon under what is now I-5.  Roads followed by US-101 in San Diego included Mission Bay Drive, Pacific Hwy, Harbor Drive and Main Street.  It ran along National City Blvd in National City, Broadway in Chula Vista and Beyer Blvd in San Ysidro.\n\nOceanside\u2013Carlsbad freeway bypass\nBy the early 1950s, traffic had become very heavy on US 101 through Oceanside and Carlsbad. The US 101 freeway bypass (Oceanside-Carlsbad freeway bypass) was built in 1953 and completed in 1955 by the California Department of Public Works (now Caltrans) and brought up by the San Diego Highway Development Association on a US 80\/US 101 discussion on how to resolve the huge traffic loads on US 101 in Oceanside. Today it is part of I-5 and Palomar Airport Road. It follows I-5 from Coast Highway (former Hill Street exit) in Oceanside to Palomar Airport Road in Carlsbad. From there the US 101 bypass went onto Palomar Airport Road to merge with US 101 Bus. on Carlsbad Boulevard. As it approached the Coast Highway\/SR 76 exit on southbound I-5 in Oceanside, US 101 Bus. split off. US 101 Bus. followed the original US 101 through downtown Oceanside and Carlsbad as former Hill Street\/Carlsbad Boulevard (CR S-21) while the US 101 freeway followed modern I-5 and Palomar Airport Road. The south end of the freeway bypass is Carlsbad Boulevard and Palomar Airport Road and the north end is I-5 and the Coast Highway\/SR 76 exit. The south end was modified after US 101 was decommissioned between the East Los Angeles Interchange in Los Angeles and the Mexican border in San Ysidro. This freeway construction by the California Department of Public Works put US 101 on an all new highway route alignment to relieve Oceanside and Carlsbad of their very heavy bumper-to-bumper burdensome traffic problem. Also before the bypass in the 1950s, US 101 followed North Coast Highway (formerly Hill Street) from San Luis Rey Mission Expressway (SR 76 and north end of the Oceanside\u2013Carlsbad freeway bypass) to Harbor Drive. From there it followed Harbor Drive to Vandergrift Boulevard, San Rafael Drive, and the freeway onramp for I-5 north near the Camp Pendleton north entrance guardhouse gate. It merges with the I-5 northbound onramp to shoot onto the southbound lanes of I-5 to follow the freeway lanes all the way to Las Pulgas Road in Camp Pendleton.\n\nHistoric route in Orange and Los Angeles Counties\nAn old orphaned alignment of US 101, that ran through the cities of Mission Viejo, Laguna Niguel, San Juan Capistrano, Dana Point, and San Clemente, was located in south Orange County. The old roadway, from a dead end just west of I-5 and east of the railroad tracks in Mission Viejo to Cristianitos Road in San Clemente, followed Camino Capistrano, Doheny Park Road, Coast Highway and El Camino Real. It had interchanges with I-5 and California State Route 1. It was replaced by the San Diego freeway (which US 101 became part of it in 1958) and finally replaced by I-5 in 1968.\nIn northern Orange County, US 101 followed Harbor Boulevard.  U.S. Route 101 left Orange County, traversed southeast Los Angeles County, and entered the City of Los Angeles along Whittier Boulevard.\n\nEl Camino Real: Los Angeles to San Francisco\nSignificant portions of US 101 from its southern terminus to the San Francisco Bay Area is designated as the Royal Road or El Camino Real. The commemorative route connects the former Alta California's 21 missions.\nA former route of the highway over the Gabilan Range on the San Juan Grade to San Juan Bautista was bypassed in a 1932 realignment. Instead, shortly after leaving Salinas, US 101 joins SR 156 in Prunedale for about eight miles (13 km) as it crosses the mountains further north, through the Prunedale Cutoff. \nBefore the Golden Gate Bridge was completed in 1937, there was regular vehicle ferry service across the Golden Gate strait, running from the Hyde Street Pier to  Sausalito. Under the California Streets and Highways Code \u00a7 401, the Golden Gate Bridge is legally not part of US 101. The portion of US 101 starting from Los Angeles ends at \"the approach to the Golden Gate Bridge\" and then resumes at \"a point in Marin County opposite San Francisco\" to the Oregon state line. The bridge itself is maintained by the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District instead of Caltrans.\nFrom the 1940s to 1991, various segments of US 101 between Los Angeles and San Francisco were upgraded to either a freeway or expressway. In the Los Angeles area, the first segment of the Hollywood Freeway through the Cahuenga Pass opened in 1940, while the segment from the San Fernando Valley to Downtown Los Angeles opened in 1954, replacing Cahuenga Boulevard. The Ventura Freeway then opened in 1960, replacing Ventura Boulevard. The segment of the original two-lane alignment between Emma Wood State Beach north to the Mobil Pier Undercrossing near Sea Cliff, which followed the historic Rincon Sea Level Road, was the re-signed as part of SR 1.\nThe last traffic signals along the route between the Los Angeles area and the San Francisco Bay Area were removed in 1991 when the section through downtown Santa Barbara was constructed to freeway standards after years of disagreement over the impact that the original elevated design would have on the community.\nIn the San Francisco Bay Area, US 101 was originally divided. US 101W followed the same general right-of-way of today's US 101 through the region, primarily along what was originally signed as Bayshore Boulevard. US 101E then generally followed the right-of-way taken by today's I-880 from San Jose to Oakland, then across the Carquinez Bridge to follow what is now SR 37, joining US 101W. The US 101E designation was removed by the 1940s and became SR 17 (later designated as I-880 and the westernmost section I-580), running from San Jose to Oakland and then across the Richmond\u2013San Rafael Bridge. Meanwhile, Bayshore Boulevard was later redesignated as the US 101A bypass and then eventually upgraded to what is now the Bayshore Freeway. The first stretch that was completed between Redwood City and South San Francisco was the Bay Area's first freeway when it opened in 1947. After the entire Bayshore Freeway was completed in the early 1960s, the old alignment along the peninsula was renumbered and renamed as SR 82\/El Camino Real.\nVarious other freeway or expressway bypasses along the California Central Coast were also built. In 1991, the last traffic signal along US 101 between Los Angeles and San Francisco was taken down in Santa Barbara. The primary control city that is listed on freeway signs along northbound US 101 through the Central Coast region remains San Francisco.\nAs the result of freeway revolts in San Francisco in the 1950s, a direct freeway connection through the city to the Golden Gate Bridge has never been built. The Central Freeway was completed to extend from the Bayshore Freeway to Turk Street in 1959, before the San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted to remove the remainder of the Central Freeway and most other proposed freeways from the city's highway plan. For decades, southbound traffic on US 101 flowed on the one-way Turk Street from Van Ness Avenue to the Central Freeway, while northbound traffic used the parallel Golden Gate Avenue. After the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake damaged the structure, the segment of the Central Freeway north of Market Street was replaced with the surface-level Octavia Boulevard; traffic on US 101 was then eventually re-routed to exit south of that at Mission Street\/South Van Ness Avenue. With no direct freeway along US 101 through the City of San Francisco, the old US 101E\/I-880\/I-580 route remains as a faster bypass through the Bay Area.\nIn the wake of the dot-com bubble expansion, the segment of US 101 between Morgan Hill and San Jose, also known as the Sig Sanchez Freeway, expanded to eight lanes between Cochrane Road and SR 85 exits between 2001 and 2003 and a new interchange at Bailey Avenue, which had been planned since the 1970s, opened in 2004. Originally, the ten-mile  segment (16 km) was only four lanes (it was planned to have six lanes when opened in 1984). The rebuilt segment was to alleviate the consistent congestion that had expanded as far south as Masten Avenue coming from Gilroy, and as far north as Bernal Road coming from San Jose. Traffic now typically only runs slow between the Bailey Avenue and East Dunne Avenue exits.\n\nThe interchange at the beginning of I-280 and I-680 in San Jose was constructed years before its completion. The three flyovers, with no on ramps or off ramps connecting them stood at 110-foot-tall (34 m) over US 101 for years in the 1970s (the SR 87\/I-280 interchange also had this at the same time). It became the butt of many local jokes. The highlight prank occurred in January 1976, when a 1960 Chevrolet Impala was placed on the highest bridge overnight, where it obviously would be impossible to drive. The following day, San Jose City Councilman Joe Colla was photographed standing next to the car, a photo which was circulated across many newspapers. It has been suggested this stunt helped lead to funding to complete the freeway. In 2010, the interchange was named the Joe Colla Interchange.\n\nRedwood Highway: Marin County to Del Norte County\nAn abandoned segment of the Redwood Highway, US 101, located in the Redwood National and State Parks near Klamath was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.\nFreeway segments along the Redwood Highway portion of US 101 are not as prevalent as along the Los Angeles-San Francisco route. A notable segment of the old US 101 alignment is SR 254, also known as the Avenue of the Giants, in Humboldt Redwoods State Park. The freeway bypassing this scenic route, surrounded by towering Coast Redwoods, was completed in 1960. Several bridges along the segment of highway running along the Eel River were destroyed during the Christmas flood of 1964.\nA freeway bypass of Cloverdale was constructed in the early 1990s, requiring the relocation of segments of the Northwestern Pacific Railroad. The new 4-mile-long (6.4 km) roadway along with new frontages and relocated railroad were completed at a cost of $40 million ($82.2 million in 2023 adjusted for inflation). The highway opened over two weeks in March 1994. The old routing through town is on Cloverdale Boulevard.\nConstruction on a freeway segment bypassing Willits began in 2013. The bypass around Willits remained controversial because the intended route goes through protected wetlands. Construction was halted by US Army Corps of Engineers in June 2014 and work restarted the following month after Caltrans committed to extensive mitigation of the project. The 5.9 mi (9.5 km) bypass around Willits opened to traffic in November 2016. The bypass included a 1.1 mi (1.8 km) viaduct going over a flood plain. The freeway segment cost $459 million to complete ($583 million in 2023 adjusted for inflation), 50% more than what Caltrans first reported when it opened. \nThe city of Eureka has long resisted a freeway through it.\n\nFuture\nThe Wallis Annenberg Wildlife Crossing is a vegetated overpass spanning the Ventura Freeway and Agoura Road at Liberty Canyon in Agoura Hills. Once built, it will be one of the largest urban wildlife crossings in the United States, connecting the Simi Hills and the Santa Monica Mountains over a busy freeway with ten traffic lanes (including exit lanes).\nThe Richardson Grove section of US 101 has been proposed for a bypass for many years, but Caltrans conducted a study in 2000 which stated that a bypass was not cost effective and recommended realignment of US 101 within the redwood grove instead to accommodate modern-sized trucks in compliance with the Surface Transportation Assistance Act (STAA).\n\nNames and memorials\nUrban portions of the route in Southern California are named the Santa Ana Freeway, Hollywood Freeway, and Ventura Freeway at various points between East Los Angeles and Carpinteria, California. In 2008, the portion of US 101 that runs from the Conejo Grade to the Old Town district of Camarillo was dedicated as the Adolfo Camarillo Memorial Highway to honor the city's namesake and extends through the boundaries of the original Camarillo family ranch. In 2003, the portion of US 101 in Ventura County was named Screaming Eagles Highway in honor of the US Army 101st Airborne Division. Urban portions of the route in the Bay Area are called the James Lick Freeway, Bayshore Freeway, and Central Freeway. A portion of the route between Cochrane Road in Morgan Hill and SR 85 in San Jose is named the Sig Sanchez Freeway. The section of highway between SR 85 in Mountain View and Embarcadero Road in Palo Alto is officially known as the Frederick E. Terman Highway. Street routings in San Francisco are more commonly referred to by their street names rather than the route number. Portions of the route between Southern California and the Bay Area are named El Camino Real or El Camino Real Freeway, but such names are rarely used colloquially; the route number is used instead. In Northern California the section of US 101 between Sonoma and Marin counties is often referred to as the Novato Narrows because of the reduction from six lanes to four.\n\nMajor intersections\nExcept where prefixed with a letter, postmiles were measured on the road as it was in 1964, based on the alignment that existed at the time, and do not necessarily reflect current mileage. R reflects a realignment in the route since then, M indicates a second realignment, L refers to an overlap due to a correction or change, and T indicates postmiles classified as temporary (for a full list of prefixes, see California postmile \u00a7 Official postmile definitions). Segments that remain unconstructed or have been relinquished to local control may be omitted. The numbers reset at county lines; the start and end postmiles in each county are given in the county column.\n\nSee also\nCalifornia Roads portal\n National Register of Historic Places portal\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nCaltrans: US 101 highway conditions\nCaltrans Traffic Conditions Map\nCalifornia Highway Patrol Traffic Incidents\nBay Area FasTrak \u2013 includes toll information on the US 101 Express Lanes, the Golden Gate Bridge and the other Bay Area toll facilities\nDrive the 101: historical information website\nCalifornia @ AARoads.com \u2013 U.S. Route 101\nCalifornia Highways: US 101","221":"Traffic congestion is a condition in transport that is characterized by slower speeds, longer trip times, and increased vehicular queueing. Traffic congestion on urban road networks has increased substantially since the 1950s. When traffic demand is great enough that the interaction between vehicles slows the traffic stream, this results in congestion. While congestion is a possibility for any mode of transportation, this article will focus on automobile congestion on public roads.\nAs demand approaches the capacity of a road (or of the intersections along the road), extreme traffic congestion sets in. When vehicles are fully stopped for periods of time, this is  known as a traffic jam or (informally) a traffic snarl-up or a tailback.\nDrivers can become frustrated and engage in road rage. Drivers and driver-focused road planning departments commonly propose to alleviate congestion by adding another lane to the road. This is ineffective: increasing road capacity induces more demand for driving.\nMathematically, traffic is modeled as a flow through a fixed point on the route, analogously to fluid dynamics.\n\nCauses\nTraffic congestion occurs when a volume of traffic generates demand for space greater than the available street capacity; this point is commonly termed saturation.  Several specific circumstances can cause or aggravate congestion; most of them reduce the capacity of a road at a given point or over a certain length, or increase the number of vehicles required for a given volume of people or goods.  About half of U.S. traffic congestion is recurring, and is attributed to sheer weight of traffic; most of the rest is attributed to traffic incidents, road work and weather events. In terms of traffic operation, rainfall reduces traffic capacity and operating speeds, thereby resulting in greater congestion and road network productivity loss.\nIndividual incidents such as crashes or even a single car braking heavily in a previously smooth flow may cause ripple effects, a cascading failure, which then spread out and create a sustained traffic jam when, otherwise, the normal flow might have continued for some time longer.\n\nSeparation of work and residential areas\nPeople often work and live in different parts of the city. Many workplaces are located in a central business district away from residential areas, resulting in workers commuting. According to a 2011 report published by the United States Census Bureau, a total of 132.3 million people in the United States commute between their work and residential areas daily.\n\nMovement to obtain or provide goods and services\nPeople may need to move about within the city to obtain goods and services, for instance to purchase goods or attend classes in a different part of the city. Brussels, a Belgian city with a strong service economy, has one of the worst traffic congestion in the world, wasting 74 hours in traffic in 2014.\n\nMathematical theories\nSome traffic engineers have attempted to apply the rules of fluid dynamics to traffic flow,  likening it to the flow of a fluid in a pipe. Congestion simulations and real-time observations have shown that in heavy but free flowing traffic, jams can arise spontaneously, triggered by minor events (\"butterfly effects\"), such as an abrupt steering maneuver by a single motorist. Traffic scientists liken such a situation to the sudden freezing of supercooled fluid.\nHowever, unlike a fluid, traffic flow is often affected by signals or other events at junctions that periodically affect the smooth flow of traffic.  Alternative mathematical theories exist, such as Boris Kerner's three-phase traffic theory (see also spatiotemporal reconstruction of traffic congestion).\nBecause of the poor correlation of theoretical models to actual observed traffic flows, transportation planners and highway engineers attempt to forecast traffic flow using empirical models. Their working traffic models typically use a combination of macro-, micro- and mesoscopic features, and may add matrix entropy effects, by \"platooning\" groups of vehicles and by randomizing the flow patterns within individual segments of the network. These models are then typically calibrated by measuring actual traffic flows on the links in the network, and the baseline flows are adjusted accordingly.\nA team of MIT mathematicians has developed a model that describes the formation of \"phantom jams\", in which small disturbances (a driver hitting the brake too hard, or getting too close to another car) in heavy traffic can become amplified into a full-blown, self-sustaining traffic jam. Key to the study is the realization that the mathematics of such jams, which the researchers call \"jamitons\", are strikingly similar to the equations that describe detonation waves produced by explosions, says Aslan Kasimov, lecturer in MIT's Department of Mathematics. That discovery enabled the team to solve traffic-jam equations that were first theorized in the 1950s.\n\nEconomic theories\nCongested roads can be seen as an example of the tragedy of the commons. Because roads in most places are free at the point of usage, there is little financial incentive for drivers not to over-use them, up to the point where traffic collapses into a jam, when demand becomes limited by opportunity cost. Privatization of highways and road pricing have both been proposed as measures that may reduce congestion through economic incentives and disincentives . Congestion can also happen due to non-recurring highway incidents, such as a crash or roadworks, which may reduce the road's capacity below normal levels.\n\nEconomist Anthony Downs argues that rush hour traffic congestion is inevitable because of the benefits of having a relatively standard work day . In a capitalist economy, goods can be allocated either by pricing (ability to pay) or by queueing (first-come first-served); congestion is an example of the latter. Instead of the traditional solution of making the \"pipe\" large enough to accommodate the total demand for peak-hour vehicle travel (a supply-side solution), either by widening roadways or increasing \"flow pressure\" via automated highway systems, Downs advocates greater use of road pricing to reduce congestion (a demand-side solution, effectively rationing demand), in turn plowing the revenues generated therefrom into public transportation projects.\nA 2011 study in The American Economic Review indicates that there may be a \"fundamental law of road congestion.\" The researchers, from the  University of Toronto and the London School of Economics, analyzed data from the U.S. Highway Performance and Monitoring System for 1983, 1993 and 2003, as well as information on population, employment, geography, transit, and political factors. They determined that the number of vehicle-kilometers traveled (VKT) increases in direct proportion to the available lane-kilometers of roadways. The implication is that building new roads and widening existing ones only results in additional traffic that continues to rise until peak congestion returns to the previous level.\n\nClassification\nQualitative classification of traffic is often done in the form of a six-letter A-F level of service (LOS) scale defined in the Highway Capacity Manual, a US document used (or used as a basis for national guidelines) worldwide. These levels are used by transportation engineers as a shorthand and to describe traffic levels to the lay public. While this system generally uses delay as the basis for its measurements, the particular measurements and statistical methods vary depending on the facility being described. For instance, while the percent time spent following a slower-moving vehicle figures into the LOS for a rural two-lane road, the LOS at an urban intersection incorporates such measurements as the number of drivers forced to wait through more than one signal cycle.\nTraffic congestion occurs in time and space, i.e., it is a spatiotemporal process. Therefore, another classification schema of traffic congestion is associated with some common spatiotemporal features of traffic congestion found in measured traffic data. Common spatiotemporal empirical features of traffic congestion are those features, which are qualitatively the same for different highways in different countries measured during years of traffic observations. Common features of traffic congestion are independent on weather, road conditions and road infrastructure, vehicular technology, driver characteristics, day time, etc. Examples of common features of traffic congestion are the features [J] and [S] for, respectively, the wide moving jam and synchronized flow traffic phases found in Kerner's three-phase traffic theory. The common features of traffic congestion can be reconstructed in space and time with the use of the ASDA and FOTO models.\n\nNegative impacts\nTraffic congestion has a number of negative effects:\n\nWasting time of motorists and passengers (\"opportunity cost\"). As a non-productive activity for most people, congestion reduces regional economic health.\nDelays, which may result in late arrival for employment, meetings, and education, resulting in lost business, disciplinary action or other personal losses.\nInability to forecast travel time accurately, leading to drivers allocating more time to travel \"just in case\", and less time on productive activities.\nWasted fuel increasing air pollution and carbon dioxide emissions owing to increased idling, acceleration and braking.\nWear and tear on vehicles as a result of idling in traffic and frequent acceleration and braking, leading to more frequent repairs and replacements.\nStressed and frustrated motorists, encouraging road rage and reduced health of motorists\nEmergencies: blocked traffic may interfere with the passage of emergency vehicles traveling to their destinations where they are urgently needed.\nSpillover effect from congested main arteries to secondary roads and side streets as alternative routes are attempted ('rat running'), which may affect neighborhood amenity and real estate prices.\nHigher chance of collisions due to tight spacing and constant stopping-and-going.\n\nRoad rage\nRoad rage is aggressive or angry behavior by a driver of an automobile or other motor vehicle. Such behavior might include rude gestures, verbal insults, deliberately driving in an unsafe or threatening manner, or making threats. Road rage can lead to altercations, assaults, and collisions which result in injuries and even deaths. It can be thought of as an extreme case of aggressive driving.The term originated in the United States in 1987\u20131988 (specifically, from Newscasters at KTLA, a local television station), when a rash of freeway shootings occurred on the 405, 110 and 10 freeways in Los Angeles, California. These shooting sprees even spawned a response from the AAA Motor Club to its members on how to respond to drivers with road rage or aggressive maneuvers and gestures.\n\nEconomic loss\nPositive effects\nCongestion has the benefit of encouraging motorists to retime their trips so that expensive road space is in full use for more hours per day. It may also encourage travellers to pick alternate modes with a lower environmental impact, such as public transport or bicycles.\nIt has been argued that traffic congestion, by reducing road speeds in cities, could reduce the frequency and severity of road crashes. More recent research suggests that a U-curve exists between the number of accidents and the flow of traffic, implying that more accidents happen not only at high congestion levels, but also when there are very few vehicles on the road.\n\nCountermeasures\nImproving Road infrastructure\nIncreasing road capacity is standard response to congestion, perhaps by widening an existing road or adding a new road, bridge or tunnel. However, this has been shown to result in attracting more traffic, otherwise known as induced demand.  The result can be  greater congestion on the expanded artery itself or on auxiliary roads. In a similar vein, Braess's paradox shows that adding road capacity might make congestion worse, even if demand does not increase. In his paper, \"The Law of Peak Hour Express Way Congestion\", published in 1962, Anthony Downs formulated this phenomenon as a \"law\": \u201con urban commuter expressways, peak-hour traffic congestion rises to meet maximum capacity.\u201d\nJunction improvements\nGrade separation, using bridges (or, less often, tunnels) freeing movements from having to stop for other crossing movements\nRamp signaling, 'drip-feeding' merging traffic via traffic signals onto a congested motorway-type roadway\nReducing junctions\nLocal-express lanes, providing through lanes that bypass junction on-ramp and off-ramp zones\nLimited-access road, roads that limit the type and amounts of driveways along their lengths\nReversible lanes, where certain sections of highway operate in the opposite direction on different times of the day(s) of the week, to match asymmetric demand. These pose a potential for collisions, if drivers do not notice the change in direction indicators. This may be controlled by variable-message signs or by movable physical separation\nSeparate lanes for specific user groups (usually with the goal of higher people throughput with fewer vehicles)\nBus lanes as part of a busway system\nExpress toll lanes\nHOV lanes, for vehicles with at least three (sometimes at least two) riders, intended to encourage carpooling\nSlugging, impromptu carpooling at HOV access points, on a hitchhiking or payment basis\nMarket-based carpooling with pre-negotiated financial incentives for the driver\n\nUrban planning and design\nCity planning and urban design practices can have a huge impact on levels of future traffic congestion, though they are of limited relevance for short-term change.\n\nGrid plans including fused grid road network geometry, rather than tree-like network topology which branches into cul-de-sacs (which reduce local traffic, but increase total distances driven and discourage walking by reducing connectivity). This avoids concentration of traffic on a small number of arterial roads and allows more trips to be made without a car.\nZoning laws that encourage mixed-use development, which reduces distances between residential, commercial, retail, and recreational destinations and encourage cycling and walking. Cycling modal share is strongly associated with the availability of local cycling infrastructure.\nCarfree cities, car-light cities, and eco-cities designed to eliminate the need to travel by car for most inhabitants.\nTransit-oriented development are residential and commercial areas designed to maximize access to public transport by providing a transit station or stop (train station, metro station, tram stop, or bus stop).\n\nSupply and demand\nCongestion can be reduced by either increasing road capacity (supply), or by reducing traffic (demand). Capacity can be increased in a number of ways, but needs to take account of latent demand otherwise it may be used more strongly than anticipated. Critics of the approach of adding capacity have compared it to \"fighting obesity by letting out your belt\" (inducing demand that did not exist before). For example, when new lanes are created, households with a second car that used to be parked most of the time may begin to use this second car for commuting. Reducing road capacity has in turn been attacked as removing free choice as well as increasing travel costs and times, placing an especially high burden on the low income residents who must commute to work.\nIncreased supply can include:\n\nAdding more capacity at bottlenecks (such as by adding more lanes at the expense of hard shoulders or safety zones, or by removing local obstacles like bridge supports and widening tunnels)\nAdding more capacity over the whole of a route (generally by adding more lanes)\nCreating new routes\nTraffic management improvements (see separate section below)\nReduction of demand can include:\n\nParking restrictions, making motor vehicle use less attractive by increasing the monetary and non-monetary costs of parking, introducing greater competition for limited city or road space. Most transport planning experts agree that free parking distorts the market in favor of car travel, exacerbating congestion.\nPark and ride facilities allowing parking at a distance and allowing continuation by public transport or ride sharing. Park-and-ride car parks are commonly found at metro stations,  freeway entrances in suburban areas, and at the edge of smaller cities.\nReduction of road capacity to force traffic onto other travel modes. Methods include traffic calming and the shared space concept.\nRoad pricing, charging money for access onto a road\/specific area at certain times, congestion levels or for certain road users\n\"Cap and trade\", in which only licensed cars are allowed on the roads. A limited quota of car licenses are issued each year and traded in a free market fashion. This guarantees that the number of cars does not exceed road capacity while avoiding the negative effects of shortages normally associated with quotas. However, since demand for cars tends to be inelastic, the result are exorbitant purchase prices for the licenses, pricing out the lower levels of society, as seen Singapore's Certificate of Entitlement scheme.\nCongestion pricing, including:\nCongestion zone charges - a certain area, such as the inner part of a congested city, is surrounded with a cordon into which entry with a car requires payment. The cordon may be a physical boundary (i.e., surrounded by toll stations) or it may be virtual, with enforcement being via spot checks or cameras on the entry routes. Major examples are Singapore's electronic road pricing, the London congestion charge system, Stockholm congestion tax\nFixed (the same at all times of day), variable (higher at peak times), or dynamic (higher during actual congestion) toll roads, toll bridges, toll tunnels, and toll lanes\nManaged lanes\nHigh-occupancy toll lanes\nReversible lanes\nHigh-occupancy vehicle lanes\nBus lanes\nTruck lane restrictions and climbing lanes, to allow faster vehicles to move unimpeded\nAllowing driving on highway shoulders at peak times\nRoad space rationing, where regulatory restrictions prevent certain types of vehicles from driving under certain circumstances or in certain areas.\nNumber plate restrictions based on days of the week, as practiced in several large cities in the world, such as Athens, Mexico City, Manila and S\u00e3o Paulo. In effect, such cities are banning a different part of the automobile fleet from roads each day of the week. Mainly introduced to combat smog, these measures also reduce congestion. A weakness of this method is that richer drivers can purchase a second or third car to circumvent the ban.\nPermits, where only certain types of vehicles (such as residents) are permitted to enter a certain area, and other types (such as through-traffic) are banned. For example, Bertrand Delano\u00eb, the mayor of Paris, has proposed to impose a complete ban on motor vehicles in the city's inner districts, with exemptions only for residents, businesses, and the disabled.\n\nPolicy approaches, which usually attempt to provide either strategic alternatives or which encourage greater usage of existing alternatives through promotion, subsidies or restrictions.\nIncentives to use public transport, increasing modal shares. This can be achieved through infrastructure investment, subsidies, transport integration, pricing strategies that decrease the marginal cost\/fixed cost ratios, improved timetabling and greater priority for buses to reduce journey time e.g. bus lanes or bus rapid transit .\nCycling promotion through legislation, cycle facilities, subsidies, and awareness campaigns. The Netherlands has been pursuing cycle friendly policies for decades, and around a quarter of their commuting is done by bicycle.\nPromotion of more flexible work place practices. For example, a flexible workplaces pilot was undertaken in Brisbane, Australia during 2009 to test the applicability of a voluntary travel behavior change program to achieve transport system outcomes, particularly as they related to managing congestion, either through mode shift or peak spreading. During the one-month Pilot, amongst almost 900 Brisbane CBD workers across 20 private and public sector organizations, shifts of more than 30% out of the morning and afternoon peak travel was recorded.\nRemote work encouraged through legislation and subsidies.\nOnline shopping promotion, potentially with automated delivery booths helping to solve the last mile problem and reduce shopping trips made by car.\n\nTraffic management\nUse of so-called intelligent transportation systems, which guide traffic:\n\nTraffic reporting, via radio, GPS and mobile apps, to advise road users\nVariable message signs installed along the roadway, to advise road users\nNavigation systems, possibly linked up to automatic traffic reporting\nTraffic counters permanently installed, to provide real-time traffic counts\nAutomated highway systems, a future idea which could reduce the safe interval between cars (required for braking in emergencies) and increase highway capacity by as much as 100% while increasing travel speeds\nParking guidance and information systems providing dynamic advice to motorists about free parking\nActive traffic management system opens up UK motorway hard shoulder as an extra traffic lane; it uses CCTV and VMS to control and monitor the traffic's use of the extra lane.\n\nOther associated\nSchool opening times arranged to avoid rush hour traffic (in some countries, private car school pickup and drop-off traffic are substantial percentages of peak hour traffic).\nConsiderate driving behavior promotion and enforcement. Driving practices such as tailgating, frequent lane changes, and impeding the flow of traffic can reduce a road's capacity and exacerbate jams. In some countries signs are placed on highways to raise awareness, while others have introduced legislation against inconsiderate driving.\nVisual barriers to prevent drivers from slowing down out of curiosity (often called \"rubbernecking\" in the United States). This often includes crashes, with traffic slowing down even on roadsides physically separated from the crash location. This also tends to occur at construction sites, which is why some countries have introduced rules that motorway construction has to occur behind visual barrier\nSpeed limit reductions, as practiced on the M25 motorway in London. With lower speeds allowing cars to drive closer together, this increases the capacity of a road. Note that this measure is only effective if the interval between cars is reduced, not the distance itself. Low intervals are generally only safe at low speeds.\nLane splitting\/filtering, in which some jurisdictions allow motorcycles, scooters and bicycles to travel in the space between cars, buses, and trucks.\nReduction of road freight avoiding problems such as double parking with innovative solutions including cargo bicycles and Gothenburg's Stadsleveransens.\nReducing the quantity of cars that are on the road, i.e. through proof-of-parking requirements, circulation plans, corporate car sharing, bans on on-street parking or by increasing the costs of car ownership\n\nBy country\nAustralia\nTraffic during peak hours in major Australian cities, such as Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth, is usually very congested and can cause considerable delay for motorists. Australians rely mainly on radio and television to obtain current traffic information. GPS, webcams, and online resources are increasingly being used to monitor and relay traffic conditions to motorists.\n\nBangladesh\nTraffic jams have become intolerable in Dhaka. Some other major reasons are the total absence of a rapid transit system; the lack of an integrated urban planning scheme for over 30 years; poorly maintained road surfaces, with potholes rapidly eroded further by frequent flooding and poor or non-existent drainage; haphazard stopping and parking; poor driving standards; total lack of alternative routes, with several narrow and (nominally) one-way roads.\n\nBrazil\nAccording to Time magazine, S\u00e3o Paulo has the world's worst daily traffic jams. Based on reports from the Companhia de Engenharia de Tr\u00e1fego, the city's traffic management agency, the historical congestion record was set on May 23, 2014, with 344 kilometres (214 mi) of cumulative queues around the city during the evening rush hour.  The previous record occurred on November 14, 2013, with 309 kilometres (192 mi) of cumulative queues.\nDespite implementation since 1997 of road space rationing by the last digit of the plate number during rush hours every weekday, traffic in this 20-million-strong city still experiences severe congestion. According to experts, this is due to the accelerated rate of motorization occurring since 2003 and the limited capacity of public transport. In S\u00e3o Paulo, traffic is growing at a rate of 7.5% per year, with almost 1,000 new cars bought in the city every day.  The subway has only 61 kilometres (38 mi) of lines, though 35 further kilometers are under construction or planned by 2010. Every day, many citizens spend between three up to four hours behind the wheel. In order to mitigate the aggravating congestion problem, since June 30, 2008, the road space rationing program was expanded to include and restrict trucks and light commercial vehicles.\n\nCanada\nAccording to the Toronto Board of Trade, in 2010, Toronto is ranked as the most congested city of 19 surveyed cities, with an average commute time of 80 minutes.\n\nChina\nThe Chinese city of Beijing started a license plate rationing since the 2008 Summer Olympics whereby each car is banned from the urban core one workday per week, depending on the last digit of its license plate. As of 2016, 11 major Chinese cities have implemented similar policies. Towards the end of 2010, Beijing announced a series of drastic measures to tackle the city's chronic traffic congestion, such as limiting the number of new plates issued to passenger cars to 20,000 a month, barring vehicles with non-Beijing plates from entering areas within the Fifth Ring Road during rush hours and expanding its subway system. The government aims to cap the number of locally registered cars in Beijing to below 6.3 million by the end of 2020. In addition, more than nine major Chinese cities including Shanghai, Guangzhou and Hangzhou started limiting the number of new plates issued to passenger cars in an attempt to curb the growth of car ownership. In response to the increased demand to public transit caused by these policies, aggressive programs to rapidly expand public transport systems in many Chinese cities are currently underway.\nA unique Chinese phenomenon of severe traffic congestion occurs during Chunyun Period or Spring Festival travel season. It is a long-held tradition for most Chinese people to reunite with their families during Chinese New Year. People return to their hometown to have a reunion dinner with their families on Chinese New Year. It has been described as the largest annual human migration in the world. Since the economic boom and rapid urbanization of China since the late 1970s, many people work and study a considerable distance from their hometowns. Traffic flow is typically directional, with large amounts of the population working in more developed coastal provinces needing travel to their hometowns in the less developed interior. The process reverses near the end of Chunyun. With almost 3 billion trips made in 40 days of the 2016 Chunyun Period, the Chinese intercity transportation network is extremely strained during this period.\nThe August 2010 China National Highway 110 traffic jam in Hebei province caught media attention for its severity, stretching more than 100 kilometres (62 mi) from August 14 to 26, including at least 11 days of total gridlock. The event was caused by a combination of road works and thousands of coal trucks from Inner Mongolia's coalfields that travel daily to Beijing. The New York Times has called this event the \"Great Chinese Gridlock of 2010.\" The congestion is regarded as the worst in history by duration, and is one of the longest in length after the 175 kilometres (109 mi) long Lyon-Paris traffic jam in France on February 16, 1980.\nRecently, in Hangzhou City Brain has become active, reducing traffic congestion somewhat.\nA 2021 study of subway constructions in China found that in the first year of a new subway line, road congestion declined.\n\nGreece\nSince the 70s, the traffic on the streets of Athens has increased dramatically, with the existing road network unable to serve the ever-increasing demand. In addition, it has also caused an environmental burden, such as the photochemical smog. To deal with it, the Daktylios has been enforced.\n\nIndia\nThe number of vehicles in India is quickly increasing as a growing middle class can now afford to buy cars. India's road conditions have not kept up with the exponential growth in number of vehicles.\nVarious causes for this include:\n\nPrivate encroachments\nNon cooperation among drivers\nUnscientific road design\nLack of free ways\/exit ways where local roads and main roads intersect\nLack of demarcated footpaths\nLack of bus bays\nLack of cycle tracks\nLack of coordination among various government departments (e.g. digging of roads by telecom\/water department and leaving it open)\n\nIndonesia\nAccording to a 2015 study by motor oil company Castrol, Jakarta is found to be the worst city in the world for traffic congestion. Relying on information from TomTom navigation devices in 78 countries, the index found that drivers are stopping and starting their cars 33,240 times per year on the road. After Jakarta, the worst cities for traffic are Istanbul, Mexico City, Surabaya, and St. Petersburg.\nDaily congestion in Jakarta is not a recent problem. The expansion of commercial area without road expansion shows worsening daily congestion even in main roads such as Jalan Jenderal Sudirman, Jalan M.H. Thamrin, and Jalan Gajah Mada in the mid-1970s.\nIn 2016, 22 people died as a result of traffic congestion in Java. They were among those stuck in a three-day traffic jam at a toll exit in Brebes, Central Java called Brebes Exit or 'Brexit'. The traffic block stretched for 21 km here and thousands of cars clogged the highway. Many people died because of carbon monoxide poisoning, fatigue or heat.\n\nNew Zealand\nNew Zealand has followed strongly car-oriented transport policies since after World War II (especially in Auckland, where one third of the country's population lives, is New Zealand's most traffic congested city, and has been labeled worse than New York for traffic congestion with commuters sitting in traffic congestion for 95 hours per year), and currently has one of the highest car-ownership rates per capita in the world, after the United States. Traffic congestion in New Zealand is increasing with drivers on New Zealand's motorways reported to be struggling to exceed 20 km\/h on an average commute, sometimes crawling along at 8 km\/h for more than half an hour.\n\nPhilippines\nAccording to a survey by Waze, traffic congestion in Metro Manila is called the \"worst\" in the world, after Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo, and Jakarta. It is worsened by violations of traffic laws, like illegal parking, loading and unloading, beating the red light, and wrong-way driving. Traffic congestion in Metro Manila is caused by the large number of registered vehicles, lack of roads, and overpopulation, especially in the cities of Manila and Caloocan, as well as the municipality of Pateros.\nTraffic caused losses of \u20b1137,500,000,000 on the economy in 2011, and unbuilt roads and railway projects also causes worsening congestion. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) feared that daily economic losses will reach Php 6,000,000,000 by 2030 if traffic congestion cannot be controlled.\n\nTurkey\nIn recent years, the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality has made huge investments on intelligent transportation systems and public transportation. Despite that, traffic is a significant problem in Istanbul.\nIstanbul has chosen the second most congested and the most sudden-stopping traffic in the world. Travel times in Turkey's largest city take on average 55 percent longer than they should, even in relatively less busy hours.\n\nUnited Kingdom\nIn the United Kingdom the inevitability of congestion in some urban road networks has been officially recognized since the Department for Transport set down policies based on the report Traffic in Towns in 1963:\n\nEven when everything that it is possibly to do by way of building new roads and expanding public transport has been done, there would still be, in the absence of deliberate limitation, more cars trying to move into, or within our cities than could possibly be accommodated.\n\nThe Department for Transport sees growing congestion as one of the most serious transport problems facing the UK. On December 1, 2006, Rod Eddington published a UK government-sponsored report into the future of Britain's transport infrastructure.  The Eddington Transport Study set out the case for action to improve road and rail networks, as a \"crucial enabler of sustained productivity and competitiveness\".  Eddington has estimated that congestion may cost the economy of England \u00a322 bn a year in lost time by 2025. He warned that roads were in serious danger of becoming so congested that the economy would suffer. At the launch of the report Eddington told journalists and transport industry representatives introducing road pricing to encourage drivers to drive less was an \"economic no-brainer\".  There was, he said \"no attractive alternative\".  It would allegedly cut congestion by half by 2025, and bring benefits to the British economy totaling \u00a328 bn a year.\nA congestion charge for driving in central London was introduced in 2003. In 2013, ten years later, Transport for London reported that the scheme resulted in a 10% reduction in traffic volumes from baseline conditions, and an overall reduction of 11% in vehicle kilometers in London. Despite these gains, traffic speeds in central London became progressively slower.\n\nUnited States\nThe Texas Transportation Institute estimated that, in 2000, the 75 largest metropolitan areas experienced 3.6 billion vehicle-hours of delay, resulting in 5.7 billion U.S. gallons (21.6 billion liters) in wasted fuel and $67.5 billion in lost productivity, or about 0.7% of the nation's GDP. It also estimated that the annual cost of congestion for each driver was approximately $1,000 in very large cities and $200 in small cities. Traffic congestion is increasing in major cities and delays are becoming more frequent in smaller cities and rural areas.\n30% of traffic is cars looking for parking.\nAccording to traffic analysis firm INRIX in 2019, the top 31 worst US traffic congested cities (measured in average hours wasted per vehicle for the year) were:\n\nThe most congested highway in the United States, according to a 2010 study of freight congestion (truck speed and travel time), is Chicago's Interstate 290 at the Circle Interchange. The average truck speed was just 29 mph (47 km\/h).\n\nSee also\nConnected car\nIBUS (device)\nJournal of Transport and Land Use\nPeak car\nSmeed's law\nTransims\nTransportation forecasting\nTourist rental cars\nTraffic Message Channel (TMC)\nDonald Shoup\nTraffic obstruction\nUrban planning\n\nReferences\nBianchi Alves, B., & Darido, G.

The complex merged neighboring studios United Recording Corp. on 6050 Sunset Boulevard and Western Studio on 6000 Sunset Boulevard.\nIn 1984, United Western Recorders was renamed and succeeded by Ocean Way Recording. Starting in 1999, the complex was divided into two establishments: Ocean Way Recording (now United Recording Studios) at 6050 Sunset and Cello Studios (now EastWest Studios) at 6000 Sunset.\nSome of the biggest hits of the 1960s were recorded at United Western. According to the book Temples of Sound, \"No other studio has won more technical excellence awards, and no studio has garnered as many Best Engineered Grammys\". Western's Studio 3 is considered iconic for its use by Brian Wilson for the Beach Boys' albums Pet Sounds (1966) and Smile (unreleased).\n\nStructure\nThe complex's two buildings, United Recording and Western Studio, operated more or less independently despite being located only one block apart. United consisted of two large rooms; the larger United 'A' was approximately 45 \u00d7 65 \u00d7 22 feet, with United 'B' being slightly smaller. Western copied the layout of United, with the very large Western 1 and the somewhat smaller Western 2. Both buildings also had a third, smaller recording room, as well as several dubbing and mastering suites. The small rooms provided a sumptuous sound, with Western Studio 3, measuring just 34' \u00d7 15', being Brian Wilson's preference.\n\nHistory\nActive years (1961\u201384)\nPrior to his move to California, Bill Putnam had founded the Universal Recording Corporation studio in Chicago. A pioneer of modern recording technique, Putnam became known for his UREI recording equipment and custom-made Universal Audio mixing consoles, which were bought by major recording studios. After relocating to Hollywood in 1957, and with the backing of Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra, Putnam first established the United Recording Corp. studio complex at 6050 Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood.  By 1958, Studio B was completed, including two reverb chambers. The facility grew to three recording studios, three mastering rooms, a mixdown room and a small-scale record manufacturing plant. The new studios were booked around the clock, busy with TV and movie voiceovers and soundtrack recordings as well as with popular artist's recordings. Hanna-Barbera used the studios to record voices for The Flintstones; Ricky Nelson recorded Poor Little Fool, the first-ever Billboard Hot 100 #1 song in 1958 along albums such a Rick Is 21 from 1961 which includes songs like Hello Mary Lou and Travelin' Man.\nIn 1961, Putnam purchased the neighboring Western Studio at 6000 Sunset, remodeling and incorporating the building into the complex. The buildings were then renamed United Western Recorders, and catered to some of the biggest artists of the era, including Frank Sinatra, the Beach Boys, and Elvis Presley.\nPutnam assembled a talented staff, some of whom became major names in their own right, such as Bones Howe, John Haeny, Lee Hershberg, Chuck Britz, and Wally Heider, one of the pioneers of mobile recording and later of Wally Heider Studios. United was initially favored by older artists such as Crosby, Sinatra, Nat King Cole, and Ray Charles, as well as the young Fleetwoods, while Western soon became a favored recording venue for the new generation of pop-rock musicians and producers, such as Sam Cooke, the Beach Boys, Phil Spector and the Mamas & the Papas.\nIn the early sixties, Putnam scored a significant coup when major US record labels began to release stereophonic recordings in large numbers. According to Allen Sides, when stereo first appeared in the late 1950s, the cost-conscious major labels were initially uninterested, feeling that the market for the new format was limited, and that stereo mixdowns were a waste of time and money. Putnam however foresaw the coming importance of stereo and, at his own expense, he began making simultaneous mono and stereo mixdowns, storing away the stereo versions of these recordings, which at the time were released only in mono. When stereo took off in the early sixties, Putnam had amassed a stockpile of more than two-and-a-half years' worth of stereo recordings by scores of major acts. The value of this stockpile can be estimated from Sides' statement that United Western was at this time bringing in around US$200,000 per month in studio billings\u2014equivalent to perhaps US$1 million per month today. The major labels approached Putnam hoping to buy the stereo tape stockpile, but he struck a far more lucrative deal, in which the labels repaid him for the (far more expensive) studio time he had used in making the stereo mixes.\nIn 1970, Jack Herschorn purchased the Universal Audio mixing console and other pro audio equipment from that studio, including Universal Audio LA-76A and LA-76B limiting amplifiers, Universal Audio vacuum tube power amplifiers (which were actually Dynakit Stereo 70 and 50-watt mono amplifier kits assembled into rack-mount chassis), Fairchild Conax sibilance controllers, Langevin graphic equalizers and Cinema Engineering filters, all originally installed in United Studio A in 1957. Herschorn had this equipment installed under the supervision of Charlie Richmond at Herschorn's Aragon Studios in Vancouver, Canada. The studio would later become Mushroom Studios.\nIn 1982, Eddie Van Halen purchased the UA console from Western Studio 2 and installed it in his personal 5150 Studio. The Van Halen albums 1984, 5150, and OU812 were recorded using the console.\n\nManagement changes\nOcean Way Recording\nIn 1984, Putnam sold the studio complex to Allen Sides, who renamed the buildings Ocean Way Recording, as they would both be known until 1999.\n\nCello Studios\nIn 1999, Sides sold the Western half of the complex to computer magnate Rick Adams, who renamed it Cello Studios. Cello Studios operated at the 6000 Sunset complex from 1999 to 2005.  During that period, the studios hosted high-profile rock artists such as Blink-182, Rage Against the Machine, Tool, System of a Down, Weezer, Muse, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Audioslave, and the Mars Volta. Cello Studios closed in 2005.\nWhen Allen Sides sold Western to Rick Adams, the equipment inventory was also purchased from Ocean Way Recording, including a collection of rare vintage microphones, as well as vintage outboard gear including valuable studio effects units such as the Fairchild 670 limiters, no longer made, which were a crucial element of the sound of many classic pop recordings of the Fifties and Sixties. While the building was modified to accommodate the new facility's needs, the studios themselves have not been altered since Putnam's original design. During this period, the studio played host to artists such as Alanis Morissette, Natalie Merchant, Elton John, R.E.M., Bette Midler, Barenaked Ladies, Stone Temple Pilots, Matthew Sweet, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, Green Day, Vonray and Blink-182.\n\nEastWest Studios\nAt the beginning of 2006, Cello Studios (originally Western) was purchased by EastWest producer Doug Rogers and renamed EastWest Studios. Rogers extensively remodeled the non-technical areas of the studio complex with designer Philippe Starck, but the studios themselves, with their untouched acoustics, remain as originally built by Putnam in the 1960s and continue to operate to this day. Since 2012 EastWest Studios has racked up 130 Grammy nominations, more than any other recording studio in the world.\n\nUnited Recording Studios\nIn 2013, Ocean Way Recording was sold to Hudson Pacific Properties, and in 2015 it was renamed back to United Recording Studios.\n\nTimeline\nLegacy\nFrank Sinatra made his Reprise recordings\u2014including hits like \"It Was a Very Good Year\", \"That's Life\"\u2014in United A, and \"Strangers in the Night\"\u2014in Western 1, and his Reprise records offices were located upstairs. Ray Charles cut his country-soul crossover hit \"I Can't Stop Loving You\" and the LP Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music at United B. As well as the classic Pet Sounds, Western 3 was the venue for the recording of many other chart-topping pop hits, including the Mamas & the Papas' \"California Dreamin'\" and \"Monday, Monday\", the Grass Roots' \"Let's Live for Today\" and \"Midnight Confessions\" and \"Hair\" by the Cowsills. As well as those mentioned above, other artists who have recorded there include Blondie, Elvis Presley, Bobby Vee, the 5th Dimension, the Righteous Brothers, Barbra Streisand, Petula Clark, Ella Fitzgerald, Whitney Houston, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., the Rolling Stones, Elton John, Tom Petty, R.E.M., k.d. lang, Madonna, Rod Stewart, Glen Campbell, Eric Clapton, Bonnie Raitt and Walter Wanderley.\nMany film and television theme songs have been recorded in the studios at 6000 Sunset. The theme songs for Hawaii Five-O, The Partridge Family, The Beverly Hillbillies, and Green Acres were all recorded at Western Recorders.\n\nSee also\nUniversal Recording Corporation\nOcean Way Recording\nEastWest Studios\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nThe United Affiliates Newsletters","223":"The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) is a public land-grant research university in Los Angeles, California, United States. Its academic roots were established in 1881 as a normal school then known as the southern branch of the California State Normal School which later evolved into San Jos\u00e9 State University. The branch was transferred to the University of California to become the Southern Branch of the University of California in 1919, making it the second-oldest of the ten-campus University of California system after the University of California, Berkeley.\nUCLA offers 337 undergraduate and graduate degree programs in a range of disciplines, enrolling about 31,600 undergraduate and 14,300 graduate and professional students annually. It received 174,914 undergraduate applications for Fall 2022, including transfers, making it the most applied-to university in the United States. The university is organized into the College of Letters and Science and twelve professional schools. Six of the schools offer undergraduate degree programs: Arts and Architecture, Engineering and Applied Science, Music, Nursing, Public Affairs, and Theater, Film and Television. Three others are graduate-level professional health science schools: Medicine, Dentistry, and Public Health. Its three remaining schools are Education & Information Studies, Management and Law.\nUCLA student-athletes compete as the Bruins in the Big Ten Conference. They won 123 NCAA team championships while in the Pac-12 Conference, second only to Stanford University's 128 team titles. 410 Bruins have made Olympic teams, winning 270 Olympic medals: 136 gold, 71 silver and 63 bronze. UCLA has been represented in every Olympics since the university's founding (except in 1924) and has had a gold medalist in every Olympics in which the U.S. has participated since 1932.\nAs of March 2024, 16 Nobel laureates, 11 Rhodes scholars, two Turing Award winners, two Chief Scientists of the U.S. Air Force, one Pritzker prize winner, 7 Pulitzer prize winners, two U.S. Poet laureates, one Gauss prize winner, and one Fields Medalist have been affiliated with it as faculty, researchers and alumni. As of March 2024, 59 associated faculty members have been elected to the National Academy of Sciences, 17 to the American Philosophical Society, 32 to the National Academy of Engineering, 42 to the National Academy of Medicine, 10 to the National Academy of Inventors, and 167 to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nHistory\nIn March 1881, at the request of state senator Reginaldo Francisco del Valle, the California State Legislature authorized the creation of a southern branch of the California State Normal School (now San Jos\u00e9 State University) in downtown Los Angeles to train teachers for the growing population of Southern California. The Los Angeles branch of the California State Normal School opened on August 29, 1882, on what is now the site of the Central Library of the Los Angeles Public Library system. The facility included a demonstration school where teachers-in-training could practice their techniques with children. That elementary school would become the present day UCLA Lab School. In 1887, the branch campus became independent and changed its name to Los Angeles State Normal School.\nIn 1914, the school moved to a new campus on Vermont Avenue (now the site of Los Angeles City College) in East Hollywood. In 1917, UC Regent Edward Augustus Dickson, the only regent representing the Southland at the time, and Ernest Carroll Moore, Director of the Normal School, began to lobby the State Legislature to enable the school to become the second University of California campus, after UC Berkeley. They met resistance from UC Berkeley alumni, Northern California members of the state legislature and then-UC President Benjamin Ide Wheeler, who were all vigorously opposed to the idea of a southern campus. However, David Prescott Barrows, the new President of the University of California in 1919, did not share Wheeler's objections.\n\nOn May 23, 1919, the Southern Californians' efforts were rewarded when Governor William D. Stephens signed Assembly Bill 626 into law, which acquired the land and buildings and transformed the Los Angeles Normal School into the Southern Branch of the University of California. The same legislation added its general undergraduate program, the Junior College. The Southern Branch campus opened on September 15 of that year, offering two-year undergraduate programs to 250 Junior College students and 1,250 students in the Teachers College. While University of Southern California students criticized the \"branch\" as a mere \"twig\", Southern Californians continued to fight Northern Californians for the right to three and then four years of instruction. In December 1923, the Board of Regents authorized a fourth year of instruction and transformed the Junior College into the College of Letters and Science, which awarded its first bachelor's degrees in June 1925.\nUnder UC President William Wallace Campbell, enrollment at the Southern Branch expanded so rapidly that by the mid-1920s the institution was outgrowing the 25 acre Vermont Avenue location. The Regents announced the new \"Beverly Site\" \u2014 just west of Beverly Hills \u2014 in 1925. After the athletic teams entered the Pacific Coast conference in 1926, the Southern Branch student council adopted the nickname \"Bruins\", a name offered by the student council at UC Berkeley. On February 1, 1927, the Regents renamed the Southern Branch the University of California at Los Angeles. In the same year, the state broke ground in Westwood on land sold for $1 million, less than one-third its value, by real estate developers Edwin and Harold Janss, for whom the Janss Steps are named. The campus in Westwood opened to students in 1929.\nThe original four buildings were the College Library (now Powell Library), Royce Hall, the Physics-Biology Building (which became the Humanities Building and is now the Renee and David Kaplan Hall), and the Chemistry Building (now Haines Hall), arrayed around a quadrangular courtyard on the 400 acre (1.6 km2) campus. The first undergraduate classes on the new campus were held in 1929 with 5,500 students. UCLA was permitted to award the master's degree in 1933, and the doctorate in 1936, against continued resistance from UC Berkeley.\n\nMaturity as a university\nDuring its first 32 years, UCLA was treated as an off-site department of the main campus in Berkeley. As such, its presiding officer was called a \"provost.\" In 1951, UCLA was formally elevated to coequal status with UC Berkeley, and its presiding officer Raymond B. Allen was the first chief executive to be granted the title of chancellor. In November 1958, the \"at\" in UCLA's name was replaced with a comma, a symbol of its independence from Berkeley.\nThe appointment of Franklin David Murphy to the position of chancellor in 1960 helped spark an era of tremendous growth of facilities and faculty honors. This era secured UCLA's position as a proper university in its own right and not simply a branch of the UC system.\n\nRecent history\nOn June 1, 2016, two men were killed in a murder-suicide at an engineering building in the university. School officials put the campus on lockdown as Los Angeles Police Department officers, including SWAT, cleared the campus. In February 2022, Matthew Harris, a former lecturer and postdoctoral fellow at UCLA, was arrested after allegedly making numerous threats of violence against students and faculty members of UCLA's Philosophy Department.\nIn 2018, a student-led community coalition known as \"Westwood Forward\" successfully led an effort to break UCLA and Westwood Village away from the existing Westwood Neighborhood Council and form a new North Westwood Neighborhood Council, with over 2,000 out of 3,521 stakeholders voting in favor of the split. Westwood Forward's campaign focused on making housing more affordable and encouraging nightlife in Westwood by opposing many of the restrictions on housing developments and restaurants the Westwood Neighborhood Council had promoted. In 2022, UCLA signed an agreement to partner with the Tongva for the caretaking and landscaping of various areas of the campus. This included land use for ceremonial events and educational workshops and outreach events.\nOn April 25, 2024, an occupation protest began at UCLA to protest the administration's investments in Israel amid the Israel\u2013Hamas war. On April 28, clashes occurred between pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel protesters as Stand With Us rallied on the campus, in a protest organised by the Israeli American Council. On May 1, violent clashes were reported on the UCLA campus between pro-Palestinian protesters and groups of counter-demonstrators supporting Israel.\nAs part of the pro-Palestinian protests, students set up encampments on UCLA grounds. The university provided the encampment with private security and metal barricades \u201cto prevent violent confrontations between... protesters.\u201d Ultimately, however, the anti-Israel protestors did not allow students who refused to denounce Israel onto UCLA campus grounds, which was viewed as a \u201cJew Exclusion Zone\u201d by many students on campus. UCLA did not prevent the misuse of their resources that were used to deny Jewish students access to Royce Quad, a central part of UCLA's campus.\nIn June 2024, three Jewish students filed a lawsuit against UCLA, alleging \u201cthat the university played a role in preventing them from accessing the campus freely during protests, when they were blocked from entering the pro-Palestinian encampment erected by protesters.\u201d The students were represented by Becket Law. In July 2024, a federal judge ordered that UCLA must \u201ccreate a plan to ensure Jewish students have equal access to campus\u201d as a result of the lawsuit.\n\nCampus\nThe new UCLA campus in 1929 had four buildings: Royce Hall and Haines Hall on the north, and Powell Library and Kinsey Hall (now called Renee And David Kaplan Hall) on the south. The Janss Steps were the original 87-step entrance to the university that lead to the quad of these four buildings. Today, the campus includes 163 buildings across 419 acres (1.7 km2) in the western part of Los Angeles, north of the Westwood shopping district and just south of Sunset Boulevard. In terms of acreage, it is the second-smallest of the ten UC campuses. The Channel Islands are visible from the UCLA campus.\n\nArchitecture\nThe first buildings were designed by the local firm Allison & Allison. The Romanesque Revival style of these first four structures remained the predominant building style until the 1950s, when architect Welton Becket was hired to supervise the expansion of the campus over the next two decades. Romanesque Revival was chosen as an alternative to Collegiate Gothic to parallel the climate of Southern California to the warm, sunny weather of the Southern Mediterranean.\nBecket greatly streamlined its general appearance, adding several rows of minimalist, slab\u2013shaped brick buildings to the southern half, the largest of these being the UCLA Medical Center. Architects such as A. Quincy Jones, William Pereira, and Paul Williams designed many subsequent structures on the campus during the mid-20th century. More recent additions include buildings designed by architects I.M. Pei, Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates, Richard Meier, Cesar Pelli, and Rafael Vinoly. To accommodate UCLA's rapidly growing student population, multiple construction and renovation projects are in progress, including expansions of the life sciences and engineering research complexes. This continuous construction gives UCLA the nickname \"Under Construction Like Always\".\nOne notable building on campus is named after African-American alumnus Ralph Bunche, who received the 1950 Nobel Peace Prize for negotiating an armistice agreement between the Jews and Arabs in Israel. The entrance of Bunche Hall features a bust of him overlooking the Franklin D. Murphy Sculpture Garden. He was the first individual of non-European background and the first UCLA alumnus to be honored with the Prize.\nThe Hannah Carter Japanese Garden is located a mile north of campus, in the community of Bel Air. The garden was designed by landscape architect Nagao Sakurai of Tokyo and garden designer Kazuo Nakamura of Kyoto in 1959. The garden was donated to UCLA by former UC regent and UCLA alumnus Edward W. Carter and his wife Hannah Carter in 1964 with the stipulation that it remains open to the public. After the garden was damaged by heavy rains in 1968, UCLA Professor of Art and Campus Architect Koichi Kawana took on the task of its reconstruction. The property was sold in 2016 and public access is no longer required.\n\nFilming\nUCLA has attracted filmmakers for decades with its proximity to Hollywood. It was used to represent fictional Windsor College in Scream 2 (1997). In response to frequent requests for filming at the campus, UCLA has instated a policy to regulate filming and professional photography.\n\"UCLA is located in Los Angeles, the same place as the American motion picture industry\", said UCLA visiting professor of film and television Jonathan Kuntz. \"So we're convenient for (almost) all of the movie companies, TV production companies, commercial companies and so on. We're right where the action is.\"\n\nAcademics\nCollege and schools\nCollege and schools of the university - with the year of their founding - include:\n\nHealthcare\nThe David Geffen School of Medicine, School of Nursing, School of Dentistry and Fielding School of Public Health constitute the professional schools of health science. The UCLA Health System operates the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, a hospital in Santa Monica and twelve primary care clinics throughout Los Angeles County. In addition, the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine uses two Los Angeles County public hospitals as teaching hospitals\u2014Harbor\u2013UCLA Medical Center and Olive View\u2013UCLA Medical Center\u2014as well as the largest private nonprofit hospital on the west coast, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. The Greater Los Angeles VA Medical Center is also a major teaching and training site for the university.\nThe UCLA Medical Center made history in 1981 when Assistant Professor Michael Gottlieb first diagnosed AIDS. UCLA medical researchers also pioneered the use of positron emission tomography (PET) scanning to study brain function. Professor of Pharmacology Louis Ignarro was one of the recipients of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discovering the signaling cascade of nitric oxide, one of the most important molecules in cardiopulmonary physiology. The U.S. News & World Report Best Hospitals ranking for 2021 ranks UCLA Medical Center 3rd in the United States and 1st in the West. UCLA Medical Center was ranked within the top 20 in the United States for 15 out of 16 medical specialty areas examined.\n\nResearch\nUCLA is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities \u2013 Very high research activity\" and had $1.32 billion in research expenditures in 2018.\n\nRankings\nNational\nThe 2024 U.S. News & World Report Best Colleges report ranked UCLA first among public universities and tied for 15th among national universities.

In 2015, research firm PitchBook ranked UCLA 9th in the world for venture capital raised by undergraduate alumni, and 11th in the world for producing the most MBA graduate alumni who are entrepreneurs backed by venture capital.\n\nLibrary system\nUCLA's library system has over nine million books and 70,000 serials in over twelve libraries and eleven other archives, reading rooms, and research centers. It is the United States' 12th largest library in number of volumes. The first library, University Library (presently Powell Library), was founded in 1884. Lawrence Powell became librarian in 1944, and began a series of system overhauls and modifications, and in 1959, was named Dean of the School of Library Service. More libraries were added as previous ones filled.\n\nMedical school admissions\nAccording to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), UCLA supplies the most undergraduate applicants to U.S. medical schools among all American universities. In 2015, UCLA supplied 961 medical school applicants, followed by UC Berkeley with 819 and the University of Florida with 802. Among first-time medical school applicants who received their bachelor's degree from UCLA in 2014, 51% were admitted to at least one U.S. medical school.\n\nAdmissions\nUndergraduate\nU.S. News & World Report rates UCLA \"Most Selective\" and The Princeton Review rates its admissions selectivity of 98 out of 99. 149,815 prospective freshmen applied for Fall 2021, the most of any four-year university in the United States.\nAdmission rates vary according to the residency of applicants. For Fall 2019, California residents had an admission rate of 12.0%, while out-of-state U.S. residents had an admission rate of 16.4% and internationals had an admission rate of 8.4%. UCLA's overall freshman admit rate for the Fall 2019 term was 12.3%.\nAs of 2020, the basis for selection at UCLA includes several academic and nonacademic factors. Those considered \"very important\" are all academic; they are rigor of secondary school record, academic GPA, standardized test scores, and application essay(s). Those considered \"important\" are talent\/ability, character\/personal qualities, volunteer work, work experience, and extracurricular activities. Factors that are not considered at all include class rank, interviews, alumni relation, and racial\/ethnic status. UCLA is need-blind for domestic applicants.\nEnrolled freshman for Fall 2019 had an unweighted GPA of 3.90, an SAT interquartile range of 1280\u20131510, and an ACT interquartile range of 27\u201334. The SAT interquartile ranges were 640\u2013740 for reading\/writing and 640\u2013790 for math. Among the admitted freshman applicants for the Fall 2019 term, 43.1% chose to enroll at UCLA.\nUCLA's freshman admission rate varies drastically across colleges. For Fall 2016, the College of Letters and Science had an admission rate of 21.2%, the Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science (HSSEAS) had an admission rate of 12.4%, the Herb Alpert School of Music had an admission rate of 23.5%, the School of the Arts and Architecture had an admission rate of 10.3%, the School of Nursing had an admission rate of 2.2%, and the School of Theater, Film and Television had an admission rate of 4.4%.\nOne of the major issues is the decreased admission of African-Americans since the passage of Proposition 209 in 1996, prohibiting state governmental institutions from considering race, sex, or ethnicity, specifically in the areas of public employment, public contracting, and public education. UCLA responded by shifting to a holistic admissions process in Fall 2007, which evaluates applicants based on their opportunities in high school, personal hardships, and unusual circumstances at home.\n\nGraduate\nFor Fall 2020, the David Geffen School of Medicine admitted 2.9% of its applicants, making it the 8th most selective U.S. medical school. The School of Law had a median undergraduate GPA of 3.82 and median Law School Admission Test (LSAT) score of 170 for the enrolled class of 2024. The Anderson School of Management had a middle-80% GPA range of 3.1\u20133.8 and an average Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) score of 711 for the enrolled MBA class of 2024.\nThe School of Dentistry had an average overall GPA of 3.65, an average science GPA of 3.6 and an average Dental Admissions Test (DAT) score of 22.8 for the enrolled class of 2025. The Graduate School of Nursing has an acceptance rate of 33% as of 2022. For Fall 2020, the Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science (HSSEAS) had a graduate acceptance rate of 27%.\n\nEconomic impact\nThe university has a significant impact in the Los Angeles economy. It is the fifth largest employer in the county (after Los Angeles County, the Los Angeles Unified School District, the federal government and the City of Los Angeles) and the seventh largest in the region.\n\nTrademarks and licensing\nThe UCLA trademark \"is the exclusive property of the Regents of the University of California\", but it is managed, protected, and licensed through UCLA Trademarks and Licensing, a division of the Associated Students UCLA, the largest student employer on campus. As such, the ASUCLA also has a share in trademark profits.\nApparel, fashion accessories and other items with UCLA'S logo and insignea are popular in many parts of the world due to both the university's academic and athletic prestige, and its association with colorful images of Southern California life and culture. This demand for UCLA-branded merchandise has inspired the licensing of its trademark to UCLA brand stores throughout Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Since 1980, 15 UCLA stores have opened in South Korea, and 49 are currently open in China. The newest store recently opened in Kuwait; there are also stores in Mexico, Singapore and India. UCLA earns about $400,000 in royalties each year through its international licensing program.\n\nCommerce on campus\nUCLA has various store locations around campus, with the main store in Ackerman Union. In addition, UCLA-themed products are sold at the gift shop of Fowler Museum on campus. Due to licensing and trademarks, products with UCLA logos and insignia are usually higher priced than their unlicensed counterparts. These products are popular among visitors, who buy them as gifts and souvenirs. The UCLA store offers some products, such as notebooks and folders, in both licensed (logoed) and cheaper unlicensed (un-logoed) options, but for other products the latter option is often unavailable. Students employed part-time by ASUCLA at UCLA Stores and Restaurants receive discounts when they shop at UCLA Stores.\n\nAthletics\nThe school's sports teams are called the Bruins, represented by the colors true blue and gold. The Bruins participate in NCAA Division I as part of the Big Ten Conference. Two notable sports facilities serve as home venues for UCLA sports. The Bruin men's football team plays home games at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena; the team won a national title in 1954. The basketball and volleyball teams, and the women's gymnastics team compete at Pauley Pavilion on campus. The school also sponsors cross country, soccer, women's rowing, golf, tennis, water polo, track and field, and women's softball.\nThe mascots are Joe and Josephine Bruin, and the fight songs are Sons of Westwood and Mighty Bruins. The alma mater is Hail to the Hills of Westwood. When Henry \"Red\" Sanders came to UCLA to coach football in 1949, the uniforms were redesigned. Sanders added a gold loop on the shoulders\u2014the UCLA Stripe. The navy blue was changed to a lighter shade of blue. Sanders figured that the baby blue would look better on the field and in film. He dubbed the uniform \"Powder Keg Blue\", a powder blue with an explosive kick. This would also differentiate UCLA from all other UC teams, whose official colors are blue and gold.\nUCLA competes in all major Division I sports and has won 135 national championships, including 123 NCAA championships. Only Stanford University has more NCAA team championships, with 135. On April 21, 2018, UCLA's women's gymnastics team defeated Oklahoma Sooners to win its 7th NCAA National Championship as well as UCLA's 115th overall team title. Most recently, UCLA's women's soccer team defeated Florida State to win its first NCAA National Championship along with women's tennis who defeated North Carolina to win its second NCAA National title ever. UCLA's softball program is also outstanding. Women's softball won their NCAA-leading 12th National Championship, on June 4, 2019. The women's water polo team is also dominant, with a record 7 NCAA championships. Notably, the team helped UCLA become the first school to win 100 NCAA championships overall when they won their fifth on May 13, 2007.\nThe men's water polo team won UCLA's 112th, 113th, and 114th national championships, defeating USC in the championship game three times: on December 7, 2014, on December 6, 2015, and on December 3, 2017. On October 9, 2016, the top-ranked men's water polo team broke the NCAA record for consecutive wins when they defeated UC Davis for their 52nd straight win. This toppled Stanford's previous record of 51 consecutive wins set in 1985\u201387. The men's water polo team has become a dominant sport on campus with a total of 11 national championships.\nAmong UCLA's 123 championship titles, some of the more notable victories are in men's basketball. Under legendary coach John Wooden, UCLA men's basketball teams won 10 NCAA championships, including a record seven consecutive, in 1964, 1965, 1967\u20131973, and 1975, and an 11th was added under then-coach Jim Harrick in 1995 (through 2008, the most consecutive by any other team is two). From 1971 to 1974, UCLA men's basketball won an unprecedented 88 consecutive games.\nUCLA has also shown dominance in men's volleyball, with 21 national championships. The first 19 teams were led by former coach Al Scates.  UCLA is one of only six universities (Michigan, Stanford, Ohio State, California, and Florida being the others) to have won national championships in all three major men's sports (baseball, basketball, and football).\n\nUSC rivalry\nUCLA shares a traditional sports rivalry with the University of Southern California. UCLA teams have won the second-most NCAA Division I-sanctioned team championships, while USC has the third-most. Only Stanford University, a fellow Pac-12 member also located in California, has more than either UCLA or USC. The football rivalry is distinctive for two of the strongest conference programs located in one city. In football, UCLA has one national champion team and 16 conference titles, compared to USC's 11 national championships and 37 conference championships. The two football teams compete for annual possession of the Victory Bell, the trophy of the rivalry football game.\nThe schools share a rivalry in many other sports, and are each the best in the nation for many. UCLA has won 19 NCAA Championships in men's volleyball, 11 in men's basketball, 12 in Softball, and 7 in women's water polo, the most of any school in those sports. USC has won 26 NCAA Championships in Men's Outdoor Track and Field, 21 in men's tennis, and 12 in baseball, also the most of any school in each respective sport. The annual SoCal BMW Crosstown Cup compares the two schools based on their performance in 19 varsity sports; UCLA has won five times and USC has won nine times. This rivalry extends to the Olympic Games, where UCLA athletes have won 250 medals over a span of 50 years while USC athletes have won 287 over 100 years. UCLA and USC also compete in the We Run The City 5K, an annual charity race to raise donations for Special Olympics Southern California. The race is located on the campus of one of the schools and switches to the other campus each year. USC won the race in 2013 and 2015, while UCLA won the race in 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2017.\n\nStudent life\nThe campus is located near prominent entertainment venues such as the Getty Center, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) and the Santa Monica Pier. UCLA offers classical orchestras, intramural sports, and over 1000 student organizations  UCLA is also home to 66 fraternities and sororities, which represent 13% of the undergraduate population. Phrateres, a non-exclusive social-service club for women was founded here in 1924 by the Dean of Women, Helen Matthewson Laughlin. Students and staff participate in dinghy sailing, surfing, windsurfing, rowing, and kayaking at the UCLA Marina Aquatic Center in Marina del Rey.\nUCLA is home to a slew of performing arts groups, including an improv comedy team called Rapid Fire. UCLA's first contemporary a cappella group, Awaken A Cappella, was founded in 1992. The all-male group, Bruin Harmony, has enjoyed a successful career since its inception in 2006, portraying a collegiate a cappella group in The Social Network (2010), while the ScatterTones finished in second-place in the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA) in 2012, 2013, and 2014, and third-place in 2017, 2019, and 2022. In 2020, The A Cappella Archive ranked the ScatterTones at #2 among all ICCA-competing groups. Resonance, founded in 2012, was an ICCA finalist in 2021. Other a cappella groups include Signature, Random Voices, Medleys, YOUTHphonics, Deviant Voices, AweChords, Pitch Please, Da Verse, Naya Zaamana, Jewkbox, On That Note, Tinig Choral, and Cadenza. YOUTHphonics and Medleys are UCLA's only nonprofit service-oriented a cappella groups.\nThere are a variety of cultural organizations on campus, such as Nikkei Student Union (NSU), Japanese Student Association (JSA), Association of Chinese Americans (ACA), Chinese Students and Scholars Association (CSSA), Chinese Music Ensemble (CME), Chinese Cultural Dance Club (CCDC), Taiwanese American Union (TAU), Taiwanese Student Association (TSA), Hong Kong Student Society (HKSS), Hanoolim Korean Cultural Awareness Group, Samahang Pilipino, Vietnamese Student Union (VSU), and Thai Smakom. Many of these organizations have an annual \"culture night\" consisting of drama and dance which raises awareness of culture and history to the campus and community.\nAdditionally, there are over twenty LGBTQ organizations on campus, including the undergraduate student organizations Queer Alliance, BlaQue, Lavender Health Alliance, OutWrite Newsmagazine, Queer and Trans in STEM (qtSTEM), and Transgender UCLA Pride (TransUP) as well as the graduate student organizations Out@Anderson, OUTLaw, and Luskin PRIDE. Notably, OutWrite, established under the name TenPercent in 1979, is the first college queer newsmagazine in the country. The UCLA Center for LGBTQ+ Advocacy, Research & Health was founded in 2020. UCLA operates on a quarter calendar with the exception of the UCLA School of Law and the UCLA School of Medicine, which operate on a semester calendar.\n\nTraditions\nUCLA's official charity is UniCamp, founded in 1934. It is a week-long summer camp for under-served children from the greater Los Angeles area, with UCLA volunteer counselors. UniCamp runs for seven weeks throughout the summer at Camp River Glen in the San Bernardino National Forest. Because UniCamp is a non-profit organization, student volunteers from UCLA also fundraise money throughout the year to allow these children to attend summer camp.\nThe Pediatric AIDS Coalition organizes the annual Dance Marathon in Pauley Pavilion, where thousands of students raise a minimum of $250 and dance for 26 hours to support the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, Project Kindle, and the UCLA AIDS Institute. Dancers are not allowed to sit (except to use the restroom) during the marathon, literally taking a stand against pediatric AIDS, and symbolizing the suffering of affected children around the world. In 2015, Dance Marathon at UCLA raised $446,157.\nDuring Finals Week, UCLA students participate in \"Midnight Yell\", where they yell as loudly as possible for a few minutes at midnight to release some stress from studying. The quarterly Undie Run takes place during the Wednesday evening of Finals Week, when students run through the campus in their underwear or in skimpy costumes. With the increasing safety hazards and Police and Administration involvement, a student committee changed the route to a run through campus to Shapiro Fountain, which culminates with students dancing in the fountain. The Undie Run has spread to other American universities, including the University of Texas at Austin, Arizona State University, and Syracuse University.\n\nThe Alumni Association sponsors several events, usually large extravaganzas involving huge amounts of coordination, such as the 70-year-old Spring Sing, organized by the Student Alumni Association (SAA). UCLA's oldest tradition, Spring Sing is an annual gala of student talent, which is held at either Pauley Pavilion or the outdoor Los Angeles Tennis Center. The committee bestows the George and Ira Gershwin Lifetime Achievement Award each year to a major contributor to the music industry. Past recipients have included Stevie Wonder, Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, James Taylor, Ray Charles, Natalie Cole, Quincy Jones, Lionel Richie, and in 2009, Julie Andrews. The Dinner for 12 Strangers is a gathering of students, alumni, administration and faculty to network around different interests. The \"Beat 'SC Bonfire and Rally\" occurs the week before the USC rivalry football game.\nThe USAC Cultural Affairs Commission hosts the JazzReggae Festival, a two-day concert on Memorial Day weekend that attracts more than 20,000 attendees. The JazzReggae Festival is the largest entirely student produced and run event of its kind on the West Coast.\nSigma Eta Pi and Bruin Entrepreneurs organize LA Hacks, an annual hackathon where students from around the United States come to build technology products. LA Hacks established itself as the largest hackathon in the United States when over 1500 students participated on April 11\u201313, 2014. LA Hacks also holds the record for the most funds raised via corporate sponsorships with $250,000 raised. Some of the tech world's most prominent people have given talks and judged projects at LA Hacks, including Evan Spiegel (Founder and CEO of Snapchat), Alexis Ohanian (co-founder of Reddit), Sam Altman (President of Y Combinator) and Chris De Wolfe (Founder of Myspace).\n\nStudent government\nThe Associated Students UCLA (ASUCLA) encompasses the student government and student-led enterprises at UCLA. ASUCLA has four major components: the Undergraduate Students Association, the Graduate Students Association, Student Media, and Services & Enterprises. However, in common practice, the term ASUCLA refers to the services and enterprises component. This includes the Student Store, Bookstore, Food Services, Student Union, etc. These commercial enterprises generate approximately $40 million in annual revenues. As a nonprofit corporation, the financial goal of ASUCLA is to provide quality services and programs for students. ASUCLA is governed by a student-majority Board of Directors. The Undergraduate Students Association and Graduate Students Association each appoint three members plus one alternative. In addition to the student members, there are representatives appointed by the administration, the academic senate, and the alumni association. The \"services and enterprises\" portion of ASUCLA is run by a professional executive director who oversees some 300 staff and 2,000 student employees.\nThe Graduate Students Association is the governing body for approximately 13,000 graduate and professional students at UCLA. The Undergraduate Students Association Council (USAC) is the governing body of the Undergraduate Students Association (USA) whose membership comprises every UCLA undergraduate student. As of 2015, the student body had two major political slates: Bruins United and Let's Act. In the Spring 2016 election, the two competing parties were Bruins United and Waves of Change\u2014a smaller faction that broke off of Lets Act.\nUSAC's fifteen student officers and commissioners are elected by members of the Undergraduate Students Association at an annual election held during Spring Quarter. In addition to its fifteen elected members, USAC includes appointed representatives of the Administration, the Alumni, and the Faculty, as well as two ex-officio members, the ASUCLA Executive Director and a student Finance Committee Chairperson who is appointed by the USA President and approved by USAC. All members of USAC may participate fully in Council deliberations, but only the elected officers, minus the USAC President may vote. Along with the council, the student government also includes a seven-member Judicial Board, which similar to the Supreme Court, serves as the judicial branch of government and reviews actions of the council. These seven students are appointed by the student body president and confirmed by the council.\nUSAC's programs offers additional services to the campus and surrounding communities. For example, each year approximately 40,000 students, faculty and staff attend programs of the Campus Events Commission, including a low-cost film program, a speakers program which presents leading figures from a wide range of disciplines, and performances by dozens of entertainers. Two to three thousand UCLA undergraduates participate annually in the more than twenty voluntary outreach programs run by the Community Service Commission. A large corps of undergraduate volunteers also participate in programs run by the Student Welfare Commission, such as AIDS Awareness, Substance Abuse Awareness, Blood Drives and CPR\/First Aid Training. The film program is part of the Bruin Film Society, which is also a registered organization to host advance screenings of films during Oscars season. It hosts other events, like filmmaker panels, through its partnership with production and distribution company A24.\n\nMedia publications\nUCLA Student Media is the home of UCLA's newspaper, magazines, and radio station. Most student media publications are governed by the ASUCLA Communications Board. The Daily Bruin is UCLA's most prominent student publication. Founded in 1919 under the name Cub Californian, it has since then developed into Los Angeles' third-most circulated newspaper. It has won dozens of national awards and is regularly commended for layout and content. In 2016, the paper won two National Pacemaker Awards \u2013 one for the best college newspaper in the country, and another for the best college media website in the country. \n\nUCLA Student Media also publishes seven special-interest news magazines: Al-Talib, Fem, Ha'Am, La Gente, Nommo, Pacific Ties, and OutWrite, a school yearbook, BruinLife, and the student-run radio station, UCLA Radio. Student groups such as The Forum for Energy Economics and Development also publish yearly journals focused on energy technologies and industries. There is also a student-run satire newspaper, The Westwood Enabler. There are also numerous graduate student-run journals at UCLA, such as Carte Italiane, Issues in Applied Linguistics, and Mediascape. Many of these publications are available through open access. The School of Law publishes the UCLA Law Review which is currently ranked seventh among American law schools.\n\nHousing\nUCLA provides housing to over 10,000 undergraduate and 2,900 graduate students. Most undergraduate students are housed in 14 complexes on the western side of campus, referred to by students as \"The Hill\". Students can live in halls, plazas, suites, or university apartments, which vary in pricing and privacy. Housing plans also offer students access to dining facilities, which have been ranked by the Princeton Review as some of the best in the United States. Dining halls are located in Covel Commons, Rieber Hall, Carnesale Commons and De Neve Plaza. In winter 2012, a dining hall called The Feast at Rieber opened to students. The newest dining hall (as of Winter Quarter 2014) is Bruin Plate, located in the Carnesale Commons (commonly referred to as Sproul Plaza). Residential cafes include Bruin Cafe, Rendezvous, The Study at Hedrick, and Cafe 1919. UCLA currently offers four years guaranteed housing to its incoming freshmen, and two years to incoming transfer students. There are four types of housing available for students: residential halls, deluxe residential halls, residential plazas, and residential suites. Available on the hill are study rooms, basketball courts, tennis courts, and Sunset Recreational Center which includes three swimming pools.\nGraduate students are housed in one of five apartment complexes. Weyburn Terrace is located just southwest of the campus in Westwood Village. The other four are roughly five miles south of UCLA in Palms and Mar Vista. They too vary in pricing and privacy. Approximately 400 students live at the University Cooperative Housing Association, located two blocks off campus. Students who are involved in Greek life have the option to also live in Greek housing while at UCLA. Sorority houses are located east of campus on Hilgard Avenue, and fraternity houses are located west of campus throughout Westwood Village. A student usually lives with 50+ students in Greek housing.\n\nHospitality\nHospitality constituents of the university include departments not directly related to student life or administration. The Hospitality department manages the university's two on-campus hotels, the UCLA Guest House and the Meyer and Renee Luskin Conference Center. The 61-room Guest House services those visiting the university for campus-related activities. The department also manages the UCLA Conference Center, a 40-acre (0.2 km2) conference center in the San Bernardino Mountains near Lake Arrowhead. Hospitality also operates UCLA Catering, a vending operation, and a summer conference center located on the Westwood campus.\n\nChabad House\nThe UCLA Chabad House is a community center for Jewish students operated by the Orthodox Jewish Chabad movement. Established in 1969, it was the first Chabad House at a university. In 1980, three students died in a fire in the original building of the UCLA Chabad House. The present building was erected in their memory. The building, completed in 1984, was the first of many Chabad houses worldwide designed as architectural reproductions of the residence of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson at 770 Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn, New York. The Chabad House hosts the UCLA chapter of The Rohr Jewish Learning Institute's Sinai Scholars Society.\n\nHealthy Campus Initiative\nIn January 2013, Chancellor Gene Block launched the UCLA Healthy Campus Initiative (HCI), envisioned and supported by Jane and Terry Semel. The Semel HCI prioritizes the health and wellness of UCLA students, staff, and faculty by \"making the healthy choice the easy choice.\" The goal of the initiative is to make UCLA the healthiest campus in the country, and to share best practices and research with other communities, locally and beyond. The initiative is a campuswide, multi-year effort that champions programs such as the tobacco-free policy, expansion of campus gardens, stairwell makeovers, bicycle infrastructure improvements, healthy and sustainable dining options, and peer counseling, among others.\nThe UCLA Healthy Campus Initiative is credited with providing inspiration for national initiatives including the Partnership for a Healthier America (PHA) Healthier Campus Initiative and the University of California Office of the President (UCOP) Global Food Initiative (GFI). In November 2014, UCLA was one of the 20 inaugural colleges and universities to pledge to adopt PHA's guidelines for food and nutrition, physical activity and programming over three years. The Semel HCI is a member of both the Menus of Change Research Collaborative and the Teaching Kitchen Collaborative, and a contributor to The Huffington Post.\n\nFaculty and alumni\nAward laureates and scholars\nUCLA's faculty and alumni have won a number of awards including:\n\n\tNotable UCLA alumni include:\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nAs of October 2023, 28 Nobel laureates have been affiliated with UCLA: 12 professors, 8 alumni and 10 researchers (three overlaps).

It opened in May 1939 as the Los Angeles Union Passenger Terminal, replacing La Grande Station and Central Station.\nApproved in a controversial ballot measure in 1926 and built in the 1930s, it served to consolidate rail services from the Union Pacific, Santa Fe, and Southern Pacific Railroads into one terminal station. Conceived on a grand scale, Union Station became known as the \"Last of the Great Railway Stations\" built in the United States. The structure combines Art Deco, Mission Revival, and Streamline Moderne style. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.\nToday, the station is a major transportation hub for Southern California, serving almost 110,000 passengers a day. It is by far the busiest train station in the Western United States; it is Amtrak's fifth-busiest station, and is the thirteenth-busiest train station in North America.\nFour of Amtrak's long-distance trains originate and terminate here: the Coast Starlight to Seattle, the Southwest Chief and Texas Eagle to Chicago, and the Sunset Limited to New Orleans. The state-supported Amtrak Pacific Surfliner regional trains run frequently to San Diego and also to Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo. The station is the hub of the Metrolink commuter rail system and is a major transfer point for several Metro Rail light rail and rapid transit lines. The Patsaouras Transit Plaza, on the east side of the station, serves dozens of bus lines operated by Metro and several other municipal carriers.\n\nHistory\nThe city council of Los Angeles had desired since the 1910s to construct a Union station to replace the existing three terminal stations in Los Angeles: the Santa Fe's La Grande Station, the Southern Pacific's Central Station, and the Union Pacific's Salt Lake Station. As the proposed station would be built and owned by the city and open to all prospective railroads, it threatened to break these three railroads' control over rail traffic into and out of the city. Their opposition led to a series of legal cases that were still not resolved by 1925, when the railroads offered a compromise solution. The Union Pacific's Salt Lake Station had burned down in 1924, forcing it to rent space in the Southern Pacific's Central Station. The railroads proposed to make this arrangement permanent, reducing the number of terminals to two, while also constructing a large network of elevated tracks at their own expense, to be used by them and the Pacific Electric. Not only would the new electrified tracks link the two terminals, but they would eliminate street running on some of the busiest streets in Los Angeles.\nThe railroads' proposal immediately generated public controversy for and against the proposal, and in February 1926 the council agreed to place a non-binding question on the ballot asking voters whether they were in favor of the city council's union station proposal or the railroads' elevated railway plan. Proposition 8 asked \"Shall a Union Railway Passenger Terminal for all steam railroads be established in the City of Los Angeles?\", while Proposition 9 asked whether the proposed station should be built in Los Angeles Plaza. The issue became extremely heated, with both sides fiercely arguing their point. Elevated railway proponents, such as the Los Angeles Examiner and the Greater Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, pointed to the safety benefits of the elimination of grade crossings and the benefits to businesses of reduced traffic congestion, as well as claiming that the proposed union station site would cause heavy road congestion. Union station proponents, such as the Los Angeles Times and many homeowner associations, claimed that elevated railways harmed property values, made streets dangerously dark, produced unacceptable levels of noise, and were less safe than other forms of railroad. As the Los Angeles Plaza was near Los Angeles' original Chinatown, the debate took on racial connotations as well, with the Examiner claiming that being near Chinatown would mean that visitors to the city would receive a bad first impression, and the Times countering by arguing that the construction of the station would allow for urban renewal that would \"spell the passing of Chinatown\".\n\nWhen the two propositions were finally put to a vote, both passed; Proposition 8 by a 61.3 to 38.7 percent margin, and Proposition 9 by a much smaller 51.1 to 48.9 percent margin. However, largely due to the efforts of preservationist Christine Sterling and Los Angeles Times publisher Harry Chandler, Union Station would not replace the Plaza, but be built across the street in Chinatown, which was demolished for the project. During the construction process of Union Station, archaeological remains from the Tongva village of Yaanga were uncovered. Researcher Joan Brown summarized this in 1992:Previous archaeological studies conducted at and near Union Station indicate that buried intact prehistoric and historic deposits exist in-situ beneath and in the vicinity of Union Station. The extent of the archaeological deposits is unknown at this time. Union Station was constructed on three to twenty feet of fill dirt placed over the original Los Angeles Chinatown. Chinatown, in turn, had been built over the remains of an Indian village, tentatively identified as the village of Yangna.The glamorous new $11 million station (in 1939 dollars) took over from La Grande Station which had suffered major damage in the 1933 Long Beach earthquake and Central Station, which had itself replaced the Arcade Depot in 1914.\nPassenger service was provided by the Santa Fe, Southern Pacific, and Union Pacific, as well as local lines of the Pacific Electric Railway and Los Angeles Railway (LARy). The famed Super Chief luxury train carried Hollywood stars and others to Chicago and thence the East Coast. Union Station saw heavy use during World War II, but later saw declining patronage due to the growing popularity of air travel and automobiles.\n\nIn 1948, the Santa Fe's Super Chief lost its brakes coming into the station, smashed through a steel bumper and concrete wall, and stopped with one third of the front of the locomotive dangling over Aliso St. No one was killed or injured, but the engineer lost his job.\nThe station was designated as a Los Angeles Historic\u2013Cultural Monument No. 101 on August 2, 1972, and placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.\nThe first commuter rail service to Union Station was the short-lived CalTrain that began operating on October 18, 1982, between Los Angeles and Oxnard. The service faced economic and political problems from the start and was suspended in March 1983. The next attempt at commuter rail came in 1990 with the launch of the Amtrak-operated Orange County Commuter. The once-daily round-trip served stations between Los Angeles and San Juan Capistrano.\nIn December 1989, the Santa Fe Pacific Realty Co purchased Southern Pacific's shareholding in the station, followed in January 1990 by Union Pacific's 22% and Santa Fe's 34%.\nMetrolink commuter rail service began on October 26, 1992, with Union Station as the terminus for the San Bernardino Line, the Santa Clarita Line (later renamed the Antelope Valley Line) and the Ventura County Line. In January 1993, Metro's Red Line subway began service to the station, followed by Metrolink's Riverside Line in June. The Orange County Commuter train was discontinued on March 28, 1994, and replaced by Metrolink's Orange County Line. In May 2002, Metrolink added additional service to stations in Orange and Riverside counties with the opening of the 91 Line (now the 91\/Perris Valley Line.)\nLight rail service arrived at Union Station on July 26, 2003, when Metro's Gold Line began operating to Pasadena from tracks 1 and 2. The line was expanded south over US 101 in November 2009 with the opening of the Gold Line Eastside Extension.\nIn February 2011, the board of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) approved the purchase of Union Station from Prologis and Catellus Development (a descendant of the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific railroads) for $75 million. The deal was closed on April 14, 2011. Since taking over ownership of the station, Metro has focused on increasing services for passengers at the station. One of the most noticeable changes is the addition of several retail and dining businesses to the concourse.\nAmtrak opened a Metropolitan Lounge at Union Station on September 23, 2013. The lounge is open to Amtrak passengers traveling in sleeping car accommodations as well as some Amtrak Guest Rewards members (Select Plus and Select Executive levels only). The lounge features a staffed ticket counter, complimentary refreshments, complimentary Wi-Fi, and a conference room. Passengers using the Metropolitan Lounge receive priority boarding.\nMetro plans to install Bluetooth beacons in Union Station to enable sending text messages to travelers' smartphones.\nOn March 15, 2021, it was announced that the station would serve as a joint venue of the 93rd Academy Awards along with the Dolby Theatre due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cinema. The ceremony was criticized for limiting access to the station and its COVID-19 testing site due to security measures mandated by the Academy.\nOn October 19, 2022, Greyhound moved its primary Los Angeles station to the Patsaouras Transit Plaza at Union Station.\n\nArchitecture\nUnion Station was partially designed by John and Donald Parkinson, the father-and-son architectural firm who had also designed Los Angeles City Hall and other landmark Los Angeles buildings. They were assisted by a group of supporting architects, including Jan van der Linden. The structure combines Art Deco, Mission Revival, and Streamline Moderne style, with architectural details such as eight-pointed stars, and even elements of Dutch Colonial Revival architecture (at the suggestion of the Dutch-born Jan von der Linden).\nEnclosed garden patios are on either side of the waiting room, and passengers exiting the trains were originally directed through the southern garden. The lower parts of the interior walls are covered in travertine marble; the upper parts have an early form of acoustical tile. The floor in the large rooms is terra cotta with a central strip of inlaid marble (including travertine, somewhat unusual in floors since it is soft). The ceiling in the grand waiting room has the appearance of wood, but is actually made of steel.\nThe original ticket lobby has 62-foot (19 m) high ceilings and a 110-foot (34 m) counter. It is closed to the public, but occasionally rented out for film shoots or special events. Public art has been added to the station including an aquarium with a wall featuring etchings of Tongva and Latino settlers such as P\u00edo Pico.\nInside the grand waiting room is the Traxx restaurant and bar, which is Art Deco-themed, reflecting the history and architectural grandeur of its home. The restaurant opened in the late 1990s, and became a \"top draw\" at Union Station, according to the Los Angeles Times. Traxx closed between May and September 2019 as ownership of the restaurant changed.\nAttached to the main building to the south is the station restaurant designed by the famed Southwestern architect Mary Colter. It was the last of the \"Harvey House\" restaurants to be constructed as a part of a passenger terminal. The vast rectangular dining room has a rounded central counter, streamlined booths and inlaid cement tile floor in the pattern of a Navajo blanket.\nColter also designed a sleek, Streamline Moderne cocktail lounge. The restaurant closed in 1967 and for decades remained largely empty, used only for the occasional film shoot or special event. In October 2018, following a four-year renovation process, the dining room re-opened as the \"Imperial Western Beer Co.,\" a restaurant and bar with its own attached brewery, and the cocktail lounge re-opened as \"The Streamliner,\" a smaller craft cocktail bar.\nEven with its grand scale, Union Station is still considered small in comparison to other union stations.\n\nPublic art\nAlthough Union Station contains no distinct sculptures or artworks from its early years, Metro rail development in the 1990s funded the installation of a variety of notable public art murals and sculptural installations for the station's new subterranean lobbies, portals and subway platforms.  The following Union Station public artworks include murals, granite seating sculptures, electronic wall-mounted art, glass mosaics, and a river-themed sculptural installation incorporating found objects from the subway excavation and an aquarium of native sea life.\n\nL.A.: City of Angels (1993) by Cynthia Carlson\nTraveler (1993) by Terry Schoonhoven\nUnion Chairs (1993) by Christopher Sproat\nLa Sombra del Arroyo (1995) by East Los Streetscapers\nCity of Dreams (1996) by Richard Wyatt Jr.\nRiver of History (1996) by May Sun\nRiverbench (1996) by May Sun and Paul Diez\nA-Train (1996) by Bill Bell\nSolar Shift: San Bernardino and Santa Monica (2006) by Roy Nicholson\n\nLocation\nUnion Station is located in the northeastern corner of Downtown Los Angeles, on the property bounded by Alameda Street, Cesar Chavez Avenue, Vignes Street, and the Hollywood Freeway. It is across Alameda Street from L.A.'s historic Olvera Street and El Pueblo de Los Angeles State Historic Park. The historic Terminal Annex building is on the opposite side of the Chavez Avenue underpass. Chinatown and Civic Center are a short distance away.\nThe Patsaouras Transit Plaza on the east side of Union Station hosts several connecting bus lines, including Metro Local, Metro Rapid and Metro Express lines, as well as downtown DASH shuttles, many municipal bus lines, FlyAway express bus service to Los Angeles International Airport, Greyhound buses, and University of Southern California campus shuttles. The Transit Plaza is named after Nick Patsaouras, former RTD board member and advocate for public transportation.\nThe Gateway Transit Center includes the station itself and the Patsaouras Transit Plaza, both of which were designed by Ehrenkrantz & Eckstut, along with the western terminus of the El Monte Busway, as well as Metro's headquarters building.\nAs of October 2019, Amtrak and Metrolink share 12 of Union Station's 14 outdoor tracks, with 94 trains departing on most weekdays (95 on Wednesday, 96 on Friday).\n\nServices\nAmtrak\nAmtrak long-distance routes\nUnion Station is the western terminus for four of Amtrak's long-distance trains:\n\nCoast Starlight, to Seattle (daily, service began 1971)\nSouthwest Chief, to Chicago (daily, service began 1939 as Super Chief, renamed Southwest Limited in 1974 and Southwest Chief in 1984)\nSunset Limited, to New Orleans (tri-weekly, service began 1939)\nTexas Eagle, to Chicago (tri-weekly, service began 1982): Runs combined with the Sunset Limited to San Antonio, where the train is split.\n\nAmtrak California regional routes\nAmtrak California operates multiple-times-daily regional rail services to cities across the state:\n\nPacific Surfliner, from San Diego to San Luis Obispo via Los Angeles (service began 1939 as San Diegan, renamed Pacific Surfliner in 2000): 13 daily round trips, most of which originate and terminate here; three run to Goleta and two run to San Luis Obispo.\nConnections to the San Joaquins to Oakland or Sacramento are provided through Amtrak Thruway services. (see below)\n\nMetrolink\nThe station is the hub for Metrolink and six of Metrolink's eight lines serve the station:\n\nAntelope Valley Line, to Lancaster (service began 1992)\nRiverside Line, to Riverside (service began 1993)\nOrange County Line, to Oceanside (service began 1990 as the Amtrak Orange County Commuter)\nSan Bernardino Line, to San Bernardino (service began 1992)\nVentura County Line, to Ventura (service began 1992)\n91\/Perris Valley Line, to Perris (service began 2002)\n\nMetro Rail\nThree Metro Rail lines serve the station with about 300 Metro Rail trains departing every weekday. The B and D lines are heavy rail, and share a platform underground, while the A Line uses tracks one and two outside.\n\nMetro Rail B and D lines\nThe Metro Rail B and D subway lines have their eastern terminus at Union Station and share two tracks below Union Station. There are two entrances to the platform: one is located inside Union Station's main concourse on the west side of the complex, near Alameda Street, and the other is located near the Patsaouras Transit Plaza on the east side of the complex.\n\nMetro Rail A Line\nThe Metro Rail A Line is a light rail line that passes through Union Station as it travels between Azusa and Long Beach. Trains use Tracks 1 and 2 of Union Station's 14 outdoor tracks. The platform is accessible via staircase and elevator from the main passenger tunnel. From the Gold line's opening on July 26, 2003, until the segment to East Los Angeles opened on November 15, 2009, this station was the southern terminus. The platform features an art installation, entitled Images of Commonality\/Nature and Movement, created by Beth Thielen.\nThe platform station was formerly served by the L Line, which permanently closed on June 16, 2023, for the opening of the Regional Connector. The A Line now services the tracks north of Little Tokyo\/Arts District, including Union Station.\n\nMetro Busway\nMetro J Line\nOne Metro Busway bus rapid transit line makes a stop at the Patsaouras Transit Plaza. The Metro Busway J Line operates between El Monte Bus Station, Downtown Los Angeles, Harbor Gateway Transit Center and select trips to San Pedro using the El Monte Busway and Harbor Transitway.\n\nBus and coach services\nLong-distance motorcoach\nAmtrak Thruway\nAmtrak California operates several motorcoach routes under the Amtrak Thruway brand from Union Station using dedicated bus bays at the north side of the station.\nConnections to San Joaquins trains are provided through bus route 1 that travel to and from the Bakersfield Amtrak Station. Direct rail service to Bakersfield is not possible because passenger trains are not normally allowed on the Tehachapi Loop near Bakersfield. When trains are not running during the overnight hours several bus routes provide service along the Pacific Surfliner route (to Santa Barbara, San Diego and select intermediate stations) and the San Joaquin route (to Fresno and select intermediate stations.):\n\nRoute 1: Bakersfield \u2013 Los Angeles \u2013 Santa Ana \u2013 San Diego\n\nFlixbus\nWhile it does not stop on the Union Station property, Flixbus provides intercity service to destinations across the Western United States from a parking lot across the street from the station on the northwest corner of Cesar Chavez Avenue and Vignes Street.\n\nGreyhound\nGreyhound Lines operates its main Los Angeles station from the Patsaouras Transit Plaza.

Trains can only enter or exit from the north side of the station. The configuration forces trains without cab-cars to slowly reverse in or out of the station and trains heading to or from the south to make a near-180 degree turn. Compounding the problem, is that while the station has 14 boarding tracks, multiple trains must squeeze onto just 5 tracks.\nOriginally, there were more tracks at \"the throat\", but Metrolink had some removed to allow for faster speeds along the curves in and out of the station to improve efficiency as they enter or exit the station. This choke-point can delay arriving trains as they are forced to wait outside of the station to allow a departing train to exit the station. Departures are usually given priority, to free up platforms and to keep them from experiencing delays along their route.\nTherefore, Metro has proposed the Link Union Station (Link US, formerly named  Southern California Regional Interconnector) Project, which would extend tracks 3\u201310 as run-through tracks, which will exit Union Station and cross over the El Monte Busway and US Route 101\/Santa Ana Fwy on a long, elevated \"S-curve\" that will tie into the existing tracks along the Los Angeles River. The plan also includes tracks along the river that would create a \"loop\" around the station allowing all trains (including those to\/from the north or west) to use the run-though tracks.\nMetro authorized preliminary engineering for the project in July 2012. A Request For Proposals (RFP) for Link Union Station was being prepared as of June 2013. The $31-million contract for the engineering work on the project was approved on April 24, 2014. The project's estimated value is $350 million.\nDuring construction, several tracks may be taken out of service due to their extension. To make up for the temporary loss of those platforms, track 13 was revitalized for use and tracks 14 & 15 were re-constructed. The project was completed on October 17, 2012. Once the Link US project is finished, the run-through tracks and tracks 13\u201314 will be in regular use (track 15 will be used for storage), resulting in a 40% increase in track capacity.\nOn July 27, 2019, the Metro board officially approved and certified the Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR) for the Link US Union Station run-through tracks project. The FIER has an expanded central concourse hallway to replace the new elevated concourse proposed in the Draft EIR, and also eliminated the loop tracks. These modifications reduced project costs while prioritizing rider convenience while transferring between trains. A funding plan for the project was approved on April 21, 2020, with the project's Phase A completion targeted for 2028.\nIn 2021, this project began construction, causing partial closure of platforms at this station. As of October 2023, Metro estimates that the first phase of the project will open in 2028.\n\nFormer Run-Through Tracks Project\nCalifornia Department of Transportation (Caltrans) and the Federal Railroad Administration previously drafted a plan to create run-through tracks at Union Station, but the project involved just four tracks and lacked the station \"loop\" limiting usage of the tracks just to trains heading to or from the south.\nThe final environmental impact report for the \"Los Angeles Union Station Run-Through Tracks Project\" was published by the FRA in November 2005.\n\nCalifornia High-Speed Rail\nUnion Station is planned to be a major hub for the future California High-Speed Rail System. Upon completion, it is projected that passengers will be able to get from Union Station to the Salesforce Transit Center in the city of San Francisco in 2 hours and 40 minutes.\nAs a part of its Master Plan, Metro studied how to best integrate tracks and platforms for high-speed trains arrival into Union Station. Options included an aerial structure above the existing platforms, an underground structure under Alameda Street, an underground structure under Vignes Street and an aerial structure east of Vignes. All plans include a new concourse for high-speed rail passengers and three platforms with six tracks.\nSince that time, the Link US project has resulted in changes to how High-Speed Rail (HSR) will be brought into Union Station. That project's Final Environmental Report (FEIR) released in June 2019 indicates that HSR will approach the station from the north, on tracks 3 thru 6, use rebuilt station platforms 2 and 3, then exit to the south onto a new viaduct over the El Monte Busway and Santa Ana Freeway, which curves east (over a rebuilt and relocated Commercial Street) to return to the existing rail corridor along the west bank of the Los Angeles River. Thus, only four tracks and two platforms at Union Station will be used for HSR, with the remaining six tracks being converted to thru status and using the new viaduct to be shared by Metrolink and Amtrak lines. Tracks 13 thru 15 will remain stubs, ending at the south side of the station.\nConstruction on the run-thru track is expected to start between 2023-2025 with a planned completion between 2028-2033.\n\nSoutheast Gateway Line\nMetro selected Union Station as the eventual northern terminus of the planned Southeast Gateway Line in 2022. The new light rail line will serve new platforms either at the Forecourt or behind the Metropolitan Water District Building and may open as early as 2043.\n\nDodger Stadium gondola\nThe Los Angeles Aerial Rapid Transit Project is a proposed aerial gondola connecting the station to Dodger Stadium.\n\nBrightline West\nThe proposed Brightline West high speed line is scheduled to begin construction between Las Vegas and Rancho Cucamonga in late 2023 and is expected to be operational in mid-late 2027. It is planned to connect to Los Angeles Union Station via existing Metrolink services, though Metrolink schedules will line up with Brightline schedules to allow for transfers.\n\nDreamstar Lines\nDreamstar Lines intends to launch an overnight passenger train service from Union Station to San Francisco 4th and King Street Station in 2025.\n\nIn popular culture\nThe facility served as a backdrop for the 1950 film Union Station, which starred William Holden and Nancy Olson. It has since been used in numerous films as a filming location, typically as a stand in for other fictional locations, including:\n\nUnion Station has been featured in numerous television shows, such as Adam-12, 24, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and Euphoria.\nIt has also been featured in video games; Union Station, as it was in the late 1940s, appears in L.A. Noire, while a smaller fictionalized version of the station appears in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas as Unity Station.\nUnion Station was featured in Visiting... with Huell Howser Episode 222.\nThe music videos of Backstreet Boys' \"Chances\", Fiona Apple's \"Paper Bag,\" \"Drops of Jupiter\" by American band Train, directed by Nigel Dick; and \"Last Train Home\" by John Mayer, directed by Cameron Duddy; were filmed in Union Station. A significant portion of the music video for \"Vermilion\" by the band Slipknot was filmed within Union Station.\n\nSee also\nList of Registered Historic Places in Los Angeles\nLos Angeles Metro Rail\nLos Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority\nLos Angeles Metro Rail rolling stock\nMartin F.

It generally parallels Interstate 10 (I-10) and State Route 60 (CA 60), and is the original alignment of U.S. Route 60 (US 60). The present north end of I-710 is at Valley Boulevard in Los Angeles, just west of Alhambra.\n\nRoute description\nThe road begins northeast of downtown Los Angeles at the intersection of North Main Street and North Mission Road, passing through the University Hills district at the northernmost edge of the Cal State LA campus and then through Alhambra. It ends at the interchange with CA 71 in Pomona, continuing east through Pomona as Holt Avenue and entering Montclair as Holt Boulevard. Portions of the boulevard are also part of El Camino Real.\nAfter Holt Boulevard passes through Ontario, it merges with I-10; a few miles eastward from there, another piece of Valley Boulevard splits from I-10 in Fontana, running through Rialto to I-10 in eastern Colton. When the old alignment next splits, in San Bernardino, it is known as Redlands Boulevard.\nFor most of its length, Valley Boulevard runs parallel to the Union Pacific (formerly Southern Pacific) Railroad.\n\nDescription\nValley Boulevard (former US 60, US 70 and US 99) is a vital and growing professional and business sector that includes many Asian markets, eateries and other service-oriented businesses such as physicians and dentists. There are multiple Asian banks and Asian owned and operated enterprises that accommodate the burgeoning Asian population.\nThe Asian communities in the San Gabriel Valley follow along a 25-mile (40 km) stretch of Valley Boulevard covering the entire length of the San Gabriel Valley with Alhambra on the west side and Diamond Bar on the east side. Asian communities in the San Gabriel Valley extend as far north as San Marino and Arcadia and as far south as Hacienda Heights and Rowland Heights.\nValley Boulevard begins at Lincoln Park, off North Main Street near downtown Los Angeles, about a mile northeast of the downtown Los Angeles Chinatown. From North Main Street, Valley runs east along a five-mile (8 km) stretch including large industrial tracts and the largely Hispanic community of Lincoln Heights. Midway between downtown Chinatown to the west and the start of the ethnic Chinese suburbs to the east is the Ming Ya Buddhist Temple, on Valley Boulevard in Lincoln Heights.\nFrom Los Angeles, Valley Boulevard enters Alhambra, the \"Gateway to the San Gabriel Valley\". Alhambra, which is 47% Asian according to the 2000 census, has a large number of Asian businesses along Valley Boulevard. Alhambra's Valley Boulevard boasts numerous noodle shops, Asian caf\u00e9s and the original Sam Woo Barbecue restaurant. The artful Wing Lung Bank features the largest glass tile mural in North America, composed of 996,000 3\/4\" glass tiles. Each year, Alhambra and San Gabriel host one of the largest Lunar Chinese New Year celebrations in the country which includes a parade along Valley Boulevard.\n\nContinuing east from Alhambra along Valley Boulevard are the cities of San Gabriel and Rosemead with San Marino, Temple City and Arcadia being further north and east. These five cities have Asian populations between 40 and 55% with a large number of Asian businesses in their various town centers. Along Valley Boulevard in San Gabriel are dozens of Asian mini-malls and hundreds of shops and restaurants. San Gabriel Square is one of the most prominent and features a 99 Ranch Market, several shops and restaurants including specialties such as Taiwanese and Vegetarian food. Valley Boulevard in San Gabriel also includes the comprehensive San Gabriel Superstore which includes multiple vendors anchored by a large grocery store.\nContinuing east from Rosemead further along Valley are the largely Hispanic communities of El Monte and La Puente and large industrial tracts, including those that dominate the City of Industry. This ten-mile-long (16 km), largely industrial corridor includes many Asian owned wholesale businesses, including importers of electronics, food and furniture from Asia. North of La Puente is West Covina which is 26% Asian and south of La Puente is Hacienda Heights which is 36% Asian Hacienda Heights is home to the Hsi Lai Temple, the largest Buddhist temple in the United States. The temple encompasses 15 acres (61,000 m2) and a floor area of 102,432 sq ft (9,516.2 m2). The temple's Ming Dynasty (1368\u20131644 AD) and Qing Dynasty (1644\u20131911 AD) architecture is faithful to the traditional style of buildings, Chinese gardens, and statuary of ancient Chinese monasteries. Hsi Lai was built to serve as a spiritual and cultural center for those interested in learning Buddhism and Chinese culture.\nOn the east side of the San Gabriel Valley, before Valley Boulevard becomes Holt Avenue in Pomona, are the communities of Rowland Heights, Walnut and Diamond Bar. These three communities each have Asian populations of between 50 and 60%. Rowland Heights offers its own mini ethnic suburbia, including the businesses lining Colima Road (about one mile (1.6 km) south of Valley), Fullerton Road and Nogales Street. Indoor malls in Rowland Heights feature fine restaurants and chic Asian boutiques.\n\nHistory\nSeveral old alignments are present:\n\nIn downtown El Monte, the old road is now Valley Mall; a new alignment has been built a block to the north.\nA road named Old Valley Boulevard exists in La Puente, where the new alignment crosses over a railroad on a bridge. The old road originally crossed near Unruh Avenue, and later moved to Hacienda Boulevard.\nThe road originally crossed the railroads in western Pomona via Pomona Boulevard, present CA 71 and 2nd Street into downtown Pomona.\nThe road was once known as Main Street between El Monte and La Puente and Pomona Boulevard between La Puente and Pomona. Main Street became Valley Boulevard between 1933 and 1942, and Pomona Boulevard was renamed (except for the old section in Pomona) by 1959.\nWhen US 60 was first extended to Los Angeles ca. 1932, it ran along Valley Boulevard. The new alignment (Ramona Boulevard and Garvey Avenue, now partly the San Bernardino Freeway) was built ca. 1934, taking US 60 off Valley Boulevard. Pre-1964 Legislative Route 77 was defined in 1931 to run from downtown Los Angeles to Pomona along Valley Boulevard, and then to continue east to Riverside and south to San Diego. The part from the east city limit of Los Angeles (just east of the north end of CA 7, now I-710) to I-10 in El Monte was assigned the State Route 212 number in the 1964 renumbering, and in 1965 it was removed from the state highway system.\nBus service from Downtown Los Angeles to El Monte is served by Metro Local line 76. Bus service east of El Monte is served by Foothill Transit line 194.\n\nMajor intersections\nLandmarks\nAsian businesses in the San Gabriel Valley follow along a 25-mile (40 km) stretch covering the entire length of the valley.\nGarfield Theater (Alhambra, California)\nGateway Plaza Monument (Alhambra)\nThe Hat sign (Valley Boulevard and Garfield Avenue)\n4351 Valley Boulevard, Los Angeles, Office originally built in 1930 for 60,000 SF warehouse in their back lot, now USC Facility office  (Los Angeles)\n\nSee also\n California portal\n Greater Los Angeles portal\n U.S. roads portal\n\n\n== References ==","226":"Van Nuys Boulevard is a major north-south arterial road that runs through the central  San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles County, California. The boulevard was notable for its cruising lifestyle that was prevalent in the 1960s and 1970s, which was depicted in the 1979 film Van Nuys Blvd.\n\nHistory\nWhen Van Nuys was plotted in 1911, the main thoroughfare and its offshoots were called Sherman Way. The Pacific Electric San Fernando Line interurban railway was constructed north to San Fernando between 1911 and 1913 largely in the boulevard's median strip. As the town developed, North Sherman Way was renamed Van Nuys Boulevard as the main boulevard in the town of Van Nuys, which got its name from longtime Valley wheat farmer Isaac Newton Van Nuys. Sherman Way, named for entrepreneur and Valley developer Gen. Moses Hazeltine Sherman, originally included segments of the thoroughfares known today as Chandler and Van Nuys boulevards. Rails were removed from the street by 1981.\n\nGeography\nVan Nuys Boulevard runs approximately ten miles from the Santa Monica Mountains in Sherman Oaks at its southern terminus to the foothills of the western end of the San Gabriel Mountains in Lake View Terrace at its northern terminus.  It passes through the affluent community of Sherman Oaks, then continues through the community of Van Nuys, passing the numerous automobile dealerships in southern Van Nuys, then passing through the Van Nuys Municipal Center, the government center of the San Fernando Valley, then continuing north through Panorama City, past the old General Motors plant now converted into a shopping plaza called \u201cThe Plant,\u201d before veering north east through the communities of Arleta and Pacoima, passing the San Fernando Gardens housing project, and ending in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains.\nWith its wide expanse through the heart of the San Fernando Valley, Van Nuys Boulevard became known from the 1950s through the 1970s as a center of teenage cruising.  Its car culture was celebrated in several motion pictures, including Van Nuys Boulevard.  Cruising became a thing of the past as police cracked down on the practice, but the car culture still lives on through the numerous automobile dealerships that line both sides of Van Nuys Boulevard in northern Sherman Oaks and southern Van Nuys.\nVan Nuys Boulevard has several bus routes running on it, including two Metro routes with heavy ridership, Metro Rapid line 761 and Metro Local line 233. Van Nuys is currently the only arterial bus corridor in the San Fernando Valley running New Flyer XN60 articulated buses for both lines (previously operated by NABI 60-BRT buses). The Metro G Line has a station at Van Nuys. Further to the north, there is a Metrolink and Amtrak station. In the first half of the 20th century, Pacific Electric interurban trains ran in the median of Van Nuys Boulevard from Chandler Boulevard to Parthenia Street, which would then continue to Sepulveda Boulevard; traces of this route can be seen in the large medians of the streets the tracks used to run on.\nMetro is currently proposing a light rail line from the G Line station to San Fernando along Van Nuys Boulevard as part of the East San Fernando Valley Light Rail Transit Project.\n\nCommunities along Van Nuys Boulevard (south to north)\nSherman Oaks - south of  Oxnard Boulevard; population 28,601 (78.6% White (not Hispanic); 8.5% Hispanic; 5.4% Asian)\nVan Nuys \u2013 between Oxnard Boulevard and Roscoe Boulevard; population 136,443 (50.3% Hispanic; 34.1% White (not Hispanic); 6.5% Asian; 5.9% African-American)\nPanorama City - between Roscoe Boulevard and Woodman Avenue; population 65,235 (70.1% Hispanic; 11.6% Asian; 11.9% White (not Hispanic))\nArleta \u2013 between Woodman Avenue and I-5; population 32,092 (71.4% Hispanic; 13.4% White (not Hispanic); 11.7% Asian)\nPacoima - between I-5 and Foothill Boulevard; population 58,908 (89.2% Hispanic; 5.2% African-American)\nLake View Terrace \u2013 northeast of Foothill Boulevard; population 30,759 (58.6% Hispanic; 19.7% White (not Hispanic); 15.3% African-American; 4.8% Asian)\n\nLandmarks along Van Nuys Boulevard (south to north)\nThe Village at Sherman Oaks - The Village at Sherman Oaks is the name given to the shopping and dining area surrounding the intersection of Ventura Boulevard and Van Nuys Boulevard.\nSherman Oaks Hospital and Grossman Burn Center - Sherman Oaks Hospital is a 153-bed acute care facility on Van Nuys Boulevard in Sherman Oaks.

The Van Nuys Municipal Court building in Van Nuys, California was designed by architect Dan Dworsky and received the Kaufman & Broad Award for Outstanding New Public or Civic Project for the design.  The federal building in Van Nuys was renamed the James C. Corman Federal Building in 2001 in honor of James C. Corman who represented the San Fernando Valley\u2019s 21st Congressional District from 1961-1981.  The $34 million Marvin Braude Constituent Services Center was originally proposed by Marvin Braude; it opened in 2003 and houses various city services.\nValley Municipal Building - Constructed in 1932 and designed by Peter K. Schabarum, the Valley Municipal Building (sometimes called Van Nuys City Hall) is a San Fernando Valley landmark and is considered a good example of the WPA-era \"Zig-Zag Moderne\" architectural styling.

Its academic roots were established in 1881 as a normal school then known as the southern branch of the California State Normal School which later evolved into San Jos\u00e9 State University. The branch was transferred to the University of California to become the Southern Branch of the University of California in 1919, making it the second-oldest of the ten-campus University of California system after the University of California, Berkeley.\nUCLA offers 337 undergraduate and graduate degree programs in a range of disciplines, enrolling about 31,600 undergraduate and 14,300 graduate and professional students annually. It received 174,914 undergraduate applications for Fall 2022, including transfers, making it the most applied-to university in the United States. The university is organized into the College of Letters and Science and twelve professional schools. Six of the schools offer undergraduate degree programs: Arts and Architecture, Engineering and Applied Science, Music, Nursing, Public Affairs, and Theater, Film and Television. Three others are graduate-level professional health science schools: Medicine, Dentistry, and Public Health. Its three remaining schools are Education & Information Studies, Management and Law.\nUCLA student-athletes compete as the Bruins in the Big Ten Conference. They won 123 NCAA team championships while in the Pac-12 Conference, second only to Stanford University's 128 team titles. 410 Bruins have made Olympic teams, winning 270 Olympic medals: 136 gold, 71 silver and 63 bronze. UCLA has been represented in every Olympics since the university's founding (except in 1924) and has had a gold medalist in every Olympics in which the U.S. has participated since 1932.\nAs of March 2024, 16 Nobel laureates, 11 Rhodes scholars, two Turing Award winners, two Chief Scientists of the U.S. Air Force, one Pritzker prize winner, 7 Pulitzer prize winners, two U.S. Poet laureates, one Gauss prize winner, and one Fields Medalist have been affiliated with it as faculty, researchers and alumni. As of March 2024, 59 associated faculty members have been elected to the National Academy of Sciences, 17 to the American Philosophical Society, 32 to the National Academy of Engineering, 42 to the National Academy of Medicine, 10 to the National Academy of Inventors, and 167 to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nHistory\nIn March 1881, at the request of state senator Reginaldo Francisco del Valle, the California State Legislature authorized the creation of a southern branch of the California State Normal School (now San Jos\u00e9 State University) in downtown Los Angeles to train teachers for the growing population of Southern California. The Los Angeles branch of the California State Normal School opened on August 29, 1882, on what is now the site of the Central Library of the Los Angeles Public Library system. The facility included a demonstration school where teachers-in-training could practice their techniques with children. That elementary school would become the present day UCLA Lab School. In 1887, the branch campus became independent and changed its name to Los Angeles State Normal School.\nIn 1914, the school moved to a new campus on Vermont Avenue (now the site of Los Angeles City College) in East Hollywood. In 1917, UC Regent Edward Augustus Dickson, the only regent representing the Southland at the time, and Ernest Carroll Moore, Director of the Normal School, began to lobby the State Legislature to enable the school to become the second University of California campus, after UC Berkeley. They met resistance from UC Berkeley alumni, Northern California members of the state legislature and then-UC President Benjamin Ide Wheeler, who were all vigorously opposed to the idea of a southern campus. However, David Prescott Barrows, the new President of the University of California in 1919, did not share Wheeler's objections.\n\nOn May 23, 1919, the Southern Californians' efforts were rewarded when Governor William D. Stephens signed Assembly Bill 626 into law, which acquired the land and buildings and transformed the Los Angeles Normal School into the Southern Branch of the University of California. The same legislation added its general undergraduate program, the Junior College. The Southern Branch campus opened on September 15 of that year, offering two-year undergraduate programs to 250 Junior College students and 1,250 students in the Teachers College. While University of Southern California students criticized the \"branch\" as a mere \"twig\", Southern Californians continued to fight Northern Californians for the right to three and then four years of instruction. In December 1923, the Board of Regents authorized a fourth year of instruction and transformed the Junior College into the College of Letters and Science, which awarded its first bachelor's degrees in June 1925.\nUnder UC President William Wallace Campbell, enrollment at the Southern Branch expanded so rapidly that by the mid-1920s the institution was outgrowing the 25 acre Vermont Avenue location. The Regents announced the new \"Beverly Site\" \u2014 just west of Beverly Hills \u2014 in 1925. After the athletic teams entered the Pacific Coast conference in 1926, the Southern Branch student council adopted the nickname \"Bruins\", a name offered by the student council at UC Berkeley. On February 1, 1927, the Regents renamed the Southern Branch the University of California at Los Angeles. In the same year, the state broke ground in Westwood on land sold for $1 million, less than one-third its value, by real estate developers Edwin and Harold Janss, for whom the Janss Steps are named. The campus in Westwood opened to students in 1929.\nThe original four buildings were the College Library (now Powell Library), Royce Hall, the Physics-Biology Building (which became the Humanities Building and is now the Renee and David Kaplan Hall), and the Chemistry Building (now Haines Hall), arrayed around a quadrangular courtyard on the 400 acre (1.6 km2) campus. The first undergraduate classes on the new campus were held in 1929 with 5,500 students. UCLA was permitted to award the master's degree in 1933, and the doctorate in 1936, against continued resistance from UC Berkeley.\n\nMaturity as a university\nDuring its first 32 years, UCLA was treated as an off-site department of the main campus in Berkeley. As such, its presiding officer was called a \"provost.\" In 1951, UCLA was formally elevated to coequal status with UC Berkeley, and its presiding officer Raymond B. Allen was the first chief executive to be granted the title of chancellor. In November 1958, the \"at\" in UCLA's name was replaced with a comma, a symbol of its independence from Berkeley.\nThe appointment of Franklin David Murphy to the position of chancellor in 1960 helped spark an era of tremendous growth of facilities and faculty honors. This era secured UCLA's position as a proper university in its own right and not simply a branch of the UC system.\n\nRecent history\nOn June 1, 2016, two men were killed in a murder-suicide at an engineering building in the university. School officials put the campus on lockdown as Los Angeles Police Department officers, including SWAT, cleared the campus. In February 2022, Matthew Harris, a former lecturer and postdoctoral fellow at UCLA, was arrested after allegedly making numerous threats of violence against students and faculty members of UCLA's Philosophy Department.\nIn 2018, a student-led community coalition known as \"Westwood Forward\" successfully led an effort to break UCLA and Westwood Village away from the existing Westwood Neighborhood Council and form a new North Westwood Neighborhood Council, with over 2,000 out of 3,521 stakeholders voting in favor of the split. Westwood Forward's campaign focused on making housing more affordable and encouraging nightlife in Westwood by opposing many of the restrictions on housing developments and restaurants the Westwood Neighborhood Council had promoted. In 2022, UCLA signed an agreement to partner with the Tongva for the caretaking and landscaping of various areas of the campus. This included land use for ceremonial events and educational workshops and outreach events.\nOn April 25, 2024, an occupation protest began at UCLA to protest the administration's investments in Israel amid the Israel\u2013Hamas war. On April 28, clashes occurred between pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel protesters as Stand With Us rallied on the campus, in a protest organised by the Israeli American Council. On May 1, violent clashes were reported on the UCLA campus between pro-Palestinian protesters and groups of counter-demonstrators supporting Israel.\nAs part of the pro-Palestinian protests, students set up encampments on UCLA grounds. The university provided the encampment with private security and metal barricades \u201cto prevent violent confrontations between... protesters.\u201d Ultimately, however, the anti-Israel protestors did not allow students who refused to denounce Israel onto UCLA campus grounds, which was viewed as a \u201cJew Exclusion Zone\u201d by many students on campus. UCLA did not prevent the misuse of their resources that were used to deny Jewish students access to Royce Quad, a central part of UCLA's campus.\nIn June 2024, three Jewish students filed a lawsuit against UCLA, alleging \u201cthat the university played a role in preventing them from accessing the campus freely during protests, when they were blocked from entering the pro-Palestinian encampment erected by protesters.\u201d The students were represented by Becket Law. In July 2024, a federal judge ordered that UCLA must \u201ccreate a plan to ensure Jewish students have equal access to campus\u201d as a result of the lawsuit.\n\nCampus\nThe new UCLA campus in 1929 had four buildings: Royce Hall and Haines Hall on the north, and Powell Library and Kinsey Hall (now called Renee And David Kaplan Hall) on the south. The Janss Steps were the original 87-step entrance to the university that lead to the quad of these four buildings. Today, the campus includes 163 buildings across 419 acres (1.7 km2) in the western part of Los Angeles, north of the Westwood shopping district and just south of Sunset Boulevard. In terms of acreage, it is the second-smallest of the ten UC campuses. The Channel Islands are visible from the UCLA campus.\n\nArchitecture\nThe first buildings were designed by the local firm Allison & Allison. The Romanesque Revival style of these first four structures remained the predominant building style until the 1950s, when architect Welton Becket was hired to supervise the expansion of the campus over the next two decades. Romanesque Revival was chosen as an alternative to Collegiate Gothic to parallel the climate of Southern California to the warm, sunny weather of the Southern Mediterranean.\nBecket greatly streamlined its general appearance, adding several rows of minimalist, slab\u2013shaped brick buildings to the southern half, the largest of these being the UCLA Medical Center. Architects such as A. Quincy Jones, William Pereira, and Paul Williams designed many subsequent structures on the campus during the mid-20th century. More recent additions include buildings designed by architects I.M. Pei, Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates, Richard Meier, Cesar Pelli, and Rafael Vinoly. To accommodate UCLA's rapidly growing student population, multiple construction and renovation projects are in progress, including expansions of the life sciences and engineering research complexes. This continuous construction gives UCLA the nickname \"Under Construction Like Always\".\nOne notable building on campus is named after African-American alumnus Ralph Bunche, who received the 1950 Nobel Peace Prize for negotiating an armistice agreement between the Jews and Arabs in Israel. The entrance of Bunche Hall features a bust of him overlooking the Franklin D. Murphy Sculpture Garden. He was the first individual of non-European background and the first UCLA alumnus to be honored with the Prize.\nThe Hannah Carter Japanese Garden is located a mile north of campus, in the community of Bel Air. The garden was designed by landscape architect Nagao Sakurai of Tokyo and garden designer Kazuo Nakamura of Kyoto in 1959. The garden was donated to UCLA by former UC regent and UCLA alumnus Edward W. Carter and his wife Hannah Carter in 1964 with the stipulation that it remains open to the public. After the garden was damaged by heavy rains in 1968, UCLA Professor of Art and Campus Architect Koichi Kawana took on the task of its reconstruction. The property was sold in 2016 and public access is no longer required.\n\nFilming\nUCLA has attracted filmmakers for decades with its proximity to Hollywood. It was used to represent fictional Windsor College in Scream 2 (1997). In response to frequent requests for filming at the campus, UCLA has instated a policy to regulate filming and professional photography.\n\"UCLA is located in Los Angeles, the same place as the American motion picture industry\", said UCLA visiting professor of film and television Jonathan Kuntz. \"So we're convenient for (almost) all of the movie companies, TV production companies, commercial companies and so on. We're right where the action is.\"\n\nAcademics\nCollege and schools\nCollege and schools of the university - with the year of their founding - include:\n\nHealthcare\nThe David Geffen School of Medicine, School of Nursing, School of Dentistry and Fielding School of Public Health constitute the professional schools of health science. The UCLA Health System operates the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, a hospital in Santa Monica and twelve primary care clinics throughout Los Angeles County. In addition, the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine uses two Los Angeles County public hospitals as teaching hospitals\u2014Harbor\u2013UCLA Medical Center and Olive View\u2013UCLA Medical Center\u2014as well as the largest private nonprofit hospital on the west coast, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. The Greater Los Angeles VA Medical Center is also a major teaching and training site for the university.\nThe UCLA Medical Center made history in 1981 when Assistant Professor Michael Gottlieb first diagnosed AIDS. UCLA medical researchers also pioneered the use of positron emission tomography (PET) scanning to study brain function. Professor of Pharmacology Louis Ignarro was one of the recipients of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discovering the signaling cascade of nitric oxide, one of the most important molecules in cardiopulmonary physiology. The U.S. News & World Report Best Hospitals ranking for 2021 ranks UCLA Medical Center 3rd in the United States and 1st in the West. UCLA Medical Center was ranked within the top 20 in the United States for 15 out of 16 medical specialty areas examined.\n\nResearch\nUCLA is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities \u2013 Very high research activity\" and had $1.32 billion in research expenditures in 2018.\n\nRankings\nNational\nThe 2024 U.S. News & World Report Best Colleges report ranked UCLA first among public universities and tied for 15th among national universities.

It is the United States' 12th largest library in number of volumes. The first library, University Library (presently Powell Library), was founded in 1884. Lawrence Powell became librarian in 1944, and began a series of system overhauls and modifications, and in 1959, was named Dean of the School of Library Service. More libraries were added as previous ones filled.\n\nMedical school admissions\nAccording to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), UCLA supplies the most undergraduate applicants to U.S. medical schools among all American universities. In 2015, UCLA supplied 961 medical school applicants, followed by UC Berkeley with 819 and the University of Florida with 802. Among first-time medical school applicants who received their bachelor's degree from UCLA in 2014, 51% were admitted to at least one U.S. medical school.\n\nAdmissions\nUndergraduate\nU.S. News & World Report rates UCLA \"Most Selective\" and The Princeton Review rates its admissions selectivity of 98 out of 99. 149,815 prospective freshmen applied for Fall 2021, the most of any four-year university in the United States.\nAdmission rates vary according to the residency of applicants. For Fall 2019, California residents had an admission rate of 12.0%, while out-of-state U.S. residents had an admission rate of 16.4% and internationals had an admission rate of 8.4%. UCLA's overall freshman admit rate for the Fall 2019 term was 12.3%.\nAs of 2020, the basis for selection at UCLA includes several academic and nonacademic factors. Those considered \"very important\" are all academic; they are rigor of secondary school record, academic GPA, standardized test scores, and application essay(s). Those considered \"important\" are talent\/ability, character\/personal qualities, volunteer work, work experience, and extracurricular activities. Factors that are not considered at all include class rank, interviews, alumni relation, and racial\/ethnic status. UCLA is need-blind for domestic applicants.\nEnrolled freshman for Fall 2019 had an unweighted GPA of 3.90, an SAT interquartile range of 1280\u20131510, and an ACT interquartile range of 27\u201334. The SAT interquartile ranges were 640\u2013740 for reading\/writing and 640\u2013790 for math. Among the admitted freshman applicants for the Fall 2019 term, 43.1% chose to enroll at UCLA.\nUCLA's freshman admission rate varies drastically across colleges. For Fall 2016, the College of Letters and Science had an admission rate of 21.2%, the Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science (HSSEAS) had an admission rate of 12.4%, the Herb Alpert School of Music had an admission rate of 23.5%, the School of the Arts and Architecture had an admission rate of 10.3%, the School of Nursing had an admission rate of 2.2%, and the School of Theater, Film and Television had an admission rate of 4.4%.\nOne of the major issues is the decreased admission of African-Americans since the passage of Proposition 209 in 1996, prohibiting state governmental institutions from considering race, sex, or ethnicity, specifically in the areas of public employment, public contracting, and public education. UCLA responded by shifting to a holistic admissions process in Fall 2007, which evaluates applicants based on their opportunities in high school, personal hardships, and unusual circumstances at home.\n\nGraduate\nFor Fall 2020, the David Geffen School of Medicine admitted 2.9% of its applicants, making it the 8th most selective U.S. medical school. The School of Law had a median undergraduate GPA of 3.82 and median Law School Admission Test (LSAT) score of 170 for the enrolled class of 2024. The Anderson School of Management had a middle-80% GPA range of 3.1\u20133.8 and an average Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) score of 711 for the enrolled MBA class of 2024.\nThe School of Dentistry had an average overall GPA of 3.65, an average science GPA of 3.6 and an average Dental Admissions Test (DAT) score of 22.8 for the enrolled class of 2025. The Graduate School of Nursing has an acceptance rate of 33% as of 2022. For Fall 2020, the Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science (HSSEAS) had a graduate acceptance rate of 27%.\n\nEconomic impact\nThe university has a significant impact in the Los Angeles economy. It is the fifth largest employer in the county (after Los Angeles County, the Los Angeles Unified School District, the federal government and the City of Los Angeles) and the seventh largest in the region.\n\nTrademarks and licensing\nThe UCLA trademark \"is the exclusive property of the Regents of the University of California\", but it is managed, protected, and licensed through UCLA Trademarks and Licensing, a division of the Associated Students UCLA, the largest student employer on campus. As such, the ASUCLA also has a share in trademark profits.\nApparel, fashion accessories and other items with UCLA'S logo and insignea are popular in many parts of the world due to both the university's academic and athletic prestige, and its association with colorful images of Southern California life and culture. This demand for UCLA-branded merchandise has inspired the licensing of its trademark to UCLA brand stores throughout Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Since 1980, 15 UCLA stores have opened in South Korea, and 49 are currently open in China. The newest store recently opened in Kuwait; there are also stores in Mexico, Singapore and India. UCLA earns about $400,000 in royalties each year through its international licensing program.\n\nCommerce on campus\nUCLA has various store locations around campus, with the main store in Ackerman Union. In addition, UCLA-themed products are sold at the gift shop of Fowler Museum on campus. Due to licensing and trademarks, products with UCLA logos and insignia are usually higher priced than their unlicensed counterparts. These products are popular among visitors, who buy them as gifts and souvenirs. The UCLA store offers some products, such as notebooks and folders, in both licensed (logoed) and cheaper unlicensed (un-logoed) options, but for other products the latter option is often unavailable. Students employed part-time by ASUCLA at UCLA Stores and Restaurants receive discounts when they shop at UCLA Stores.\n\nAthletics\nThe school's sports teams are called the Bruins, represented by the colors true blue and gold. The Bruins participate in NCAA Division I as part of the Big Ten Conference. Two notable sports facilities serve as home venues for UCLA sports. The Bruin men's football team plays home games at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena; the team won a national title in 1954. The basketball and volleyball teams, and the women's gymnastics team compete at Pauley Pavilion on campus. The school also sponsors cross country, soccer, women's rowing, golf, tennis, water polo, track and field, and women's softball.\nThe mascots are Joe and Josephine Bruin, and the fight songs are Sons of Westwood and Mighty Bruins. The alma mater is Hail to the Hills of Westwood. When Henry \"Red\" Sanders came to UCLA to coach football in 1949, the uniforms were redesigned. Sanders added a gold loop on the shoulders\u2014the UCLA Stripe. The navy blue was changed to a lighter shade of blue. Sanders figured that the baby blue would look better on the field and in film. He dubbed the uniform \"Powder Keg Blue\", a powder blue with an explosive kick. This would also differentiate UCLA from all other UC teams, whose official colors are blue and gold.\nUCLA competes in all major Division I sports and has won 135 national championships, including 123 NCAA championships. Only Stanford University has more NCAA team championships, with 135. On April 21, 2018, UCLA's women's gymnastics team defeated Oklahoma Sooners to win its 7th NCAA National Championship as well as UCLA's 115th overall team title. Most recently, UCLA's women's soccer team defeated Florida State to win its first NCAA National Championship along with women's tennis who defeated North Carolina to win its second NCAA National title ever. UCLA's softball program is also outstanding. Women's softball won their NCAA-leading 12th National Championship, on June 4, 2019. The women's water polo team is also dominant, with a record 7 NCAA championships. Notably, the team helped UCLA become the first school to win 100 NCAA championships overall when they won their fifth on May 13, 2007.\nThe men's water polo team won UCLA's 112th, 113th, and 114th national championships, defeating USC in the championship game three times: on December 7, 2014, on December 6, 2015, and on December 3, 2017. On October 9, 2016, the top-ranked men's water polo team broke the NCAA record for consecutive wins when they defeated UC Davis for their 52nd straight win. This toppled Stanford's previous record of 51 consecutive wins set in 1985\u201387. The men's water polo team has become a dominant sport on campus with a total of 11 national championships.\nAmong UCLA's 123 championship titles, some of the more notable victories are in men's basketball. Under legendary coach John Wooden, UCLA men's basketball teams won 10 NCAA championships, including a record seven consecutive, in 1964, 1965, 1967\u20131973, and 1975, and an 11th was added under then-coach Jim Harrick in 1995 (through 2008, the most consecutive by any other team is two). From 1971 to 1974, UCLA men's basketball won an unprecedented 88 consecutive games.\nUCLA has also shown dominance in men's volleyball, with 21 national championships. The first 19 teams were led by former coach Al Scates.  UCLA is one of only six universities (Michigan, Stanford, Ohio State, California, and Florida being the others) to have won national championships in all three major men's sports (baseball, basketball, and football).\n\nUSC rivalry\nUCLA shares a traditional sports rivalry with the University of Southern California. UCLA teams have won the second-most NCAA Division I-sanctioned team championships, while USC has the third-most. Only Stanford University, a fellow Pac-12 member also located in California, has more than either UCLA or USC. The football rivalry is distinctive for two of the strongest conference programs located in one city. In football, UCLA has one national champion team and 16 conference titles, compared to USC's 11 national championships and 37 conference championships. The two football teams compete for annual possession of the Victory Bell, the trophy of the rivalry football game.\nThe schools share a rivalry in many other sports, and are each the best in the nation for many. UCLA has won 19 NCAA Championships in men's volleyball, 11 in men's basketball, 12 in Softball, and 7 in women's water polo, the most of any school in those sports. USC has won 26 NCAA Championships in Men's Outdoor Track and Field, 21 in men's tennis, and 12 in baseball, also the most of any school in each respective sport. The annual SoCal BMW Crosstown Cup compares the two schools based on their performance in 19 varsity sports; UCLA has won five times and USC has won nine times. This rivalry extends to the Olympic Games, where UCLA athletes have won 250 medals over a span of 50 years while USC athletes have won 287 over 100 years. UCLA and USC also compete in the We Run The City 5K, an annual charity race to raise donations for Special Olympics Southern California. The race is located on the campus of one of the schools and switches to the other campus each year. USC won the race in 2013 and 2015, while UCLA won the race in 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2017.\n\nStudent life\nThe campus is located near prominent entertainment venues such as the Getty Center, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) and the Santa Monica Pier. UCLA offers classical orchestras, intramural sports, and over 1000 student organizations  UCLA is also home to 66 fraternities and sororities, which represent 13% of the undergraduate population. Phrateres, a non-exclusive social-service club for women was founded here in 1924 by the Dean of Women, Helen Matthewson Laughlin. Students and staff participate in dinghy sailing, surfing, windsurfing, rowing, and kayaking at the UCLA Marina Aquatic Center in Marina del Rey.\nUCLA is home to a slew of performing arts groups, including an improv comedy team called Rapid Fire. UCLA's first contemporary a cappella group, Awaken A Cappella, was founded in 1992. The all-male group, Bruin Harmony, has enjoyed a successful career since its inception in 2006, portraying a collegiate a cappella group in The Social Network (2010), while the ScatterTones finished in second-place in the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA) in 2012, 2013, and 2014, and third-place in 2017, 2019, and 2022. In 2020, The A Cappella Archive ranked the ScatterTones at #2 among all ICCA-competing groups. Resonance, founded in 2012, was an ICCA finalist in 2021. Other a cappella groups include Signature, Random Voices, Medleys, YOUTHphonics, Deviant Voices, AweChords, Pitch Please, Da Verse, Naya Zaamana, Jewkbox, On That Note, Tinig Choral, and Cadenza. YOUTHphonics and Medleys are UCLA's only nonprofit service-oriented a cappella groups.\nThere are a variety of cultural organizations on campus, such as Nikkei Student Union (NSU), Japanese Student Association (JSA), Association of Chinese Americans (ACA), Chinese Students and Scholars Association (CSSA), Chinese Music Ensemble (CME), Chinese Cultural Dance Club (CCDC), Taiwanese American Union (TAU), Taiwanese Student Association (TSA), Hong Kong Student Society (HKSS), Hanoolim Korean Cultural Awareness Group, Samahang Pilipino, Vietnamese Student Union (VSU), and Thai Smakom. Many of these organizations have an annual \"culture night\" consisting of drama and dance which raises awareness of culture and history to the campus and community.\nAdditionally, there are over twenty LGBTQ organizations on campus, including the undergraduate student organizations Queer Alliance, BlaQue, Lavender Health Alliance, OutWrite Newsmagazine, Queer and Trans in STEM (qtSTEM), and Transgender UCLA Pride (TransUP) as well as the graduate student organizations Out@Anderson, OUTLaw, and Luskin PRIDE. Notably, OutWrite, established under the name TenPercent in 1979, is the first college queer newsmagazine in the country. The UCLA Center for LGBTQ+ Advocacy, Research & Health was founded in 2020. UCLA operates on a quarter calendar with the exception of the UCLA School of Law and the UCLA School of Medicine, which operate on a semester calendar.\n\nTraditions\nUCLA's official charity is UniCamp, founded in 1934. It is a week-long summer camp for under-served children from the greater Los Angeles area, with UCLA volunteer counselors. UniCamp runs for seven weeks throughout the summer at Camp River Glen in the San Bernardino National Forest. Because UniCamp is a non-profit organization, student volunteers from UCLA also fundraise money throughout the year to allow these children to attend summer camp.\nThe Pediatric AIDS Coalition organizes the annual Dance Marathon in Pauley Pavilion, where thousands of students raise a minimum of $250 and dance for 26 hours to support the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, Project Kindle, and the UCLA AIDS Institute. Dancers are not allowed to sit (except to use the restroom) during the marathon, literally taking a stand against pediatric AIDS, and symbolizing the suffering of affected children around the world. In 2015, Dance Marathon at UCLA raised $446,157.\nDuring Finals Week, UCLA students participate in \"Midnight Yell\", where they yell as loudly as possible for a few minutes at midnight to release some stress from studying. The quarterly Undie Run takes place during the Wednesday evening of Finals Week, when students run through the campus in their underwear or in skimpy costumes. With the increasing safety hazards and Police and Administration involvement, a student committee changed the route to a run through campus to Shapiro Fountain, which culminates with students dancing in the fountain. The Undie Run has spread to other American universities, including the University of Texas at Austin, Arizona State University, and Syracuse University.\n\nThe Alumni Association sponsors several events, usually large extravaganzas involving huge amounts of coordination, such as the 70-year-old Spring Sing, organized by the Student Alumni Association (SAA). UCLA's oldest tradition, Spring Sing is an annual gala of student talent, which is held at either Pauley Pavilion or the outdoor Los Angeles Tennis Center. The committee bestows the George and Ira Gershwin Lifetime Achievement Award each year to a major contributor to the music industry. Past recipients have included Stevie Wonder, Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, James Taylor, Ray Charles, Natalie Cole, Quincy Jones, Lionel Richie, and in 2009, Julie Andrews. The Dinner for 12 Strangers is a gathering of students, alumni, administration and faculty to network around different interests. The \"Beat 'SC Bonfire and Rally\" occurs the week before the USC rivalry football game.\nThe USAC Cultural Affairs Commission hosts the JazzReggae Festival, a two-day concert on Memorial Day weekend that attracts more than 20,000 attendees. The JazzReggae Festival is the largest entirely student produced and run event of its kind on the West Coast.\nSigma Eta Pi and Bruin Entrepreneurs organize LA Hacks, an annual hackathon where students from around the United States come to build technology products. LA Hacks established itself as the largest hackathon in the United States when over 1500 students participated on April 11\u201313, 2014. LA Hacks also holds the record for the most funds raised via corporate sponsorships with $250,000 raised. Some of the tech world's most prominent people have given talks and judged projects at LA Hacks, including Evan Spiegel (Founder and CEO of Snapchat), Alexis Ohanian (co-founder of Reddit), Sam Altman (President of Y Combinator) and Chris De Wolfe (Founder of Myspace).\n\nStudent government\nThe Associated Students UCLA (ASUCLA) encompasses the student government and student-led enterprises at UCLA. ASUCLA has four major components: the Undergraduate Students Association, the Graduate Students Association, Student Media, and Services & Enterprises. However, in common practice, the term ASUCLA refers to the services and enterprises component. This includes the Student Store, Bookstore, Food Services, Student Union, etc. These commercial enterprises generate approximately $40 million in annual revenues. As a nonprofit corporation, the financial goal of ASUCLA is to provide quality services and programs for students. ASUCLA is governed by a student-majority Board of Directors. The Undergraduate Students Association and Graduate Students Association each appoint three members plus one alternative. In addition to the student members, there are representatives appointed by the administration, the academic senate, and the alumni association. The \"services and enterprises\" portion of ASUCLA is run by a professional executive director who oversees some 300 staff and 2,000 student employees.\nThe Graduate Students Association is the governing body for approximately 13,000 graduate and professional students at UCLA. The Undergraduate Students Association Council (USAC) is the governing body of the Undergraduate Students Association (USA) whose membership comprises every UCLA undergraduate student. As of 2015, the student body had two major political slates: Bruins United and Let's Act. In the Spring 2016 election, the two competing parties were Bruins United and Waves of Change\u2014a smaller faction that broke off of Lets Act.\nUSAC's fifteen student officers and commissioners are elected by members of the Undergraduate Students Association at an annual election held during Spring Quarter. In addition to its fifteen elected members, USAC includes appointed representatives of the Administration, the Alumni, and the Faculty, as well as two ex-officio members, the ASUCLA Executive Director and a student Finance Committee Chairperson who is appointed by the USA President and approved by USAC. All members of USAC may participate fully in Council deliberations, but only the elected officers, minus the USAC President may vote. Along with the council, the student government also includes a seven-member Judicial Board, which similar to the Supreme Court, serves as the judicial branch of government and reviews actions of the council. These seven students are appointed by the student body president and confirmed by the council.\nUSAC's programs offers additional services to the campus and surrounding communities. For example, each year approximately 40,000 students, faculty and staff attend programs of the Campus Events Commission, including a low-cost film program, a speakers program which presents leading figures from a wide range of disciplines, and performances by dozens of entertainers. Two to three thousand UCLA undergraduates participate annually in the more than twenty voluntary outreach programs run by the Community Service Commission. A large corps of undergraduate volunteers also participate in programs run by the Student Welfare Commission, such as AIDS Awareness, Substance Abuse Awareness, Blood Drives and CPR\/First Aid Training. The film program is part of the Bruin Film Society, which is also a registered organization to host advance screenings of films during Oscars season. It hosts other events, like filmmaker panels, through its partnership with production and distribution company A24.\n\nMedia publications\nUCLA Student Media is the home of UCLA's newspaper, magazines, and radio station. Most student media publications are governed by the ASUCLA Communications Board. The Daily Bruin is UCLA's most prominent student publication. Founded in 1919 under the name Cub Californian, it has since then developed into Los Angeles' third-most circulated newspaper. It has won dozens of national awards and is regularly commended for layout and content. In 2016, the paper won two National Pacemaker Awards \u2013 one for the best college newspaper in the country, and another for the best college media website in the country. \n\nUCLA Student Media also publishes seven special-interest news magazines: Al-Talib, Fem, Ha'Am, La Gente, Nommo, Pacific Ties, and OutWrite, a school yearbook, BruinLife, and the student-run radio station, UCLA Radio. Student groups such as The Forum for Energy Economics and Development also publish yearly journals focused on energy technologies and industries. There is also a student-run satire newspaper, The Westwood Enabler. There are also numerous graduate student-run journals at UCLA, such as Carte Italiane, Issues in Applied Linguistics, and Mediascape. Many of these publications are available through open access. The School of Law publishes the UCLA Law Review which is currently ranked seventh among American law schools.\n\nHousing\nUCLA provides housing to over 10,000 undergraduate and 2,900 graduate students. Most undergraduate students are housed in 14 complexes on the western side of campus, referred to by students as \"The Hill\". Students can live in halls, plazas, suites, or university apartments, which vary in pricing and privacy. Housing plans also offer students access to dining facilities, which have been ranked by the Princeton Review as some of the best in the United States. Dining halls are located in Covel Commons, Rieber Hall, Carnesale Commons and De Neve Plaza. In winter 2012, a dining hall called The Feast at Rieber opened to students. The newest dining hall (as of Winter Quarter 2014) is Bruin Plate, located in the Carnesale Commons (commonly referred to as Sproul Plaza). Residential cafes include Bruin Cafe, Rendezvous, The Study at Hedrick, and Cafe 1919. UCLA currently offers four years guaranteed housing to its incoming freshmen, and two years to incoming transfer students. There are four types of housing available for students: residential halls, deluxe residential halls, residential plazas, and residential suites. Available on the hill are study rooms, basketball courts, tennis courts, and Sunset Recreational Center which includes three swimming pools.\nGraduate students are housed in one of five apartment complexes. Weyburn Terrace is located just southwest of the campus in Westwood Village. The other four are roughly five miles south of UCLA in Palms and Mar Vista. They too vary in pricing and privacy. Approximately 400 students live at the University Cooperative Housing Association, located two blocks off campus. Students who are involved in Greek life have the option to also live in Greek housing while at UCLA. Sorority houses are located east of campus on Hilgard Avenue, and fraternity houses are located west of campus throughout Westwood Village. A student usually lives with 50+ students in Greek housing.\n\nHospitality\nHospitality constituents of the university include departments not directly related to student life or administration. The Hospitality department manages the university's two on-campus hotels, the UCLA Guest House and the Meyer and Renee Luskin Conference Center. The 61-room Guest House services those visiting the university for campus-related activities. The department also manages the UCLA Conference Center, a 40-acre (0.2 km2) conference center in the San Bernardino Mountains near Lake Arrowhead. Hospitality also operates UCLA Catering, a vending operation, and a summer conference center located on the Westwood campus.\n\nChabad House\nThe UCLA Chabad House is a community center for Jewish students operated by the Orthodox Jewish Chabad movement. Established in 1969, it was the first Chabad House at a university. In 1980, three students died in a fire in the original building of the UCLA Chabad House. The present building was erected in their memory. The building, completed in 1984, was the first of many Chabad houses worldwide designed as architectural reproductions of the residence of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson at 770 Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn, New York. The Chabad House hosts the UCLA chapter of The Rohr Jewish Learning Institute's Sinai Scholars Society.\n\nHealthy Campus Initiative\nIn January 2013, Chancellor Gene Block launched the UCLA Healthy Campus Initiative (HCI), envisioned and supported by Jane and Terry Semel. The Semel HCI prioritizes the health and wellness of UCLA students, staff, and faculty by \"making the healthy choice the easy choice.\" The goal of the initiative is to make UCLA the healthiest campus in the country, and to share best practices and research with other communities, locally and beyond. The initiative is a campuswide, multi-year effort that champions programs such as the tobacco-free policy, expansion of campus gardens, stairwell makeovers, bicycle infrastructure improvements, healthy and sustainable dining options, and peer counseling, among others.\nThe UCLA Healthy Campus Initiative is credited with providing inspiration for national initiatives including the Partnership for a Healthier America (PHA) Healthier Campus Initiative and the University of California Office of the President (UCOP) Global Food Initiative (GFI). In November 2014, UCLA was one of the 20 inaugural colleges and universities to pledge to adopt PHA's guidelines for food and nutrition, physical activity and programming over three years. The Semel HCI is a member of both the Menus of Change Research Collaborative and the Teaching Kitchen Collaborative, and a contributor to The Huffington Post.\n\nFaculty and alumni\nAward laureates and scholars\nUCLA's faculty and alumni have won a number of awards including:\n\n\tNotable UCLA alumni include:\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nAs of October 2023, 28 Nobel laureates have been affiliated with UCLA: 12 professors, 8 alumni and 10 researchers (three overlaps).

It was originally known as West 16th Street under the Los Angeles numbered street system.\n\nRoute description\nThe western terminus of Venice Boulevard is Ocean Front Walk in Venice. Proceeding easterly, it assumes the designation California State Route 187 crossing Lincoln Boulevard (State Route 1). The route then passes through the Mar Vista neighborhood. Further east, it  briefly forms the boundary between Palms and Culver City and passes near Sony Pictures Studios. Continuing northeast into the Crestview neighborhood in West Los Angeles, the SR 187 designation terminates at the intersection with Cadillac Avenue and the ramp carrying traffic from westbound I-10. Continuing to parallel  Washington Boulevard directly to its south, as it does for much of its length, the route proceeds between the Picfair Village neighborhood in West Los Angeles and Lafayette Square in Mid-City, through the Mid-Wilshire district, through Arlington Heights and Harvard Heights, dips under the Harbor Freeway, and continues into the heart of downtown Los Angeles, where it turns into East 16th Street at Main Street.\n\nHistory\nA street railway was built on 16th Street by the Los Angeles Traction Company in 1896. An extra rail was installed in 1905, which created a dual-gauge streetcar thoroughfare which was shared with the Los Angeles Railway. The line eventually came under the control of the Pacific Electric Railway, which operated it until the end of 1950. The Venice Boulevard Local ran regular service to Vineyard Junction, while the Venice Short Line ran the length of Venice Boulevard from Pacific Avenue to Hill Street. The narrow gauge Los Angeles Railway A Line ran on Venice between Hill and Burlington Avenue until 1946.\nPrior to 1932, West 16th Street ended at Crenshaw Boulevard. In that year part of the Pacific Electric right of way was taken and Venice Boulevard was cut through from La Brea Avenue to Crenshaw. At that time West 16th Street was renamed Venice Boulevard.\n\nPublic transportation\nMetro Local line 33 operates on Venice Boulevard. The Metro E Line serves a rail station at its intersection with Robertson Boulevard.\n\nLandmarks\nVenice High School is located near the intersection with Walgrove Avenue.\nLoyola High School is located by Venice and Vermont Avenue.\nThe Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery also lies on Venice.\n\nSee also\nPico\/Rimpau\n\nReferences\n\n\n== External links ==","229":"Ventura Boulevard is one of the primary east\u2013west thoroughfares in the San Fernando Valley region of the City of Los Angeles, California. Ventura Boulevard is one of the oldest routes in the San Fernando Valley as it is along the commemorative route El Camino Real. It was also U.S. Route 101 (US 101) before the freeway (which it parallels for much of Ventura Boulevard's length) was built, and it was also previously signed as U.S. Route 101 Business (US 101 Bus.).\nApproximately 18 miles (29 km) long, Ventura Boulevard begins near Calabasas in Woodland Hills at an intersection with Valley Circle Boulevard. The Boulevard travels through Tarzana, Encino, and Sherman Oaks before intersecting with Lankershim Boulevard in Studio City, where it becomes Cahuenga Boulevard and winds through Cahuenga Pass into Hollywood.\nIt has always been the most concentrated location for small businesses and shops in the Valley; nowadays it has pockets of housing, mini-malls, and shops, along with a wide assortment of businesses, schools, and other establishments. Homes south of Ventura Boulevard are considered to be among the most expensive in Los Angeles County, ranging from $2 million to $50 million and home to numerous celebrities, executives, athletes, and entertainers alike.\n\nHistory\nVentura Boulevard follows an ancient pre-Columbian trading trail that served the Tataviam and Tongva village of Siutcanga, which is at least 4,000 years old.\nDue to natural springs in the area, one of the first inhabited areas of the San Fernando Valley was the land around what is now known as Los Encinos State Historic Park, at the corner of Balboa and Ventura boulevards, which was inhabited by the Tongva for thousands of years. This 5-acre (2 hm\u00b2) park now includes the original nine-room De La Osa Adobe (built in 1849) and a reservoir shaped like a Spanish guitar that collects the springwater.\nThe Valley's first golf course opened at the corner of Ventura and Coldwater Canyon in 1922 (this is now the site of the Sportsmen's Lodge).\nAlso in 1922, around the area of Canoga Avenue south of Ventura Boulevard, Victor Girard purchased 2,886 acres (12 km\u00b2) of land and planted over 120,000 pepper, sycamore, and eucalyptus trees, later resulting in the appropriately named Woodland Hills.\nIn 1928, just a couple blocks east of Laurel Canyon, Mack Sennett created his 38-acre (15.4 hm\u00b2) Keystone Studios, which produced silent movies with stars such as Fatty Arbuckle, W.C. Fields, Stan Laurel, and the Keystone Cops. After talkies, Keystone became Republic Pictures, and then in 1963 CBS Studio Center. Although closed to the public, this complex, which is located only a few blocks away from Ventura Boulevard, probably makes more TV sitcoms than any other studio.\n\nIn 2015 the Studio City section of Ventura Boulevard, along with Lankershim Boulevard, was the site of CicLAvia, an event sponsored by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority in which major roads are temporarily closed to motorized vehicle traffic and used for recreational human-powered transport.\n\nPublic transportation\nVentura Boulevard carries Metro Local lines 150 and 240.\n\nIn popular culture\nMusic\nThe Everly Brothers recorded a song called \"Ventura Boulevard\" on their 1968 album Roots. \nVentura Boulevard is mentioned in Tom Petty's song \"Free Fallin'\" (\"All the vampires walkin' through the valley, Move west down Ventura Boulevard...\"). When Petty died in 2017, what was intended as a walk by four fans turned into a public memorial as 10 times that many \u2018Vampires\u2019 walked west down the Boulevard in memory of the singer.\nThe Boulevard is also mentioned in Frank Zappa's \"Valley Girl\" (\"On Ventura, there she goes, she just bought some bitchin' clothes\") a song about a valley girl (voiced by his daughter Moon Zappa) who lives in Encino and participates in typical Valley Girl activities such as shopping at The Galleria, not wanting to do the dishes, and getting her toenails professionally pedicured.\nGuitarist John 5 made a song entitled \"18969 Ventura Blvd.\"\nIn the documentary Living with Michael Jackson, it is revealed that Michael Jackson wrote the song Billie Jean while riding down Ventura Boulevard in his car.\nHaim's music video \"Want You Back\" is filmed on Ventura Boulevard.\n\nFilm\nThe boulevard is a prominent location in the movie The 40-Year-Old Virgin. Much of the films Crash and Transformers were filmed on the boulevard.\n\nTelevision\nIn the Seinfeld episode \"The Trip, Part 2\", Jerry and George were said to be calling from a pay phone on Ventura Boulevard. In reality, the pay phone shown was on Ventura Place, about one block away.\nIn the Treehouse of Horror VI episode of The Simpsons, Ventura Boulevard features as the location of the show's first ever live-action scene.\nSteve Allen, who lived in Encino, famously joked that \"The Valley is the hippest part of town. They even named a boulevard after Charlie Ventura,\" referring to the renowned jazz saxophonist.\n\nLiterature\nDetective fiction author Raymond Chandler on Ventura Boulevard from his novel The Little Sister (1949):\n\nAt La Brea I turned north and swung over to  Highland, out over Cahuenga Pass and on to Ventura Boulevard, past Studio City and  Sherman Oaks and Encino. There was nothing lonely about the trip. There never is on that road. Fast boys in stripped-down Fords shot in and out of the traffic streams, missing fenders by a sixteenth of an inch, but somehow always missing them. Tired men in dusty coup\u00e9s and sedans winced and tightened their grip on the wheel and ploughed on north and west towards home and dinner...I drove past the gaudy neon\u2019s and the false fronts behind them, the sleazy hamburger joints that look like palaces under the colors, the circular drive-ins as gay as circuses with chipper hard-eye car-hops...Behind Encino an occasional light winked...from the homes of screen stars. Screen stars, phooey...\u201d\n\nVideo games\nVideo game developer Infinity Ward, which developed most of the games in the Call of Duty series, has its headquarters on Ventura Boulevard. The studios can be seen at 15821 Ventura Boulevard, Encino.\n\nBusiness district\nThe Ventura Business District is the commercial district along and around Ventura Boulevard. Ventura Boulevard and the district run along the northern base of the Santa Monica Mountains. Mission bells have been placed marking the commemorative route of the El Camino Real.\n\nNeighborhoods\nDue to the district's extended linear size, it is rare for it to be considered one unified district, instead identified by neighborhoods within and along it.\nThey include:\n\nStudio City\nSherman Oaks\nEncino\nTarzana\nWoodland Hills\n\nSee also\nHistory of the San Fernando Valley to 1915\nIndex: San Fernando Valley\n\nGallery of places along Ventura Boulevard (east to west)\nReferences\n\n\n== External links ==","230":"Vermont\/Sunset station is an underground rapid transit (known locally as a subway) station on the B Line of the Los Angeles Metro Rail system.

With a length of 23.3 miles (37.5 km), is the third longest of the north\u2013south thoroughfares in the region. For most of its length between its southern end in San Pedro and south of Downtown Los Angeles, it runs parallel to the west of the Harbor Freeway (I-110).\n\nRoute description\nVermont Avenue's southern point is just north of San Pedro at a five-point intersection with Anaheim Street, Gaffey Street and Palos Verdes Drive. After a short distance, Normandie Avenue branches off due north while Vermont turns northeast towards its intersection with Pacific Coast Highway (PCH). Afterwards, it travels roughly in a straight line north for 22 miles (35 km), parallel to the Harbor Freeway (I-110) to the east. North of PCH, it passes through the unincorporated area of West Carson before crossing the San Diego Freeway (I-405).\nBetween a point south of the intersection with Artesia Boulevard\/western end of the Gardena Freeway (SR 91), and El Segundo Boulevard, Vermont marks the eastern boundary of the City of Gardena. At 164th Street in Gardena, Vermont widens from a four-lane thoroughfare to a six-lane road with a wide median. From 164th Street, an abandoned railway runs through the median to a point just north of Redondo Beach Boulevard, afterwards the median becomes tree-lined. From 88th Street to Gage Avenue, Vermont Avenue includes adjacent frontage roads. North of Gage, Vermont thins down to 4 lanes.\nVermont Avenue then passes at the western end of the University of Southern California and Exposition Park in South Los Angeles. In August 2012, the City of Los Angeles designated a portion of Vermont Avenue in Pico-Union as the \"El Salvador Community Corridor.\"\nBetween the Santa Monica Freeway (I-10) and the Hollywood Freeway (US 101), Vermont Avenue crosses Wilshire Boulevard and passes through Koreatown. It then forms the eastern boundary of the East Hollywood district of Hollywood as it passes through Little Armenia. It intersects Sunset Boulevard, next to the Children's Hospital Los Angeles, and Hollywood Boulevard, to the east of the Barnsdall Art Park. At the intersection with Los Feliz Boulevard, it becomes a divided road with one lane in each direction as it heads to Griffith Park. Entering the park, it then becomes signed as Vermont Canyon Road before it passes by the Greek Theatre.

Initial plans call for a bus rapid transit line to operate along the corridor. In the future, Measure M funding is expected to become available for an extension of the B Line subway down Vermont Avenue at least as far as the neighborhood of Athens (just south of the 105 Freeway), possibly as a combination of both underground and elevated heavy rail. Bus rapid transit implementation is expected as part of the Twenty-eight by '28 initiative, in anticipation of the 2028 Summer Olympics. Rail funding is planned for 2067.

Victory Boulevard is the street where one will find the West Valley's major malls at Fallbrook Center and Westfield Topanga, through the Warner Center business district, along a section of the Metro G Line and by three of its stations, past Pierce College, through the Sepulveda Basin Recreation Center with Lake Balboa, Pedlow Skate Park and golf courses, then through the communities of Van Nuys, Valley Glen and North Hollywood in the center of the valley, crossing the Tujunga Wash, and continuing past Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery with its Portal of the Folded Wing, through Burbank's entertainment district, passing the Nickelodeon studios at Olive Avenue, then veering southeast to its eastern terminus at Griffith Park near the Los Angeles Zoo and Travel Town Museum (at the intersection of Riverside Drive & Sonora Avenue).\nVictory Boulevard is one of three Los Angeles boulevards mentioned in Randy Newman's song \"I Love L.A.\".\n\nHistory\nWhen Van Nuys was plotted in 1911, Victory Boulevard was called 7th Avenue. Around 1916, the name was changed to Leesdale Avenue when the city of Los Angeles annexed the San Fernando Valley after the Los Angeles Aqueduct was completed.  In the mid-1920s, the Leesdale Improvement Association unveiled plans to expand Leesdale Avenue as an 80-foot (24 m)-wide \"great east-and-west boulevard\" through the Valley.  At that time, the city also changed the name to Victory Boulevard, in honor of soldiers returning from World War I, and paved the boulevard as far west as Balboa Boulevard where it ended.

It was established under its current name in 1993, being co-owned by actors and 21 Jump Street co-stars Johnny Depp and Sal Jenco. The Viper Room has undergone several changes in ownership, with the present owner being Viper Holdings, Ltd CEO James Cooper. It continues to host music of multiple genres, including metal, punk, and alternative rock. While predominantly known as a music venue, the Viper Room also has a lower level which is home to a large whiskey bar.\nThe club became known as a hangout spot for the young Hollywood elite, and gained infamy for its drug-related incidents; actor River Phoenix had a fatal drug overdose in 1993, actor Jason Donovan suffered a drug-induced seizure in 1995 but survived, and singer Courtney Love survived an overdose in 1995 after Depp gave her CPR. In 1997, singer Michael Hutchence played his last public performance in the Viper Room before taking his own life a week later.\n\nHistory\nThe location was originally a grocery store from 1921 into the 1940s. In the 1940s, it was converted into a nightclub called the \"Cotton Club\", entirely unrelated to the Harlem original. This was soon replaced by \"The Greenwich Village Inn\", the \"Rue Angel\" and finally \"The Last Call\" during the 1940s.  From 1951 to 1969, the location was a bar called \"The Melody Lounge\".  In 1969, it became \"Filthy McNasty's\". and in the 1980s, a jazz club called \"The Central\". \n\"The Central\" was best known for its Tuesday jam nights where various well-known musicians such as Joe Cocker, Brian Setzer and Jeff Baxter performed and hung out along with others in the music industry.  It also hosted many local music acts such as Chuck E. Weiss who was frequently accompanied by the Goddamn Liars.  In 1993, the club was close to shutting down when Weiss suggested to Depp that he should revitalize the spot and rename it \"The Viper Room\".  Tom Waits also had a hand in redeveloping the spot.\n\nThe venue\nDespite the death of River Phoenix the year the venue opened, the club became and remained a hangout for Hollywood's most popular young actors and musicians. Adam Duritz, the lead singer of Counting Crows, worked as a Viper Room bartender in late 1994 and early 1995 to escape his newfound fame.\n\nOwnership\nAs part of the settlement of a lawsuit against Johnny Depp and four others, involving allegations of mismanagement of profits, Depp relinquished his ownership of the Viper Room in 2004. The club changed hands multiple times between 2004 and 2016; the club is currently owned by Viper Room Holdings, Ltd. CEO James Cooper.\n\nIntellectual property and lawsuits\nA nightclub formerly called \"The Viper Room\" exists in Cincinnati. The club changed its name to \"The Poison Room\" on January 1, 2006, after they were told by the West Hollywood Viper Room to stop using the name. Another \"Viper Room\" in Portland was also told to stop using the name under threat of a trademark lawsuit, with the Viper Room's former owner claiming that \"every dollar they make is the result of using our name\". Abroad, there is also a legal brothel in Brisbane called \"The Viper Room\" and nightclubs boasting the name (or a similar one) in Harrogate, Sheffield, Stockholm, and Vienna.\nUntil February 2009, there was a nightclub with the same name in Melbourne; it was closed down due to a spate of violent incidents that included two shootings as well as license breaches and the arrest of a co-owner on drug charges. On April 16, 2011, a nightclub named \"The Viper Room\" opened its doors in the city of Nijmegen in the Netherlands.

The Boulevard extends eastbound to the city of Whittier, at Whittier Boulevard. It is south of Venice Boulevard for most of its length. At Wade Street, Washington Place is formed adjacent and parallel and lasts until just east of Sepulveda Boulevard, where it merges back into Washington Boulevard. Washington merges into Culver Boulevard briefly, but forms back into its own street at Canfield Avenue.\nWashington Boulevard, which is primarily four lanes but has some six-lane sections, passes through locations in the mid-southern portion of Los Angeles County. The communities to the west include affluent areas such as Marina del Rey and Ladera Heights. Further east it passes between Crestview and Culver City and through Mid City, Arlington Heights, Pico Union, City of Commerce, Montebello, Pico Rivera, Los Nietos and Whittier.\n\nHistory\nIn early days the western portion of Washington was known as the Ballona Road. The far eastern end was known as the Los Angeles and Anaheim Telegraph Road.\n\nIn 1905, it boasted the headquarters of the local horse driving club, for a mile west of Western Avenue. \"The road is not of the best,\" reported the Los Angeles Times, \"and automobiles are usurping it . . . but it is the nearest approach to a speedway the reinsmen have, and they therefore make the most of it.\" Mayor Owen McAleer \"has set aside that stretch of the highway to those drivers who delight in vying with each other off the racetrack, and policemen have been given to understand that some latitude is to be allowed horsemen there.\"\n\nTransportation\nWashington Boulevard provides bus service between Venice Beach and West LA Transit Center by Culver City Transit line 1, between West LA Transit Center and Downtown by Metro Local line 35, and east of Downtown by Montebello Transit line 50.

Incorporated in 1984, it is home to the Sunset Strip. As of the 2020 U.S. Census, its population was 35,757.\n\nHistory\nMost historical writings about West Hollywood begin in the late-18th century with European colonization when the Portuguese explorer Jo\u00e3o Rodrigues Cabrilho traveled to and eventually laid claim on the region for Spain. Around 5,000 of the indigenous inhabitants from the Tongva Indian tribe canoed out to greet the ship. The Tongva tribe was a nation of hunter-gatherers known for their reverence for dance and courage. By 1771, these native people had been severely ravaged by the diseases brought in by the Europeans from across wide oceans. The Spanish mission system changed the name of the Tongva tribe to \"Gabrielinos\", in reference to the Mission de San Gabriel. Early in 1770 Gaspar de Portola's Mexican expeditionary force stopped just south of the Santa Monica Mountains near what would become West Hollywood. Here they collected pitch (brea in Spanish) from tar pits which they used to waterproof their belongings and to say Mass. The Gabrielinos are believed to have burned the pitch for fuel.\nBy 1780, what became the \"Sunset Strip\" was the major connecting road for El Pueblo de Los Angeles, and all ranches westward to the Pacific Ocean. This land passed through the hands of various owners during the next one hundred years, and it was called names such as \"La Brea\" and \"Plummer\" that are listed in historical records.  Most of this area was part of the Rancho La Brea, and eventually it came to be owned by the Henry Hancock family.\n\nDuring the final decade years of the nineteenth century, the first large land reconstruction of the town of \"Sherman\" significantly accelerated the development of the region. In what would later become West Hollywood\u2014the town of \"Sherman\"\u2014was established by Moses Sherman and his partners of the Los Angeles Pacific Railroad, an interurban railroad line which later became part of the Pacific Electric Railway system. Sherman became the location of the railroad's main shops, railroad yards, and \"car barns\". Many working-class employees of the railroad settled in this town. It was during this time that the city began to earn its reputation as a loosely regulated, liquor-friendly (during Prohibition) place for eccentric people wary of government interference. Despite several annexation attempts, the town elected not to become part of the City of Los Angeles. In a controversial decision, in 1925 Sherman adopted \"West Hollywood\", \"...a moniker pioneered earlier in the decade by the West Hollywood Realty Board\" as its informal name, though it remained under the governance of Los Angeles County.\nFor many decades, the area that is now the city of West Hollywood was an unincorporated area in the midst of Los Angeles. Because gambling was illegal in the city of Los Angeles, but still legal in Los Angeles County, the 1920s saw the proliferation of many casinos, night clubs, etc., along Sunset Boulevard (which starts near downtown Los Angeles and runs westward). These businesses were immune from the sometimes heavy-handed law-enforcement of the L.A. Police Department.\nSome people connected with movie-making were attracted to this less-restricted area of the County, and a number of architecturally distinctive apartment buildings and hotels were built. Many interior designers, decorators and \"to the trade\" furnishing showrooms located in West Hollywood date back to the middle of the century.\nEventually, the area and its extravagant nightclubs fell out of favor. However, the Sunset Strip and its restaurants, saloons, and nightclubs continued to be an attraction for out-of-town tourists. During the late 1960s, the Sunset Strip was transformed again during the hippie movement which brought a thriving music publishing industry coupled with the \"hippie\" culture. Some young people from all over the country flocked to West Hollywood.\nThe most recent migration to West Hollywood came about after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, when thousands of Russian Jews immigrated to the city. A majority of the 5,000 to 6,000 Russian Jews settled in two major immigration waves, 1978\u201379 and 1988\u201392. Other than New York, West Hollywood's Russian-speaking community is the most concentrated single Russian-speaking region in the United States.\nThe Gauntlet was a body piercing business founded by Jim Ward in West Hollywood that is considered the first business of its type in the United States and was the beginning of the body piercing industry. The Gauntlet began in November 1975, with its original location in Ward's West Hollywood home, but on the evening of Friday, November 17, 1978, it celebrated the grand opening of its first commercial location at 8720 Santa Monica Boulevard (also in West Hollywood).\n\nDue to the expiration of rent control protections in LA County, a coalition of gay men, Russian Jews, and the elderly successfully held a vote to officially incorporate the City of West Hollywood in 1984; by electing a city council with an openly gay majority and immediately passing a series of rent control measures to protect its longtime citizens. West Hollywood then immediately adopted one of the strongest rent control laws in the nation.\nThe city of West Hollywood gave the keys to the city to Stormy Daniels on \"Stormy Daniels Day\", May 23, 2018.\n\nGeography\nWest Hollywood is bounded by the city of Beverly Hills on the west, and by neighborhoods of the city of Los Angeles: Hollywood Hills on the north, Hollywood on the east, the Fairfax District on the southeast, and Beverly Grove on the southwest. The city's irregular boundary is featured in its logo; it was largely formed from the unincorporated Los Angeles County area which had not become part of the surrounding cities.\nWest Hollywood benefits from a very dense, compact urban form with small lots, mixed land use, and a walkable street grid.

Major intersecting streets typically provide amenities within walking distance of adjacent neighborhoods.\n\nClimate\nWest Hollywood has a subtropical-semi-arid climate with year-round warm weather, although winter nights are cool. The record high temperature of 111 \u00b0F was recorded on September 26, 1963, while the record low of 24 \u00b0F was recorded on January 4, 1949.  Rainfall is sparse (only 13 inches annually), and falls mainly during the winter months.

The owner died in 1968, and efforts continued to have the sign removed. The Gay Liberation Front organized a zap of the restaurant on February 7, 1970, to push for its removal. The sign disappeared that day. The sign was put up and taken down several times over the next 14 years, but the practice ended in December 1984, days after the city voted itself into existence.

Its intersection with Wilshire Boulevard is one of the busiest in Los Angeles, with seven through lanes and four left turn lanes (going east\/west). Most of the large office buildings in Westwood are located on Wilshire Boulevard.\nSouth of Wilshire, Westwood Boulevard continues as a four-lane boulevard passing through many small businesses. This area of Westwood south of Wilshire Boulevard is often referred to as Tehrangeles because of its large Iranian-American population. Many of the businesses along Westwood Boulevard are Persian, reflecting these demographics. In particular, Westwood Boulevard is noted for a large number of Persian restaurants.

It is located at 8901 Sunset Boulevard on the Sunset Strip, corner North Clark Street, opposite North San Vicente Boulevard, northwest corner. The club played a central role in the Los Angeles music scene from the 1960s through the 1990s.\n\nHistory\nIn 1958, the first Whisky a Go Go in the United States opened in Chicago, Illinois, on the corner of Rush and Chestnut streets. It has been called the first real American discoth\u00e8que. A franchise was opened in 1966 on M Street in the Georgetown section of Washington, D.C., by restaurateur Jacques Vivien.\nIt owes its name to the first discoth\u00e8que, the Whisky \u00e0 Gogo, (\u00e0 gogo, meaning, in French, \"in abundance\", \"galore\"), established in Paris in 1947 by Paul Pacini (d. 2017), which itself took the name from the movie Whisky Galore! based on the British novel Whisky Galore which was released in France as Whisky a Gogo.\nThe Sunset Strip Whisky was founded by Elmer Valentine, Phil Tanzini, Shelly Davis, and attorney Theodore Flier and opened on January 16, 1964. In 1966, Valentine, Lou Adler, and others founded The Roxy Theatre. In 1972, Valentine, Adler, Mario Maglieri and others started the Rainbow Bar & Grill on the Sunset Strip. Lou Adler bought into the Whisky in the late 1970s. Valentine sold his interest in the Whisky a Go Go in the 1990s but retained an ownership in the Rainbow Bar & Grill and the Roxy Theatre until his death in December 2008.\nAlthough the club was billed as a discoth\u00e8que, suggesting that it offered only recorded music, the Whisky a Go Go opened with a live band led by Johnny Rivers and DJ Rhonda Lane, spinning records between sets from a suspended cage at the right of the stage. Shortly after opening, the club began booking live rock groups upon suggestion from their publicist, Ronnie Haran. Haran eventually hired The Doors as the Whisky house band, where they performed seven nights a week. In September 1969, the group Gypsy took over as the house band at the club  until April 1971.\n\nThe Whisky a Go Go was one of the places that popularized go-go dancing. Elmer Valentine, in a 2006 Vanity Fair article, recalled arranging to have a female DJ play records between Rivers' sets so patrons could continue dancing. But because there was not enough room on the floor for a DJ booth, he had a glass-walled booth mounted high above the floor. A contest was held for the female DJ job but when the young winner called Valentine on the night of the opening and tearfully said her mother forbade her from doing it, Valentine recruited the club's cigarette girl, Patty Brockhurst. Valentine quickly hired two more female dancers, one of whom, Joanna Labean, designed the official go-go-girl costume of fringed dress and white boots.\nRivers rode the Whisky-born go-go craze to national fame with records recorded partly Live at the Whisky. In addition, The Miracles recorded the song \"Going to a Go-Go\" in 1966 (which was covered in 1982 by The Rolling Stones), and Whisky a Go Go franchises sprang up all over the country. Arguably, the rock and roll scene in Los Angeles was born when the Whisky started operation; because of its status as a historic music landmark, the venue was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006.\n\nThe Whisky played an important role in many musical careers, especially for bands based in Southern California. The Byrds, Buffalo Springfield, Smokestack Lightnin', and Love were regulars, and the Doors were the house band for a while. Van Morrison's band Them had a two-week residency in June 1966, with the Doors as the opening act. On the last night they all jammed together on \"Gloria.\" Frank Zappa's the Mothers of Invention got their record contract based on a performance at the Whisky. The Turtles performed there when their newest (and biggest-selling) single \"Happy Together\" was becoming a hit, only to lose their new bassist, Chip Douglas (who had arranged the song), to the Monkees; guitarist Michael Nesmith invited him to become their producer (he returned to the Turtles a year later, to produce them). Neil Diamond also played at the Whisky on occasion. Metallica bassist Cliff Burton was recruited by the band after they watched him play a show there with his band Trauma. At one point, singer and actress E.G. Daily had a residency at the Whisky. On February 15, 1977, the Ramones played for the first time on this stage.\n\nArthur Lee of Love immortalized the Whisky in the song \"Maybe the People Would Be the Times or Between Clark and Hilldale\". \"Here they always play my songs,\" he would sing on the side-two opener of Forever Changes. The Whisky was located on the strip between the streets Clark and Hilldale. British rockers Status Quo also referenced the venue in their 1978 song \"Long Legged Linda\" with the lines, \"Well, if you're ever in Los Angeles and you've got time to spare \/ Take a stroll up Sunset Boulevard, you'll find the Whisky there.\" Loggins and Messina sang about the club in their tune \"Whiskey\", found on their 1972 album Loggins and Messina. \nIn 1966, the Whisky was one of the centers of what fans call the Sunset Strip police riots. In the mid-1970s, the Whisky hosted stage presentations, including the long-running show The Cycle Sluts. During the early 1990s, the Whisky hosted a number of Seattle-based musicians who would be a part of the grunge movement, including Soundgarden, Mudhoney, Melvins, Fitz of Depression and 7 Year Bitch. Tracks recorded from a February 12, 1992 concert of Hole appear on their EP, Ask for It (1995). In 1994, Oasis played a controversial set at the Whisky, with frontman Liam Gallagher visibly intoxicated. Immediately following the gig, lead songwriter Noel Gallagher temporarily left the group out of frustration, fleeing to San Francisco, where he penned the song \"Talk Tonight\". In 1997, System of a Down played at the Whisky. The band were unsigned at the time, and played songs from their early demo tapes, in particular containing the band's only live performance of the song \"Blue\".\n\nToday\nOn September 12, 2016, Whisky a Go Go launched an official TV channel on the Roku Connected TV platform. The Whisky a Go Go channel opens the Whisky's doors to a global audience with live music videos, full concerts and related content spanning its 60-year history.\n\nHonors\nA gene that codes for a subunit of a common potassium ion channel was named for the establishment in the 1960s by William D. Kaplan and William E. Trout. The human Ether-\u00e0-go-go-Related Gene (hERG) was so named because when Drosophila flies with mutations in the Ether-\u00e0-go-go gene are anaesthetised with ether, their legs start to shake, like the dancing at the Whisky a Go Go nightclub.\n\nIn popular culture\nThe 2013 videogame Grand Theft Auto V features a nightclub known as Tequi-la-la, which is based on Whisky a Go Go.\nThe 2019 song \"Kiss the Go-Goat\" by Ghost is named so because the band's fictional history consists of the band performing the song at the Whiskey a Go Go in 1969.\n\nSee also\nLive at the Whisky a Go Go (disambiguation)\nOtis Redding In Person at the Whisky a Go Go, an album recorded in 1966 at the venue\nHugh Masekela Is Alive and Well at the Whisky, a 1967 album by Hugh Masekela recorded live at the venue\nThe Troubadour\nThe Viper Room\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nThe History of The Whisky-A-Go-Go","243":"Whittier Boulevard is an arterial street that runs from the Los Angeles River (where it continues into Downtown Los Angeles as 6th Street) to Brea, California.

Lowriders want to showcase them and come together at parks, parking lots, etc. anywhere they find place and come in groups. In 1965, on weekend nights in East Los Angeles, Mexican-American teenagers would hop in their cars to cruise up and down Whittier Boulevard.\nThe 1984, Frank Romero's oil on canvas entitled The Closing Of Whittier Boulevard, 96\u201d x 144\u201d painting documents the real event that happened in the 1970s when the police closed off Whittier Boulevard to all the low riders who regularly cruised it.\n\nZoot Suit Riots\nDuring World War II, Whittier Boulevard and neighboring East LA streets went through the neighborhoods of many Pachucos.  A few Zoot Suits fights happened in East Los Angeles' streets like Whittier Boulevard. When the Zoot Suit Riots occurred in Los Angeles it was difficult to be a Latino in that area (especially around Whittier Boulevard), especially for those who wore a Zoot Suit.\n\nRecreation and other sites\nAlong the Whittier Boulevard strip is Salazar Park, named after Ruben Salazar. Salazar died as a result of injuries sustained after he was struck by a tear-gas projectile during the National Chicano Moratorium March  against the Vietnam War on August 29, 1970, in East Los Angeles, California. The park hosts baseball games, senior activities in a gym, offers a public swimming pool in the summer and classes for non-swimmers, allowing community members to have recreational activities.\nThe Spanish Churrigueresque-style theatre was designed by William and Clifford Balch, who also participated in the design of the El Rey Theatre on Wilshire Boulevard and the Fox Theatre in Pomona. The Vega Building, a historic retail building that once surrounded the theatre, suffered severe damage from the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake and was demolished in the early 1990s.

Located in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles, the beach is owned by the California Department of Parks and Recreation; it is managed and maintained by the Los Angeles County Department of Beaches and Harbors.\n\nOverview\nThe beach extends one and three quarters miles along the coast. It has many facilities, including volleyball courts, gymnastic equipment, restrooms, a playground, and a bike path. The bike path is part of the South Bay Bicycle Trail and extends 19.1 miles (30.7 km) along the shore to Torrance, California. The beach is also a popular surf spot.\nA section just south of the intersection of Pacific Coast Highway and Entrada Drive (34.026053\u00b0N 118.518824\u00b0W\ufeff \/ 34.026053; -118.518824\ufeff (Los Angeles Gay Beach)) is popular within the LGBT community and is therefore considered Los Angeles' unofficial gay beach;  this section is often referred to as Ginger Rogers Beach.\nMany films and television shows have been filmed at the beach, including Creature from the Black Lagoon, The Kiss, La Belle dame sans merci, Summer Children, Holidays with Heather, and Hangman. Also, the television show Baywatch was shot at the beach before it moved to Hawaii.\nIn the sea near Will Rogers State Beach at Sunset Blvd., there is the grounding electrode of the Pacific DC Intertie.\nThe Will Rogers State Beach lifeguard headquarters is the site of the former Port of Los Angeles Long Wharf, a California Historical Landmark, site number 881.\n\nHistory\nThe beach is named after actor, commentator and humorist Will Rogers, and partly originated with his property. In the 1920s, Rogers bought the land and developed a ranch along the coast and upland past today's Sunset Boulevard. He owned 345 acres (140 ha) in all, in what is now Pacific Palisades, beginning with about 1300 feet along the beach. Rogers died in a plane crash in 1935. Before his widow Betty's death in 1944, she developed a plan to gift their oceanfront to the state as the core of the original Will Rogers State Beach, which then ran 6,300 feet (1,900 m) of coastline in total. The beach was dedicated on July 26, 1942, with California Governor Culbert Olson and Los Angeles Mayor Fletcher Bowron on hand. \nThe nearby Will Rogers State Historic Park north of Sunset Boulevard, was formed from a similar gift by Betty Rogers of 186 acres (75 ha) of the original contiguous Rogers ranch deeded on June 8, 1944, two weeks before her death.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nWill Rogers State Historic Park\nList of beaches in California\nList of California state parks\nCalifornia State Beaches\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nWeather conditions at WatchtheWater.org\nLos Angeles County Beaches and Harbors \u2013 Will Rogers State Beach","246":"Will Rogers State Historic Park is the former estate of American humorist Will Rogers. It lies in the Santa Monica Mountains in Los Angeles, in the Pacific Palisades area.\n\nGeography\nIn what is now the Los Angeles neighborhood of Pacific Palisades, Rogers built his ranch, where he lived with his wife Betty and their three children, Will Jr., Mary and James. The 31-room ranch house, which includes 11 baths and seven fireplaces, is surrounded by a stable, corrals, riding ring, roping arena, golf course, polo field\u2014and riding and hiking trails that give visitors views of the ranch and the surrounding countryside\u2014186 acres (757,000 m2). The ranch became a State Park in 1944 after the death of Mrs. Rogers, and the house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.\nCalifornia State Parks completed a major renovation of the ranch house in 2002\u20132006. The project included reconstruction of flagstone areas that surround the house, seismic safety work, replacement of electrical systems and installation of a new heating and air conditioning system. The house reopened to the public in March 2006.\n\nBeyond the ranch and the stables are the trails that lead to views of the countryside around the park. Since Will Rogers State Historic Park is on the tip of the Santa Monica Mountains, the trails have vistas of both the sea and the mountains. Visitors can hike to Inspiration Point, take the Rogers trail around the perimeter of the park or continue on into Topanga State Park via the Backbone Trail System.\n\nHistory\nBeyond the Rogers' home, the ranch reflects Will Rogers' roots in horsemanship, starting with the polo field, which is the first thing the visitor sees when looking south from the parking area. The field is the only outdoor polo field in Los Angeles County, and the only field that is regulation size. The ranch has been in many movies and television shows, including Star Trek IV, in which it stood in for Golden Gate Park. The polo field features a gentle slope that forms an area for viewing the polo action. Up from the parking area are the ranch buildings, including the visitor center, which once was the Rogers' garage and ranch guest house. The visitor center features a film on the life of Will Rogers, photo mural displays, and literature regarding the Rogers family and their legacy reflected in the park.\nThe ranch buildings and grounds are maintained as they were when the Rogers family lived there in the late 1920s and 1930s. The living room of the main ranch house includes a collection of Native American rugs and baskets, and several original Western art works by Charles M. Russell and Ed Borein. It also features a porch swing in the center of the room and a mounted calf, which was given to Will Rogers to encourage him to rope the calf instead of his friends. The north wing of the house, also furnished in period, original family furnishings, contains the family bedrooms, Rogers' study, and the family parlor\/sunroom.\nSince 2006, the nature and historic interpretive goals of WRSHP under California State Parks operation have been amplified by stewardship and fundraising from the non-profit Will Rogers Ranch Association.

He was born as a citizen of the Cherokee Nation, in the Indian Territory (now part of Oklahoma), and is known as \"Oklahoma's Favorite Son\". As an entertainer and humorist, he traveled around the world three times, made 71 films (50 silent films and 21 \"talkies\"), and wrote more than 4,000 nationally syndicated newspaper columns. By the mid-1930s, Rogers was hugely popular in the United States for his leading political wit and was the highest paid of Hollywood film stars. He died in 1935 with aviator Wiley Post when their small airplane crashed in northern Alaska.\nRogers began his career as a performer on vaudeville. His rope act led to success in the Ziegfeld Follies, which in turn led to the first of his many movie contracts. His 1920s syndicated newspaper column and his radio appearances increased his visibility and popularity. Rogers crusaded for aviation expansion and provided Americans with first-hand accounts of his world travels. His earthy anecdotes and folksy style allowed him to poke fun at gangsters, prohibition, politicians, government programs, and a host of other controversial topics in a way that found general acclaim from a national audience with no one offended. His aphorisms, couched in humorous terms, were widely quoted, for example, \"I am not a member of an organized political party. I am a Democrat.\"\n\nOne of Rogers's most famous sayings was \"I never met a man I didn't like\" and he even provided an epigram on this famous epigram:\n\nWhen I die, my epitaph, or whatever you call those signs on gravestones, is going to read: \"I joked about every prominent man of my time, but I never met a man I dident [sic]  like.\" I am so proud of that, I can hardly wait to die so it can be carved.\n\nEarly years\nRogers was born on his parents' Dog Iron Ranch in the Cherokee Nation of Indian Territory, near present-day Oologah, Oklahoma, now in Rogers County, named in honor of his father, Clement V. Rogers. The house in which he was born had been built in 1875 and was known as the \"White House on the Verdigris River\". His parents, Clement V. (Clem) Rogers (1839\u20131911) and Mary America Schrimsher (1838\u20131890), were both mixed-race with Cherokee ancestry, and considered themselves Cherokee. Rogers quipped that his ancestors did not come over on the Mayflower, but they \"met the boat\". His mother was one quarter-Cherokee and born into the Paint Clan. \nUnlike his father Clement's people, Mary\u2019s Cherokee relatives had been expelled from Georgia under the Indian Removal Act of 1830 in an exodus known as The Trail of Tears. Of the 16,000 Cherokees driven to Indian Territory (later Oklahoma), 4,000 perished en route. She died of amoebic dysentery when Will was 10 years of age. His father remarried almost three years after her death.\nRogers was the youngest of eight children. He was named for the Cherokee leader Colonel William Penn Adair. Only three of his siblings, sisters Sallie Clementine, Maude Ethel, and Mary (May), survived into adulthood.\nHis mother, Mary Schrimsher, was a sister of Martha Schrimsher Gulager, the paternal grandmother of Clu Gulager, making Rogers and Gulager first cousins, once removed.\nHis father, Clement, was a leader in the Cherokee Nation. An attorney and Cherokee judge, Clement owned two slaves he had acquired from his father, and was a Confederate combat veteran of the American Civil War. He was promoted to regimental captain under Confederate colonel (later Brigadier General) Stand Watie and fought at the Battle of Pea Ridge (1862).\nClement served as a delegate to the Oklahoma Constitutional Convention. Rogers County, Oklahoma, is named in honor of him. He served several terms in the Cherokee Senate.\nRoach (1980) presents a sociological-psychological assessment of the relationship between Will and his father during the formative boyhood and teenage years. Clement had high expectations for his son and wanted him to be more responsible and business-minded. Will was more easygoing and oriented toward the loving affection offered by his mother, Mary, rather than the harshness of his father. The personality clash increased after his mother's death when the boy was ten. Young Will went from one venture to another with little success. Only after Will won acclaim in vaudeville did the rift begin to heal. Clement's death in 1911 precluded a full reconciliation.\nWill Rogers attended school in Indian Territory, at the Willie Halsell College at Vinita in 1895 and 1896, and then the Kemper Military School at Boonville over the 1897\u201398 school year. He was a good student and an avid reader of The New York Times, but he dropped out of school after the 10th grade. Rogers later said that he was a poor student, saying that he \"studied the Fourth Reader for ten years\". He was much more interested in cowboys and horses, and learned to rope and use a lariat.\n\nFirst jobs\nIn 1899, Rogers appeared in the St. Louis Fair as part of the Mulhall Rodeo. Near the end of 1901, when he was 22 years old, he and a friend, Dick Parris, left home hoping to work as gauchos in Argentina. They arrived in Argentina in May 1902, and spent five months trying to make it as ranch owners in the Pampas. Rogers and his partner lost all their money, and he later said, \"I was ashamed to send home for more.\" The two friends separated and Rogers sailed for South Africa. It is often claimed he took a job breaking in horses for the British Army, but the Boer War had ended three months earlier. Rogers was hired at James Piccione's ranch near Mooi River Station in the Pietermaritzburg district of Natal.\n\nCareer\nRogers began his show business career as a trick roper in \"Texas Jack's Wild West Circus\" in South Africa:\n\nHe [Texas Jack] had a little Wild West aggregation that visited the camps and did a tremendous business. I did some roping and riding, and Jack, who was one of the smartest showmen I ever knew, took a great interest in me. It was he who gave me the idea for my original stage act with my pony. I learned a lot about the show business from him. He could do a bum act with a rope that an ordinary man couldn't get away with, and make the audience think it was great, so I used to study him by the hour, and from him I learned the great secret of the show business\u2014knowing when to get off. It's the fellow who knows when to quit that the audience wants more of.\nGrateful for the guidance but anxious to move on, Rogers quit the circus and went to Australia. Texas Jack gave him a reference letter for the Wirth Brothers Circus there, and Rogers continued to perform as a rider and trick roper, and worked on his pony act. He returned to the United States in 1904, appeared at the Saint Louis World's Fair, and began to try his roping skills on the vaudeville circuits.\n\nVaudeville\nOn a trip to New York City, Rogers was at Madison Square Garden, on April 27, 1905, when a wild steer broke out of the arena and began to climb into the viewing stands. Rogers roped the steer to the delight of the crowd. The feat got front page attention from the newspapers, giving him valuable publicity and an audience eager to see more. Willie Hammerstein saw his vaudeville act, and signed Rogers to appear on the Victoria Roof\u2014which was literally on a rooftop\u2014with his pony. For the next decade, Rogers estimated he worked for 50 weeks a year at the Roof and at the city's myriad vaudeville theaters.\nRogers later recalled these early years:\n\nI got a job on Hammerstein's Roof at $140 a week for myself, my horse, and the man who looked after it. I remained on the roof for eight weeks, always getting another two-week extension when Willie Hammerstein would say to me after the Monday matinee, 'you're good for two weeks more'... Marty Shea, the booking agent for the Columbia, came to me and asked if I wanted to play burlesque. They could use an extra attraction....I told him I would think about it, but 'Burlesque' sounded to me then as something funny.\" Shea and Sam A. Scribner, the general manager of the Columbia Amusement Company, approached Rogers a few days later. Shea told Scribner Rogers was getting $150 and would take $175. \"'What's he carrying?', Scribner asked Shea. 'Himself, a horse, and a man', answered Shea.\" Scribner replied, \"'Give him eight weeks at $250'\".\nIn the fall of 1915, Rogers began to appear in Florenz Ziegfeld's Midnight Frolic. The variety revue began at midnight in the top-floor night club of Ziegfeld's New Amsterdam Theatre, and drew many influential\u2014and regular\u2014customers. By this time, Rogers had refined his act. His monologues on the news of the day followed a similar routine every night. He appeared on stage in his cowboy outfit, nonchalantly twirling his lasso, and said, \"Well, what shall I talk about? I ain't got anything funny to say. All I know is what I read in the papers.\" He would make jokes about what he had read in that day's newspapers. The line \"All I know is what I read in the papers\" is often incorrectly described as Rogers's most famous punch line, when it was his opening line.\nHis run at the New Amsterdam ran into 1916, and Rogers's growing popularity led to an engagement on the more famous Ziegfeld Follies. At this stage, Rogers's act was strictly physical, a silent display of daring riding and clever tricks with his lariat. He discovered that audiences identified the cowboy as the archetypical American\u2014doubtless aided by Theodore Roosevelt's image as a cowboy. Rogers's cowboy was an unfettered man free of institutional restraints, with no bureaucrats to order his life. When he came back to the United States and worked in Wild West shows, he slowly began adding the occasional spoken ad lib, such as \"Swingin' a rope's all right... if your neck ain't in it.\" Audiences responded to his laconic but pointed humor, and were just as fascinated by his frontier Oklahoma twang. By 1916, Rogers was a featured star in Ziegfeld's Follies on Broadway, as he moved into satire by transforming the \"Ropin' Fool\" to the \"Talkin' Fool\". At one performance, with President Woodrow Wilson in the audience, Rogers improvised a \"roast\" of presidential policies that had Wilson, and the entire audience, in stitches and proved his remarkable skill at off-the-cuff, witty commentary on current events. He built the rest of his career around that skill.\nA 1922 editorial in The New York Times said that \"Will Rogers in the Follies is carrying on the tradition of Aristophanes, and not unworthily.\" Rogers branched into silent films too, for Samuel Goldwyn's company Goldwyn Pictures. He made his first silent movie, Laughing Bill Hyde (1918), which was filmed in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Many early films were filmed and produced in the New York area in those years. Rogers could make a film, yet easily still rehearse and perform in the Follies. He eventually appeared in most of the Follies, from 1916 to 1925.\n\nFilms\nHollywood discovered Rogers in 1918, as Samuel Goldwyn gave him the title role in Laughing Bill Hyde.\nA three-year contract with Goldwyn, at triple the Broadway salary, moved Rogers west. He bought a ranch in the Pacific Palisades and set up his own production company. While Rogers enjoyed film acting, his appearances in silent movies suffered from the obvious restrictions of silence, as he had gained his fame as a commentator on stage. He wrote many of the title cards appearing in his films. In 1923, he began a one-year stint for Hal Roach and made 12 pictures. Among the films he made for Roach in 1924 were three directed by Rob Wagner: Two Wagons Both Covered, Going to Congress, and Our Congressman. He made two other feature silents and a travelogue series in 1927. After that, he did not return to the screen until beginning work in the 'talkies' in 1929.\nRogers made 48 silent movies, but with the arrival of sound in 1929, he became a top star in that medium. His first sound film, They Had to See Paris (1929), gave him the chance to exercise his verbal wit.\nHe played a homespun farmer (State Fair) in 1933, an old-fashioned doctor (Dr. Bull) in 1933, a small town banker (David Harum) in 1934, and a rustic politician (Judge Priest) in 1934. He was also in County Chairman (1935), Steamboat Round the Bend (1935), and In Old Kentucky (1935). His favorite director was John Ford.\nRogers appeared in 21 feature films alongside such noted performers as Lew Ayres, Billie Burke, Richard Cromwell, Jane Darwell, Andy Devine, Janet Gaynor, Rochelle Hudson, Boris Karloff, Myrna Loy, Joel McCrea, Hattie McDaniel, Ray Milland, Maureen O'Sullivan, ZaSu Pitts, Dick Powell, Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson, Mickey Rooney, and Peggy Wood. He was directed three times by John Ford. He appeared in four films with his friend Stepin Fetchit (aka Lincoln T. Perry): David Harum (1934), Judge Priest (1934), Steamboat Round the Bend (1935) and The County Chairman (1935).\nWith his voice becoming increasingly familiar to audiences, Rogers essentially played himself in each film, without film makeup, managing to ad-lib and sometimes work in his familiar commentaries on politics. The clean moral tone of his films resulted in various public schools taking their classes to attend special showings during the school day. His most unusual role may have been in the first talking version of Mark Twain's novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. His popularity soared to new heights with films including Young As You Feel, Judge Priest, and Life Begins at 40, with Richard Cromwell and Rochelle Hudson.\n\nNewspapers and magazines\nRogers was an indefatigable worker. He toured the lecture circuit. The New York Times syndicated his weekly newspaper column from 1922 to 1935. Going daily in 1926, his short column \"Will Rogers Says\" reached 40 million newspaper readers. He also wrote frequently for the mass-circulation upscale magazine The Saturday Evening Post. Rogers advised Americans to embrace the frontier values of neighborliness and democracy on the domestic front, while remaining clear of foreign entanglements. He took a strong, highly popular stand in favor of aviation, including a military air force of the sort his flying buddy General Billy Mitchell advocated.\nRogers began a weekly column, titled \"Slipping the Lariat Over\", at the end of 1922. He had already published a book of wisecracks and had begun a steady stream of humor books. Through the columns for the McNaught Syndicate between 1922 and 1935, as well as his personal appearances and radio broadcasts, he won the loving admiration of the American people, poking jibes in witty ways at the issues of the day and prominent people\u2014often politicians. He wrote from a nonpartisan point of view and became a friend of presidents and a confidant of the great. Loved for his cool mind and warm heart, he was often considered the successor to such greats as Artemus Ward and Mark Twain. Rogers was not the first entertainer to use political humor before his audience. Others, such as Broadway comedian Raymond Hitchcock and Britain's Sir Harry Lauder, preceded him by several years. Bob Hope is the best known political humorist to follow Rogers's example.\n\nRadio\nRadio was the exciting new medium, and Rogers became a star there as well, broadcasting his newspaper pieces. From 1929 to 1935, he made radio broadcasts for the Gulf Oil Company. This weekly Sunday evening show, The Gulf Headliners, ranked among the top radio programs in the country. Since Rogers easily rambled from one subject to another, reacting to his studio audience, he often lost track of the half-hour time limit in his earliest broadcasts, and was cut off in mid-sentence. To correct this, he brought in a wind-up alarm clock, and its on-air buzzing alerted him to begin wrapping up his comments. By 1935, his show was being announced as \"Will Rogers and his Famous Alarm Clock\".\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1908, Rogers married Betty Blake (1879\u20131944), and the couple had four children: Will Rogers Jr., Mary Amelia, James Blake, and Fred Stone. Will Jr. became a World War II hero, played his father in two films, and was elected to Congress. Mary became a Broadway actress, and James \"Jim\" was a newspaperman and rancher; Fred died of diphtheria at age two. The family lived in New York, but they spent summers in Oklahoma. In 1911, Rogers bought a 20-acre (8.1 ha) ranch near Claremore, Oklahoma, which he intended to use as his retirement home. He paid US$500 an acre, equal to $16,350 per acre today.\nFrom about 1925 to 1928, Rogers traveled the length and breadth of the United States in a \"lecture tour\". (He began his lectures by pointing out that \"A humorist entertains, and a lecturer annoys.\") During this time he became the first civilian to fly from coast to coast with pilots flying the mail in early air mail flights. The National Press Club dubbed him \"Ambassador at Large of the United States\". He visited Mexico City, along with Charles Lindbergh, as a guest of U.S. Ambassador Dwight Morrow. Rogers gave numerous after-dinner speeches, became a popular convention speaker, and gave dozens of benefits for victims of floods, droughts, or earthquakes.\nRogers traveled to Asia to perform in 1931, and to Central and South America the following year. In 1934, he made a globe-girdling tour and returned to play the lead in Eugene O'Neill's stage play Ah, Wilderness!. He had tentatively agreed to go on loan from Fox to MGM to star in the 1935 movie version of the play. But, concerned about a fan's reaction to the \"facts-of-life\" talk between his character and the latter's son, he declined the role. He and Wiley Post made plans to fly to Alaska that summer.\n\nPolitics\nRogers was a Democrat but has historically been known as apolitical. He was friends with every president starting with Theodore Roosevelt, and he notably supported Republican Calvin Coolidge over John W. Davis in 1924. During the Republican Convention of 1928, while criticizing the party platform, Rogers welcomed the nomination of Kaw citizen Charles Curtis as vice president, although he felt the leadership had deliberately kept him from the presidency: \"The Republican Party owed him something, but I didn't think they would be so low down as to pay him that way.\" Four years later, when the Republican leadership attempted to remove the more conservative Curtis from the Hoover ticket, Rogers defended him, and took credit for keeping him on the ticket: \"I saved my 'Injun' Charley Curtis for vice presidency. The rascals was just ready to stab him when we caught 'em.\"\nIn 1932 Rogers supported Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was his favorite president and politician. Although he supported Roosevelt's New Deal, he could just as easily joke about it: \"Lord, the money we do spend on Government and it's not one bit better than the government we got for one-third the money twenty years ago.\"\nRogers served as a goodwill ambassador to Mexico, and had a brief stint as mayor of Beverly Hills, a largely ceremonial position that allowed Rogers to joke about do-nothing politicians such as himself. During the depths of the Great Depression, angered by Washington's inability to feed the people, he embarked on a cross-country fundraising tour for the Red Cross.\n\n1928 presidential campaign\nRogers thought all campaigning was bunk. To prove the point, he mounted a mock campaign in 1928 for the presidency. His only vehicle was the pages of Life, a weekly humor magazine. The campaign was in large part an effort to boost circulation for the struggling magazine. Rogers ran as the \"bunkless candidate\" of the Anti-Bunk Party. His campaign promise was that, if elected, he would resign. Every week, from Memorial Day through Election Day, Rogers caricatured the farcical humors of grave campaign politics. On election day he declared victory and resigned (he did not actually receive any state electoral votes).\n\nAsked what issues would motivate voters? Prohibition: \"What's on your hip is bound to be on your mind\" (July 26).\nAsked if there should be presidential debates? Yes: \"Joint debate\u2014in any joint you name\" (August 9).\nHow about appeals to the common man? Easy: \"You can't make any commoner appeal than I can\" (August 16).\nWhat does the farmer need? Obvious: \"He needs a punch in the jaw if he believes that either of the parties cares a damn about him after the election\" (August 23).\nCan voters be fooled? Darn tootin': \"Of all the bunk handed out during a campaign the biggest one of all is to try and compliment the knowledge of the voter\" (September 21).\nWhat about a candidate's image? Ballyhoo: \"I hope there is some sane people who will appreciate dignity and not showmanship in their choice for the presidency\" (October 5).\n\nWhat of ugly campaign rumors? Don't worry: \"The things they whisper aren't as bad as what they say out loud\" (October 12).\n\nPhilosophy and style\nAfter Rogers gained recognition as a humorist-philosopher in vaudeville, he gained a national audience in acting and literary careers from 1915 to 1935. In these years, Rogers increasingly expressed the views of the \"common man\" in America. He downplayed academic credentials, noting, \"Everybody is ignorant, only on different subjects.\" Americans of all walks admired his individualism, his appreciation for democratic ideas, and his liberal philosophies on most issues. Moreover, Rogers extolled hard work in order to succeed, and such expressions affirmed American theories about how to realize individual success. Rogers symbolized the self-made man, the common man, who believed in America, in progress, and in the American Dream of upward mobility. His humor never offended even those who were the targets of it.\nIn the 1920s, the United States was happy and prosperous in various ways (leading to the nickname Roaring Twenties), but it also suffered from rapid change and social tensions. Some people were disenchanted by, and alienated from, the outside world. Many common people believed that World War I had resulted in extensive and largely senseless carnage, and they supported isolationism for the US. According to scholar Peter Rollins (1976), Rogers appeared to be an anchor of stability; his conventional home life and traditional moral code reminded people of a recent past. His newspaper column, which ran from 1922 to 1935, expressed his traditional morality and his belief that political problems were not as serious as they sounded. In his films, Rogers began by playing a simple cowboy; his characters evolved to explore the meaning of innocence in ordinary life. In his last movies, Rogers explores a society fracturing into competing classes from economic pressures. Throughout his career, Rogers was a link to a better, more comprehensible past.\nIn 1926, the high-circulation weekly magazine The Saturday Evening Post financed a European tour for Rogers, in return for publication of his articles. Rogers made whirlwind visits to numerous European capitals and met with both international figures and common people. His articles reflected a fear that Europeans would go to war again. He recommended isolationism for the United States. He reasoned that for the moment, American needs could best be served by concentrating on domestic questions and avoiding foreign entanglements. He commented:\n\nAmerica has a unique record. We never lost a war and we never won a conference in our lives. I believe that we could without any degree of egotism, single-handed lick any nation in the world. But we can't confer with Costa Rica and come home with our shirts on.\nRogers was famous for his use of language. He effectively used up-to-date slang and invented new words to fit his needs. He also made frequent use of puns and terms which closely linked him to the cowboy tradition, as well as speech patterns using a southern dialect.\nBrown (1979) argues that Rogers held up a \"magic mirror\" that reflected iconic American values. Rogers was the archetypical \"American Democrat\" thanks to his knack of moving freely among all social classes, his stance above political parties, and his passion for fair play. He represented the \"American Adam\" with his independence and self-made record. Rogers furthermore represented the \"American Prometheus\" through his commitment to utilitarian methods and his ever-optimistic faith in future progress.\n\nAviation and death\nWill Rogers became an advocate for the aviation industry after noticing advancements in Europe and befriending Charles Lindbergh, the most famous American aviator of the era. During his 1926 European trip, Rogers witnessed the European advances in commercial air service and compared them to the almost nonexistent facilities in the United States. Rogers' newspaper columns frequently emphasized the safety record, speed, and convenience of this means of transportation, and he helped shape public opinion on the subject.\nIn 1935, the famed aviator Wiley Post, an Oklahoman, became interested in surveying a mail-and-passenger air route from the West Coast to Russia. He attached a Lockheed Explorer wing to a Lockheed Orion fuselage, fitting floats for landing in the lakes of Alaska and Siberia. Rogers visited Post often at the airport in Burbank, California, while he was modifying the aircraft. He asked Post to fly him through Alaska in search of new material for his newspaper column.\nAfter making a test flight in July, Post and Rogers left Lake Washington in Renton, Washington in the Lockheed Orion-Explorer in early August and then made several stops in Alaska. While Post piloted the aircraft, Rogers wrote his columns on his typewriter. Before they left Fairbanks, they signed and mailed a burgee, a distinguishing flag belonging to the South Coast Corinthian Yacht Club. The signed burgee is on display at South Coast Corinthian Yacht Club in Marina del Rey, California. On August 15, they left Fairbanks for Point Barrow.\nAbout 20 miles southwest of Point Barrow, having difficulty figuring their position due to bad weather, they landed in a lagoon to ask directions. On takeoff, the engine failed at low altitude, and the aircraft plunged into the lagoon, shearing off the right wing, and ended up inverted in the shallow water of the lagoon. Both men died instantly. Rogers was buried August 21, 1935, in Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California; it was a temporary interment. He was re-interred at the Will Rogers Memorial in Claremore, Oklahoma in 1944.\nExperts have studied the accident and still disagree about its cause. Bobby H. Johnson and R. Stanley Mohler argued in a 1971 article that Post had ordered floats that did not reach Seattle in time for the planned trip. He used a set that was designed for a larger type of plane, making the already nose-heavy hybrid aircraft even more nose-heavy. But Bryan and Frances Sterling maintain in their 2001 book Forgotten Eagle: Wiley Post: America's Heroic Aviation Pioneer that their research showed the floats were the correct type for the aircraft, thereby suggesting another cause for the crash.\n\nLegacy\nIn 1962, the town of Higgins, Texas (near a ranch where Rogers had worked in 1922), began an annual observance of Will Rogers Day, in honor of the cowboy philosopher, who remained a close friend of Frank Ewing, the son of his old employer.\nRogers was posthumously inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nOklahoma honors\nBefore his death, the state of Oklahoma commissioned a statue of Rogers, to be displayed as one of the two it has in the National Statuary Hall Collection of the United States Capitol. Rogers agreed on the condition that his image would be placed facing the House Chamber, supposedly so he could \"keep an eye on Congress\". Of the statues in this part of the Capitol, the Rogers sculpture is the only one facing the Chamber entrance\u2014a stakeout location for camera crews looking to catch House members during and after voting. It is also a common background for reporters and lawmakers, with staff often directing the media to be at the \"Will Rogers stakeout\" at a certain time. According to some Capitol guides, each U.S. president rubs the left shoe of the Rogers statue for good luck before entering the House Chamber to give the State of the Union address.\nA state appropriation paid for the work. It was sculpted in clay by Jo Davidson. He had been a close friend of Rogers. Davidson had the work cast in bronze in Brussels, Belgium. It was dedicated on June 6, 1939, before a crowd of more than 2,000 people. The Architect of the Capitol, David Lynn, said there had never been such a large ceremony or crowd in the Capitol.\nHis birthplace at the Dog Iron Ranch is located two miles east of Oologah, Oklahoma. When the Verdigris River valley was flooded to create Oologah Lake as part of a major dam project, the Rogers house was preserved by moving it about 3\u20444 mile (1.2 km) to its present location overlooking the original site.\nThe family tomb is at the Will Rogers Memorial Museum, constructed in nearby Claremore on the site purchased by Rogers in 1911 for his retirement home. On May 19, 1944, Rogers's body was moved from a holding vault in Glendale, California, to the tomb. After his wife Betty died later that year, she was also interred there. A casting of the Davidson sculpture that stands in National Statuary Hall, paid for by Davidson, was installed at the museum. Both the birthplace and the museum are open to the public.\n\nMany landmarks were named in Rogers' honor: Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City, where a recent expansion and renovation included the installation of a statue of Rogers on horseback in front of the terminal. The Will Rogers Turnpike is the section of Interstate 44 between Tulsa and Joplin, Missouri. Near Vinita, Oklahoma, a statue of Rogers was installed at the service plaza that spans the interstate.\nThirteen public schools in Oklahoma have been named for Rogers, including Will Rogers High School in Tulsa. The University of Oklahoma named the large Will Rogers Room in the student union for him. The Boy Scouts of America honored him with the Will Rogers Council and the Will Rogers Scout Reservation near Cleveland.\nIn 1947, a college football bowl game was named in his honor, but the event folded after the first year.\nThe Academy of Western Artists, based in Gene Autry, Oklahoma, presents an annual Will Rogers Medallion award for excellence in western literature.\n\nColorado memorial\nThe Will Rogers Shrine of the Sun is an 80-foot observation tower on Cheyenne Mountain west of Colorado Springs, at the base of Pikes Peak near the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo.\n\nCalifornia memorials\nRogers's California home, stables, and polo fields are preserved today for public enjoyment as Will Rogers State Historic Park in Pacific Palisades. His widow, Betty, willed the property to the state of California upon her death in 1944, under the condition that polo be played on the field every year; it is home to the Will Rogers Polo Club.\n\nSeveral schools have been named for him: Will Rogers Elementary School in Santa Monica, Will Rogers Elementary School in Ventura, middle schools in Long Beach and in Fair Oaks.\nWill Rogers Memorial Park, a small park at Sunset Boulevard and Beverly Drive in Beverly Hills, was named after him, as is Will Rogers State Beach in Pacific Palisades.\nU.S. Route 66 is known as the Will Rogers Highway; a plaque dedicating the highway to the humorist is located at the western terminus of Route 66 in Santa Monica.\nThe California Theatre in San Bernardino is the site of the humorist's final show. He always performed in front of a special jewelled curtain and had two of them. While he was using one, he would send the other to the site of his next performance. The curtain used in his final show was retained by the California Theatre. Two memorial murals by Kent Twitchell were installed on the exterior of the fly loft. The California Theatre named one of its reception spaces the Will Rogers Room.\n\nTexas memorials\nThe Will Rogers Memorial Center was built in Fort Worth, Texas, in 1936. It includes a mural, a bust and a life-size statue of Will Rogers on Soapsuds, titled Riding into the Sunset, sculpted by Electra Waggoner Biggs.\n\nA casting of Riding into the Sunset stands at the entrance to the main campus quad at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas. This memorial was dedicated on February 16, 1950, by Rogers' longtime friend, Amon G. Carter. Another casting is held at the Will Rogers Memorial in Claremore, and a casting is located at the entrance of the Hilton Anatole in Dallas.\n\nWashington State and Alaska memorials\nBefore heading up to Alaska, Rogers played polo at a field in Seattle. This was his \"last ride\" on a horse, so a monument was erected next to the field in 1938. A small monument at the Renton airport commemorates the starting point of the fatal 1935 Post-Rogers flight. A memorial is also located within the city of Utqiagvik (formerly Barrow), Alaska.\n\nNational tributes\nIn 1936, the NVA Hospital located in Saranac Lake, New York was renamed as the Will Rogers Memorial Hospital by the National Vaudeville Artists association.\nOn November 4, 1948, the United States Post Office commemorated Rogers with a three-cent postage stamp. In 1979, it issued a United States Postal Service 15-cent stamp of him as part of the \"Performing Arts\" series.\nIn 1976, Rogers was among the historical figures depicted in the artwork Our Nation's 200th Birthday, The Telephone's 100th Birthday by Stanley Meltzoff for Bell System.\nThe airport for Utqiagvik (formerly Barrow), Alaska (BRW), located about 16 miles (26 km) from the location of the fatal airplane crash, is known as the Wiley Post\u2013Will Rogers Memorial Airport.\nThe Rogers-Post Site, overlooking the lagoon where the plane crashed, has two (or possibly one remaining) monuments. It is on the National Register of Historic Places. A plaque to Rogers and Post was also erected in Barrow.\nThe World War II Liberty Ship SS Will Rogers was named in his honor.\nThe final ship of the Benjamin Franklin-class submarines, USS Will Rogers (SSBN-659), was launched in 1966, and commissioned the following year.\nOn November 4, 2019, Google celebrated his 140th birthday with a Google Doodle.\n\nFilm and stage portrayals\nRogers was portrayed by A.A. Trimble in cameos in both the 1936 film The Great Ziegfeld, and the 1937 film You're a Sweetheart.\nRogers was portrayed by his son, Will Rogers Jr., in a cameo in the 1949 film Look for the Silver Lining, as the star of the 1952 film The Story of Will Rogers, and as a voice-only cameo in The American Adventure at Epcot.\nJames Whitmore portrayed Rogers in eight runs of the one-man play Will Rogers' USA between 1970 and 2000, including a limited run on Broadway in 1974, and as a television film in 1972. Whitmore changed the monologue each time he performed it, using quotations from Rogers as commentary on events current at the time of the performance.\nThe Tony Award-winning musical The Will Rogers Follies, produced on Broadway in 1991, starred Keith Carradine in the lead role. Carradine also played Rogers in the 1994 film Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle.\n\nFilmography\nSilent films\nSound films\nReferences and further reading\nBiographies\nCarnes, Mark C.

One of the principal east\u2013west arterial roads of Los Angeles, it is also one of the major city streets through the city of Beverly Hills. Wilshire Boulevard runs roughly parallel to Santa Monica Boulevard from Santa Monica to the west boundary of Beverly Hills. From the east boundary, it runs a block south of Sixth Street to its terminus.\n\n \n\nWilshire Boulevard is densely developed throughout most of its span, connecting five of Los Angeles's major business districts and Beverly Hills. Many of the post-1956 skyscrapers in Los Angeles are located along Wilshire; for example, the Wilshire Grand Center, the tallest building in California, sits at the intersection of Figueroa Street. One Wilshire, built in 1966 at the junction of Wilshire and Grand, is said to be \"the main hub of the internet for the entire Pacific Rim\" because so many telecommunications companies rent space there. Aon Center, Los Angeles' third-largest tower, is at 707 Wilshire Boulevard in downtown Los Angeles.\nThe stretch of the boulevard between Fairfax and Highland Avenues, known as the Miracle Mile, is home to many of Los Angeles's largest museums and cultural institutions. The area just to the east, between Highland Avenue and Wilton Place, is referred to as the Park Mile. Between Westwood and Holmby Hills, several tall glitzy condominium buildings overlook this part of Wilshire, which is variously referred to as Millionaire's Mile, the Wilshire Corridor, and Condo Canyon.\nThe Wilshire Corridor, located next to Century City, is one of Los Angeles's busiest districts, and contains many high-rise residential towers. The Fox and MGM studios are located in a series of skyscrapers, along with many historic Los Angeles hotels.\nWilshire Boulevard is also the principal street of Koreatown, the site of many of Los Angeles' oldest buildings and skyscrapers. Koreatown and Mid-Wilshire are among Los Angeles's most densely populated districts.\n\nHistory\nThe Calle de los Indios\nWilshire Boulevard originated as one of the central pathways constructed by the Tongva tribes residing in the region prior to the exploration of the conquistadores.  At the time of the founding of Los Angeles, Wilshire Boulevard was one of the main arteries connecting the largest Tongva village in the area, then known as Yaanga, which eventually become Union Station, to the Pacific Ocean.  \nFrom the founding of Los Angeles through nearly all of the 1800s, Wilshire Boulevard was known as \"Calle de los Indios.\"\nBefore the Spanish settlements of Los Angeles, much of the length of Wilshire Boulevard can be traced back to the indigenous Tongva people who used it to bring back tar from the La Brea pits in today's Miracle Mile section of Wilshire Blvd, back to their settlement on the coast. This road was later used by Spanish explorers and settlers, calling it El Camino Viejo ('The Old Road'). The route that ultimately became Wilshire crossed the original pueblo of Los Angeles and five of the original Spanish land grants, or ranchos.\nWilshire was pieced together from various streets over several decades. It began in the 1870s as Nevada Avenue in Santa Monica, and in the 1880s as Orange Street between Westlake (now MacArthur) Park and downtown. Nevada and Orange were later renamed as parts of Wilshire.\n\nAs Wilshire Boulevard\nIn 1895, Henry Gaylord Wilshire (1861\u20131927), a developer, publisher, and revolutionary who made and lost fortunes in real estate, farming, and gold mining, donated land to the City of Los Angeles for a boulevard stretching westward from a tract of luxury homes he was developing in Westlake Park (today's MacArthur Park).  His conditions for the donation of the 120 ft (37 m) wide by 1,200 ft (370 m) long strip of land along the 35 acres (14 ha) barley field he was subdividing were  that it be named for him and that railroad lines and commercial or industrial trucking would be banned. The road first appeared on a map under its present name in 1895. A historic apartment building on the corner of Wilshire Boulevard and South Kenmore Avenue, the Gaylord, carries his middle name.\nWilshire Boulevard formerly ended at the MacArthur Park lake, but in 1934 a berm was built for it to cross and link up with the existing Orange Street (which ran from Figueroa to Alvarado) into downtown Los Angeles. Orange Street was renamed Wilshire and extended east of Figueroa to Grand. This divided the lake into two halves; the northern half was later drained.\nThe Wilshire Boulevard home of J. Paul Getty was used as the film set for the 1950 film Sunset Boulevard: it was demolished in 1957.\n\nTransportation\nAll of the boulevard is at least four lanes in width, and most of the portion between Hoover Street and Robertson Boulevard has a raised center median. The widest portion of the boulevard is located in the business district of central Westwood, where mobs of pedestrians crossing Wilshire at Westwood Boulevard must traverse ten lanes (including two left-turn pockets). According to a 1991 study by the Los Angeles Department of Transportation, this and the nearby intersection of Wilshire and Veteran are among the busiest in Los Angeles.\n\nLA Metro Rail\nThe B and D subway lines of the Los Angeles Metro Rail run along Wilshire Boulevard from just past the 7th Street\/Metro Center before serving the Westlake\/\u200bMacArthur Park and Wilshire\/Vermont stations, where the D Line continues along Wilshire Boulevardto serve two stations at Wilshire\/Normandie and at Wilshire\/Western in Koreatown, while the B Line branches off north along Vermont Avenue to eventually terminate in North Hollywood.\nThe construction of the future D Line Extension along Wilshire Boulevard commenced in November 2014. The construction timeline would see the project from the existing Wilshire\/Western station to the planned Wilshire\/La Cienega station on the corner of Wilshire and La Cienega Boulevard, to be completed by 2025. The second phase got officially under way on February 23, 2018 from Wilshire\/La Cienega to Century City Station, and it is expected to be completed in 2026. Phase 3 of the D Line extension, when fully completed, will extend to UCLA and Westwood\/VA Hospital, and will follow Wilshire Boulevard for most of its route. That part will be completed in 2027 in time for the 2028 Summer Olympics held in Los Angeles, as the Westwood\/UCLA station will serve multiple sporting venues. Phase four to downtown Santa Monica is still in the planning stages and has no funding.\n\nLA Metro bus routes\nMetro Local Line 20, Metro Rapid Line 720, and Santa Monica Transit Line 2 operate along Wilshire Boulevard. Due to the high ridership of line 720, 60-foot (18 m) NABI & New Flyer articulated buses are used on this route, and bus lanes are in place along some segments of the line.\nThe aging sections of Wilshire Boulevard in the city of Los Angeles are notorious for their giant potholes.\n\nCommunities from west to east\nWilshire Boulevard runs through or near the following communities:\n\nSanta Monica (city)\nBrentwood (neighborhood)\nSawtelle (neighborhood)\nWestwood (neighborhood)\nBeverly Hills (city)\nMiracle Mile (historic stretch of the boulevard)\nCarthay Circle (neighborhood) \u2013 boulevard flanks northern edge\nHancock Park (neighborhood) \u2013 boulevard flanks southern edge\nWindsor Square (neighborhood) \u2013 boulevard flanks southern edge\nWilshire Park (neighborhood)\nWilshire Center (neighborhood) \/ Koreatown (neighborhood)\nWestlake (neighborhood)\nDowntown Los Angeles\n\nLandmarks from west to east\nSanta Monica sculpture\nLos Angeles National Cemetery\nWilshire Federal Building\nHammer Museum\nWestwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery\nSephardic Temple Tifereth Israel\nWilshire Regent\nSinai Temple\nLos Angeles Country Club\nBeverly Hilton Hotel\nThe Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel\nRodeo Drive\nSterling Plaza\nAcademy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\nLarry Flynt Publications\nSaban Theatre (formerly Fox Wilshire Theater)\nJohnie's Coffee Shop\nPetersen Automotive Museum\nAcademy Museum of Motion Pictures\nHancock Park\nLos Angeles County Museum of Art\nLa Brea Tar Pits and George C.
