members. By March 1958, the program was carried on 158 stations in the United States. The program was also broadcast on ATN-7 in Australia and on ZBM-TV in Bermuda.\n\nSynopsis and background\nThe series is set in the Arizona Territory in the first decade of the 20th century. The rangers were part of the group established by the Arizona Territorial Legislature in 1901. The number of members was limited to 26 \"to avoid vigilantism\". Information from government archives and newspapers provided the basis of the plots of episodes.\n\nCritical response\nA review in the trade publication Variety said that the premiere episode had \"clean action and plot situations\", making it different from the era's trend toward adult westerns. It commended the work of Tris Coffin and Kelo Henderson and the pacing of the direction but noted that production values appeared weaker than those of Western programs on networks.\n\nCast\nMain\nTris Coffin as Captain Thomas H. Rynning\nKelo Henderson as ranger Clint Travis.\n\nGuest stars\nEpisodes\nSeries overview\nSeason 1 (1957\u201358)\nSeason 2 (1958\u201359)\nProduction\nRussell Hayden was the producer of the ABC Film Syndication series. Reg Browne was the director, Sloane Nibley was the writer, and Oliver Drake was the adapter. The theme song was written by Hal Hopper.\nFacilities of Cudia City Studios, in Phoenix, Arizona, were expanded to handle filming of 26 Men. When the series filmed on location, local residents often filled some roles in the cast. It was \"reportedly the first TV series ever to be filmed completely in Arizona.\"\n\nSponsors\nAs a syndicated program, 26 Men had different sponsors in different parts of the United States. They included H. P. Hood and Sons (a dairy) for all of New England; Mrs. Smith's Pie Company and Freihofer Baking Company (alternating weekly) in four cities in Pennsylvania; Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company in Pittsburgh, Syracuse, and Buffalo; and Standard Oil of Texas in eight markets in Texas and New Mexico.\n\nRelease\nHome media\nTimeless Media Group released a 3-disc best-of set, featuring 20 episodes from the series on DVD in Region 1 on April 12, 2011.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n26 Men at IMDb","2":"The men's national basketball team of the United States competed at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, France, and won the gold medal. They qualified for the Olympics as one of the top two FIBA Basketball World Cup finishers from the Americas in 2023. It was the fifth consecutive Olympic gold medal for the Americans, who defeated France in the gold-medal game for the second straight Olympics.\nThe U.S. team had been given the nickname \"the Avengers\" by some media outlets due to their high profile roster, which was assembled after their 2023 World Cup squad failed to medal. The Olympic squad included four National Basketball Association (NBA) players who have won its league most valuable player (MVP) award\u2014LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry and Joel Embiid\u2014an Olympic first. After the conclusion of the tournament, James was named the FIBA Men's Olympics MVP and was selected to the FIBA Men's Olympics All-Star Five along with Curry.\n\nTimeline\nJanuary 23, 2024 41 roster finalists announced\nApril 17 Initial 12-man roster named\nJuly 5 Start of training camp\nJuly 10\u201322 Exhibition games\nJuly 28 \u2013 August 11 2024 Summer Olympics\n\nRoster\nAfter the 2023 U.S. World Cup team finished in fourth place, the first time since 1970 that Team USA failed to medal in consecutive World Cups, USA Basketball executive director Grant Hill and head coach Steve Kerr tried to persuade more experienced players to join the Olympic team. The NBA career scoring leader, LeBron James, reportedly committed the day after the United States lost in the World Cup bronze medal game, and he recruited other players to join the team. Kevin Durant, who was already the career leading scorer in U.S. men's Olympic history, said that he \"kind of committed\" to the Olympic team during the 2022\u201323 NBA season, when he was with the Brooklyn Nets, and Hill and Kerr were in Brooklyn to convince him to play in the World Cup. According to Durant, after James \"started texting everybody ... I kind of knew we were all going to get together and that this was a special time\". Stephen Curry, the NBA's all-time 3-point scoring leader, said he \"pretty much softly committed\" in 2022, when he and Kerr, his head coach with the Golden State Warriors, were returning from Boston after winning the NBA Finals over the Boston Celtics. Curry was joking with Kerr that the Olympics was \"the only thing I hadn't done\". In 2023, James texted Curry about playing. For four consecutive seasons from 2015 to 2018, while James was with the Cleveland Cavaliers, he and Curry faced each other in the NBA Finals, with the Warriors claiming three titles. Durant, who was Curry's teammate for two of those championships, said that joining the Olympic team \"was a no-brainer, especially when [James and Curry] committed.\"\nSeven players on the 2024 team had prior Olympic experience, a U.S. record. Durant, Bam Adebayo, Devin Booker, Jrue Holiday, and Jayson Tatum returned from the 2020 Olympic team that won gold, while James and Anthony Davis won gold in earlier Olympics. Anthony Edwards, the team's youngest player at 22, and Tyrese Haliburton were on the 2023 World Cup squad, while Curry won gold twice at the FIBA World Championships (previous name of the World Cup). The 2024 roster had won a combined 14 gold medals in major international events. It was the oldest U.S. men's basketball team, averaging 30 years and 9 months when the Games started, surpassing the 1996 team's average of 29 years, 10 months old. Hill said that he felt obliged to include James (age 39), Curry (36), and Durant (35) after they publicly committed to playing in the 2024 Olympics.\nThe American squad included 11 players who had been NBA All-Stars, three former NBA Finals MVPs and seven players who had won NBA championships. They had fewer role players than past U.S. Olympic squads as Hill instead focused on talent. He was concerned with the variation in talent among the Olympic opponents. Canada and South Sudan were deep in guards, while Germany and France were laden with big men. Joel Embiid, who had the opportunity to play for his native country Cameroon as well as France, was motivated to choose the United States because of his son, who was born an American in 2020. He also said that he had \"some concern\" with France and stated, \"Comfort level was huge. I always say I'm going to be where I'm wanted and these guys wanted me.\" Embiid's addition addressed the lack of size and defense on the 2023 World Cup team. However, he had missed over half of the 2023\u201324 NBA regular season and played with a knee injury in the playoffs.\nSix-time All-Star Kawhi Leonard had missed the final eight regular-season games for the Los Angeles Clippers and four of their six first-round playoff games with a right knee inflammation. On July 10, 2024, before Team USA's first exhibition, Leonard was replaced on the roster by the Celtics' Derrick White, who was coming off consecutive NBA All-Defensive Second Team selections and played on the 2019 World Cup team. According to Clippers president of basketball operations Lawrence Frank, Leonard wanted to stay with the squad, and the Clippers were supportive, but it was USA Basketball's decision. \"I really wish they would have given Kawhi more time\", said Frank. With Leonard, the United States team would have included 11 players who were All-Stars in 2024 as well as a combined 84 All-Star selections, the most ever in the Olympics. They also would have been the second Olympic team filled entirely with former All-Stars, joining the 1996 U.S. team. Three-time All-Star Jaylen Brown of the Celtics believed that he was passed over as Leonard's replacement in part due to Nike's influence. Brown had been critical of the company in the past, and White, Brown's Boston teammate, is a Nike-sponsored athlete.\n\nThe following were also candidates to make the team:\n\nExhibition games\nThe United States was 5\u20130 in exhibition games but did not look unbeatable. They won convincingly over Canada and Serbia; led Australia by 25 before the Aussies came back to make it close; and were at risk of losing the final two games against South Sudan and Germany, both in London, but LeBron James's late-game performances led Team USA to victories. He scored 13 of the team's 17 combined points in the final four minutes of both contests. According to head coach Steve Kerr, the U.S. was outplayed \"effort- and energy-wise\" in the two games, and he felt that they played slowly and did not use their depth to their advantage.\nKevin Durant did not play in any of the games after suffering a calf strain in a workout before training camp. After coming out of training camp slowly and appearing out of shape, Joel Embiid steadily improved with each outing.\n\nCanada\nThe United States won their exhibition opener 86\u201372 over Canada.  Anthony Edwards led all scorers with 13 points. The Americans began the game shooting 0 for 6, but overcame an early 11\u20131 deficit to lead 41\u201333 at halftime. They expanded their lead to 69\u201354 after three quarters. Team USA played without Durant and Derrick White, who had not joined the team yet after replacing Kawhi Leonard on the squad.\n\nAustralia\nAnthony Davis scored 17 points and had 14 rebounds in Team USA's 98\u201392 win over Australia. The Americans were up by 24 points in the third quarter, but the Australians pulled to within five points with 5:05 remaining in the game after outscoring the United States 39\u201321. Twice Australia cut the deficit to four points, but Devin Booker was a perfect four of four on free throws in the final eight seconds to secure the win.\nKerr started two new players\u2014Edwards and Jayson Tatum. The team committed 18 turnovers and allowed 13 offensive rebounds. White joined the team in Abu Dhabi and practiced, but did not play in the game.\n\nSerbia\nStephen Curry led the United States with 24 points in a 105\u201379 win over Serbia. He scored Team USA's first nine points and had 18 in the first half, making four three-point field goals in 11 minutes. The game was tied at 40 with 4:42 remaining in the second quarter, when Curry made a four-point play on a three-pointer and subsequent free throw. The Americans led 59\u201345 at the half, pulling away from the Serbs with a 31\u20135 run over the second and third quarters. Team USA led by 25 entering the fourth, before expanding its lead to 30.\nDavis had all six of the United States' blocks, and the team held six-time All-Star Nikola Joki\u0107, the reigning NBA MVP, to 6-of-19 shooting. Edwards added 16 points off the bench. In his U.S. debut, White finished with four rebounds and an assist in nine minutes. Serbia did not play captain Bogdan Bogdanovi\u0107.\n\nSouth Sudan\nLeBron James made a layup with eight seconds remaining in the game to put Team USA ahead, and they held on for a 101\u2013100 win over South Sudan. After going up 8\u20130 in the first 2+1\u20442 minutes of the game, the Americans trailed 58\u201344 at halftime after South Sudan made 61 percent of their shots in the first half and outscored the United States 21\u20133 on 3-pointers. Team USA rallied back with an 18\u20130 run in the second half, going up 79\u201376 late in the third quarter on a 35-foot (11 m) three-pointer from Curry for their first lead since the first quarter. South Sudan missed three attempts in the final seconds to win the game. The team's performance came as a surprise, as they entered the game as 43+1\u20442-point underdogs according to BetMGM Sportsbook.\nJames had a game-high 25 points along with six rebounds and seven assists, and Davis finished with 15 points and 10 rebounds. South Sudan's Marial Shayok had 24 points and Carlik Jones had a triple-double with 15 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists.\n\nGermany\nJames scored the final 11 points for the United States in the last 3:57 of the game as they fended off defending World Cup champion Germany 92\u201388. Team USA led 48\u201341 at the half, but they were outscored in the third quarter 30\u201320. Trailing entering the fourth quarter, the United States' defense held the Germans to 19 points and James took over on offense. The Germans shot just 36%, but took 13 more shots than the Americans, with 14 offensive rebounds leading to 16 points. Team USA also committed 14 turnovers to Germany's 7.\nJames scored a game-high 20 points and added six rebounds and four assists. Embiid continued his improved play with 15 points, eight rebounds and five assists, offsetting his backup, Davis, who got into foul trouble. Curry had 13 points but made just 1-of-7 on 3-pointers. Off the bench, Edwards added 11 points and Davis had 10 points and seven rebounds. White received all the backup playing time at point guard, as Kerr removed Tyrese Haliburton from the rotation. Franz Wagner, one of four active NBA players on Germany's roster, led his team with 18 points. Andreas Obst, the star of Germany's semifinals win over the United States in the 2023 World Cup, had 17 points and five 3s. Dennis Schr\u00f6der scored 13 points and had 10 assists while shooting 3-of-15.\n\nOlympic play\nThe United States went undefeated at 6\u20130, winning by an average of 19 points per game. LeBron James was named the Olympics MVP after averaging 14.2 points along with team highs of 6.8 rebounds and 8.5 assists per game, and he was named to the Olympics All-Star Five along with Stephen Curry. Curry edged James as the team scoring leader by four points, averaging 14.8 points per game. Leading up to the semifinals, Curry struggled, shooting 10 of 28 (35.7%) and 5 of 20 on 3-pointers (25%) in four games, averaging 7.3 points while scoring in single-digits three times. Over the final two games, he scored 60 points and made 17 of 26 on 3s. Overall, Curry led the team in plus\u2013minus at plus-86, while James was second at plus-84. U.S. head coach Steve Kerr lauded Devin Booker as the team's \"unsung MVP\".  Normally a high scorer in the NBA, he changed to a 3-and-D role on the Olympic team, serving as an on-ball, perimeter defender and a ball mover on offense. He made a team-high 56.5% (13 of 23) of his 3-pointers.\n\nPreliminary round\nThe Olympics featured 12 nations divided into three groups of four. Each team played three games, one game each against the other teams in their group. The first- and second-place teams advanced to the knockout stage, along with the top two third-place teams. The United States was placed in Group C alongside Serbia, South Sudan, and Puerto Rico with games in Lille. The Americans finished 3\u20130, joining Germany and Canada as the only undefeated teams in group play. Team USA earned the No. 1 seed in the quarterfinals with a plus-64 point differential, surpassing Germany's plus-47 for the highest.\nKerr used three different starting lineups in the preliminary round. He was scrutinized for starting Joel Embiid over Anthony Davis, bringing Kevin Durant off the bench, and removing Jayson Tatum from his rotation. A different player led the team in scoring in every game, each coming off the bench. The team shot 54% with ten players averaging seven or more points per game, each attempting an average of at least six shots per game, but none attempting over ten.\n\nAll times are local (UTC+2).\n\nSerbia\nDurant scored a game-high 23 points on 8-of-9 shooting as the United States won their opener 110\u201384 over Serbia. After being out for a month with a calf injury, he was cleared to play less than an hour prior to the game. He made his first eight shots, including five 3-pointers. The Serbians went up 10\u20132 to start the game and were leading 19\u201314 when Durant entered the contest and made his first two jump shots, both 3-pointers. He scored 21 points in the first half, helping Team USA to a 58\u201349 halftime lead.\nJames had 21 points, seven rebounds and nine assists for the Americans. Embiid struggled with four points on 2-of-5 shooting and two rebounds in 11 minutes, finishing with a plus\u2013minus of minus-eight, the only American with a negative plus\u2013minus, while the United States was a plus-34 when he was off the floor. Kerr replaced him early with Davis, who had seven points, eight rebounds, and a team-high plus-28. Embiid and Davis both missed practice time leading up to the game due to illness. With Durant's return, Kerr chose not to play Tatum. Three-time NBA MVP Nikola Joki\u0107 had a team-high 20 points for Serbia along with five rebounds and eight assists. The teams both scored 81 points in the 30:45 minutes that he played, but Serbia was outscored 29\u20133 during his 9:15 on the bench.\n\nSouth Sudan\nBam Adebayo came off the bench and scored a team-high 18 points in a 103\u201386 win over South Sudan that clinched a spot in the quarterfinals. After nearly beating the United States in their exhibition game, the South Sudanese led 7\u20136 and 10\u20138 before the Americans outscored them 25\u20134 for a 33\u201314 lead and 55\u201336 edge at halftime. After South Sudan pulled to within 10 in the third quarter, Team USA entered the final period up 73\u201357. The U.S. reserves outscored South Sudan's 66\u201314.\nAfter sitting out the previous game against Serbia, Tatum entered the starting lineup, replacing his Boston teammate Jrue Holiday. Adebayo, who shot 8 for 10 and added seven rebounds, received extended playing time as Embiid did not play. Davis, who replaced Embiid in the starting lineup, had eight points, seven rebounds and two blocks. Kerr called South Sudan\u2014who made 14 three-pointers in their game in London against Team USA\u2014\"the fastest team\" they would face in the Olympics, and he wanted a \"smaller, quicker team\" to match up, which kept Embiid on the bench. With the United States using an 11-man rotation in the first half, Tyrese Haliburton made his first appearance in the Olympics. Durant came off the bench again and scored 14 points, one of six Americans in double figures. Nuni Omot led South Sudan with a game-high 24 points, while Carlik Jones added 18 points on 8-of-19 shooting.\n\nPuerto Rico\nAnthony Edwards scored a game-high 26 points on 11-of-15 shooting for Team USA, who won 104\u201383 over Puerto Rico to clinch the No. 1 seed in the knockout round. The Puerto Ricans were up by eight late in the first quarter. They were leading 37\u201336 with 5:45 remaining in the first half, when the Americans outscored them 28\u20138, during which James had all six of his first-half assists, to end the half ahead 64\u201345. After surrendering 29 points in the first quarter, the United States held Puerto Rico to 30 points combined in the second and third quarters.\nJames ended with 10 points, eight assists and six rebounds; he and Curry each had a game-high plus-18 in 18 minutes of play. Embiid returned to the starting lineup and had 15 points and two blocks. Durant had 11 points off the bench, and Tatum had 10 points and 10 rebounds in his second consecutive start, as the United States had six players score in double figures. Holiday sat out the game after spraining his ankle in the previous game against South Sudan. According to Kerr, \"He would've played had this been a medal-round game\". Jose Alvarado, Puerto Rico's only active NBA player, had a team-high 18 points. Despite being at a size disadvantage, they outrebounded Team USA 51\u201348 and grabbed 18 offensive rebounds. However, the Americans forced 16 turnovers and had 22 fast break points compared to 12 for the Puerto Ricans.\n\nKnockout round\nEntering the knockout round as the No. 1 seed, the United States was placed in the opposite bracket from the other group winners, Germany and Canada, as well as France. Team USA opened against Brazil, who was 1\u20132 in Group B. For the second straight Olympics, the Americans defeated the French in the gold\u2013medal game, having won over France 87\u201382 in the 2020 Olympics. The United States improved their record to 4\u20130 in gold medal games versus France.\n\nQuarterfinal \u2013 Brazil\nDevin Booker led the Americans with a team-high 18 points in a decisive 122\u201387 win over Brazil. The United States jumped out to a 10-point lead after four minutes and were ahead by 12 after one quarter. After a quick run by Brazil brought them to within eight in the middle of the second quarter, Team USA went on a 21\u20132 run for a 63\u201336 halftime lead.  In 12 first-half minutes, Embiid had 14 points and seven rebounds, shooting 5 of 6 and making two 3-pointers. For the game, the United States shot 57.7% and made 15 three-pointers, as every player scored.\nEmbiid sat out the second half as a precaution after rolling his ankle. James had 12 points and nine assists before exiting the game in the third quarter after being elbowed above his left eye by Brazil's Georginho while going for a rebound; James needed four stitches. Durant had 11 points and became Team USA's all-time leading Olympic scorer, either men's or women's, passing Lisa Leslie's mark of 488. Tatum was the 11th American to enter the game when Booker got into foul trouble in the second quarter. For the second time in U.S. Olympic history, Team USA scored 100 or more points in each of their first four games, joining the 1992 team. Brazil's Bruno Caboclo scored a game-high 30 points.\n\nSemifinal \u2013 Serbia\nCurry scored 36 points while shooting 9 of 14 on 3-pointers as the United States overcame a 17-point deficit to win 95\u201391 over Serbia. Team USA trailed for over 35 of the game's 40 minutes. Curry scored 14 of their first 15 points and made five 3-pointers in the first quarter, but the Serbs still led 31\u201323 at the end of the quarter after shooting 11 of 17 and making 5 of 9 on 3s. Serbia was ahead by 17 in the second quarter and led by 11 at halftime after making ten 3-pointers in the first half. They were leading by 13 entering the fourth quarter and were up 11 with 7:19 remaining when the Americans took control, outscoring the Serbs 32\u201315 in the fourth quarter. After shooting 15 of 30 on 3-pointers through three quarters, Serbia shot 0 of 9 from deep in the last 10 minutes. They had made five 3-pointers and scored at least 22 points in each of the first three quarters. Curry made the go-ahead 3-pointer with 2:24 left in the game, and scored seven of his team's final 11 points. James played the entire final period, recording 6 points, 6 rebounds and 4 assists, to finish with 16 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists for an unprecedented second career triple-double in the Olympics.\nCurry exceeded his combined scoring total over the first four U.S. games, in which he had 29 points on 10-of-28 shooting. Embiid scored 19 points on 8-of-11 shooting and added four rebounds in 27 minutes; he scored seven straight points in the fourth quarter. Durant was scoreless until late in the third quarter, before scoring seven of his nine points in the fourth. As in their group play game against Serbia, Tatum did not play for Team USA; Haliburton  was also held out. Bogdan Bogdanovi\u0107 had 20 points for Serbia, and Joki\u0107 scored 17 points and added 11 assists in 38 minutes. Aleksa Avramovi\u0107, Ognjen Dobri\u0107, and Marko Guduri\u0107 were a combined 9 of 14 on their 3-pointers.\n\nFinal \u2013 France\nCurry scored all 24 of his points on 3-pointers in a 98\u201387 win over France for the Americans' fifth consecutive Olympic gold medal. Team USA took a 29\u201327 lead in the middle of the second quarter and never trailed again. They expanded their lead to double digits before halftime before ending the half up 49\u201341. Ahead by 14 early in the third quarter, the Americans' offense sputtered, and France went on a 12\u20134 run and pulled to 72\u201366 entering the final quarter. They got to within three points with 3:02 remaining, but Curry made four 3-pointers in the final 2:47 to secure the victory. His final one came after a 3-pointer by Victor Wembanyama brought France to within 93\u201387 with 54.4 seconds to go. Curry forced an off-balance shot over Nicolas Batum and Evan Fournier to put the United States up 96\u201387 with 35 seconds remaining. \"I was kind of like, 'What the (expletive)'\", said Adebayo. \"Then I remembered who was shooting it.\" Curry put his hands to the side of his head, a celebratory move that he calls \"Night Night\", signalling to the other team that it is time for them to go to sleep.\nJames finished with 14 points, six rebounds and 10 assists. In his first start of the tournament, Durant scored 15 and became the first four-time gold medalist in Olympic men's basketball history. Booker also had 15 points. The Americans shot 18 of 36 on 3-pointers compared to the French's 9-of-30. Wembanyama scored a game-high 26 points and added seven rebounds, as he teamed with Guerschon Yabusele (20 points) to account for over half of their team's scoring. In his first Olympics, the NBA Rookie of the Year Wembanyama scored the second-most points ever against the United States in a gold-medal game, one less than Dra\u017een Dalipagi\u0107's 27 for Yugoslavia against the 1976 team. French coach Vincent Collet regretted his team's 10-for-17 free-throw shooting and bungled scoring opportunities. \"I was expecting more, but you have to do the perfect game. We had a chance. We didn't take it,\" said Collet.\n\nStatistics\nBold denotes team high\nSource:\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nUSA Basketball","3":"The Avenger Air Defense System, designated AN\/TWQ-1 under the Joint Electronics Type Designation System, is an American self-propelled surface-to-air missile system which provides mobile, short-range air defense protection for ground units against cruise missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles, low-flying fixed-wing aircraft, and helicopters.\nThe Avenger was originally developed for the United States Armed Forces and is currently used by the U.S. Army. The Avenger system was also used by the U.S. Marine Corps.\n\nHistory\nOriginally developed as a private venture by Boeing in the 1980s, the Avenger was developed over a period of only 10 months from initial concept to delivery for testing to the U.S. Army. Initial testing was conducted in May 1984 at the Army's Yakima Training Center in the U.S. state of Washington. During testing three FIM-92 Stinger missiles were fired.  During the first test firing the system achieved a direct hit while the Avenger was moving at 20 miles per hour (32 km\/h).\nThe second test firing, conducted at night while stationary, also achieved a direct hit. The third test firing, conducted while on the move and in the rain, did not achieve a direct hit, but did pass within the missile's kill range, so the shot was scored as a tactical kill. All three test shots were conducted by operators who had never fired the missile before.\nIn 1987, the U.S. Army awarded the first production contract for 325 units. In 1989, the system began its Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) series of tests. The tests were conducted in two stages with Stage 1 consisting of acquisition and tracking trials at Fort Hunter Liggett, California, and Stage 2 consisting of live-fire testing at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico. In February 1990, the Avenger system was deemed operationally effective and began replacing the M163 and M167 VADS. Two variants were deployed based on the Humvee chassis: M998 HMMWV Avenger and M1097 Heavy HMMWV Avenger.\nThe first operational deployment of the system occurred during the buildup for the Persian Gulf War. With the success of this deployment, the U.S. Army signed an additional contract for another 679 vehicles, bringing the total order to 1,004 units. The Avenger was again deployed in support of NATO operations during the Bosnian War. The Avenger system received widespread public exposure when it was placed around the Pentagon during the first anniversary of the September 11 attacks of 2001. The Avenger was also deployed during the U.S. military's operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.\nIn 2004, the U.S. Army had 26 battalions with Avenger Short-Range Air Defense (SHORAD) capabilities, but prioritization of other weapon systems during operations in Afghanistan and Iraq caused that number to drop to nine by early 2017, of which two were within the active force and seven were in the Army National Guard. Of the over 1,100 Avengers built only about 400 remain in service. In March 2018, in response to renewed Russian aggression since the 2014 annexation of Crimea, the 678th Air Defense Artillery Brigade deployed to Europe, the first time an American air defense unit had been sent there since the Cold War. The Army plans to deploy 72 Avenger sets to support U.S. European Command.\nDuring protests regarding the Dakota Access Pipeline near Standing Rock, the North Dakota National Guard deployed an Avenger system as an observation platform. It was employed for over a month to observe areas within Morton County where numerous instances of criminal trespass and mischief had occurred. The unarmed Avenger was used to support public safety in southern Morton County. The Avenger system was removed in order to deescalate any tensions its presence may have caused.\nIn April 2017, an Avenger fired Stingers at two UAVs in a test on Eglin Air Force Base, marking the missile's first interception of a UAV target. While Stingers are usually loaded with direct impact warheads for use against aircraft and cruise missiles, these were equipped with proximity fuzes that enabled them to detonate near the target, giving them the ability to destroy small UAVs. Since small UAVs do not produce large heat signatures, the Avenger uses a laser rangefinder in combination with an antenna on the warhead to direct the missile on target. The Stingers shot down an MQM-170C Outlaw and a smaller, unidentified system, demonstrating the fuze's ability to detect and destroy moving mini-drones weighing as little as 2\u201320 kg (4.4\u201344.1 lb).\nOn 30 September 2020, the U.S. Army awarded General Dynamics a contract to deliver the Interim Maneuver SHORAD (IM-SHORAD), a Stryker armored vehicle fitted with heavier weapons to replace the outdated, unarmored, and undergunned Avenger Humvee.\nIn November 2022, four Avenger air defense systems were included as part of a $400 million military aid package supporting Ukraine during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine to defend critical civilian infrastructure against cruise missile and Iranian-made Shahed-136 lethal drone attacks which were launched by Russia in October 2022. Another eight were included in a package in January 2023. The first arrived in Europe in early February and were seen in service by late March. Ukraine has received some 12 units, as of June 2023, with the crews being trained in Europe by United States instructors.\n\nOverview\nThe Avenger comes mainly in three configurations, the Basic, Slew-to-Cue, and the Up-Gun.\nThe Basic configuration consists of a gyro-stabilized air defense turret mounted on a modified heavy Humvee. The turret has two Stinger missile launcher pods, each capable of firing up to 4 fire-and-forget infrared\/ultraviolet guided missiles in rapid succession. The Avenger can be linked to the Forward Area Air Defense Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (FAAD C3I) system, which permits external radar tracks and messages to be passed to the fire unit to alert and cue the gunner.\nThe Slew-to-Cue (STC) subsystem allows the commander or gunner to select a FAAD C3I reported target for engagement from a display on a Targeting Console developed from VT Miltope's Pony PCU. Once the target has been selected, the turret can be automatically slewed directly to the target with limited interaction by the gunner.\nThe Up-Gun Avenger was developed specifically for the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment for the Regiment's 2005 deployment to Iraq. The modification was designed to allow the Avenger to perform unit and asset defense in addition to its air defense mission. The right missile pod was removed and the M3P 12.7 mm (.50) cal machine gun was moved to the pod's former position. This allowed for the removal of the turret's cab safety limits which enabled the gun to be fired directly in front of the HMMWV. Eight of the unit's Avengers were modified to this configuration. With the 3rd ACR's redeployment from Iraq, the Up-Gun Avenger completed its role in Operation Iraqi Freedom and the Avengers have been scheduled to be converted back to STC systems.\n\nVariants\nBoeing\/Shorts Starstreak Avenger\nBoeing teamed with Shorts Brothers PLC (now part of Thales) to offer an Avenger system in which one Stinger pod was replaced with a pod of four Starstreak Hyper-velocity laser-guided missiles, in the hopes of attracting a U.S. Army contract under the Forward Area Air Defense System Line-of-Sight Rear (FAADS-LOS-R) program. Test installation was carried out in mid-1990 and firing trials followed from mid-1991 in the U.K. Starstreak would have complemented the Stinger by improving the overall systems ability to deal with low hovering helicopters which frequently do not provide enough contrast for lock-on by infrared guided missiles.  Starstreak also has the ability to be used against un-armored and lightly armored ground vehicles.\n\nBoeing\/Matra Guardian\nIn the 1990s Boeing teamed with Matra of France to offer the Avenger modified by the substitution of standard triple launcher boxes for Matra Mistral missiles in place of the quadruple Stinger pods of the standard Avenger. One demonstrator vehicle was built in 1992 and test firings took place in France.  The project was dropped around 1997.\n\nAvengers during the Iraq War\nDue to the lack of serious airborne threats  during much of the Iraq War, along with the pressing need for ground assets for combat roles such as convoy protection, the Avenger was pressed into this role. The FLIR\/laser rangefinder combined with the 12.7 mm (.50) cal machine gun has proved to be very effective, but was limited by no-fire zones, particularly to the front of the vehicle. A program was instituted to remove one of the missile pods and move the machine gun to that position to enable a 360\u00b0 field of fire. The upgrade also increased the ammunition capacity to 650 rounds.\n\nAvenger DEW\nAnother potential variant proposed by Boeing is an Avenger with a Directed Energy Weapon (DEW).  Boeing completed an initial test of a 1 kW laser mounted where the right missile pod would be.  The M3P 12.7 mm (.50) cal has been replaced by the M242 Bushmaster as its close defense weapon.\n\nAvenger Multi-Role Weapon System\nTest firing demonstrations of this variant took place in 2004. It is modified by re-locating the M3P machine gun over the turret cab to allow a 360-degree field of fire, increasing ready-use machine gun ammunition stowage to 600 rounds, and providing the option to substitute launchers for 2 FGM-148 Javelin missiles in place of 1 Stinger pod.\n\nAccelerated Improved Interceptor Initiative (AI3)\nIn February 2012, Raytheon was awarded a contract to develop the AI3, a modified AIM-9 Sidewinder missile mounted on the Avenger launcher, to perform counter rocket, artillery, mortar (C-RAM), counter unmanned aerial vehicle (C-UAV), and counter cruise missile duties.\nIn 2013, the US Army decided to not buy the system.\nIn August 2014, the system successfully intercepted a UAV and cruise missile target featuring a semi-active radar homing seeker in a test.\n\nOther variants\nBoeing have proposed that the Avenger PMS turret could be mounted on other vehicles such as Unimog truck, BV-206 all-terrain vehicles, M113 APC, and M548 tracked cargo carrier as well as being used as a stationary ground mount on a pallet for defense of static targets. The Avenger PMS has been demonstrated with a mock-up of two 70 mm helicopter-type rocket pods carrying a total of 36 rockets to give the system greater multi-mission utility.  Other missiles such as the Bofors RBS 70\/Bolide have been proposed for use on the Avenger PMS.\nIn March 2017, Boeing revealed a modernized Avenger system fitted with AIM-9X Sidewinder and Longbow Hellfire missiles on the sides and a directed energy weapon affixed to the top.  It is also planned to be integrated onto other platforms including the JLTV, Stryker, and Bradley Fighting Vehicle. While Boeing had configured a Stryker with the Avenger turret to fulfill the Army's Interim Maneuver-Short-Range Air Defense (IM-SHORAD) requirement, the Army ultimately decided against the idea, feeling it would require major modifications to the vehicle and because of the company's desire for the service to supply the turrets, of which there were a limited amount existing readily in the inventory.\nDuring a 2017 joint French-Egyptian naval exercise, an AN\/TWQ-1 Avenger was mounted onto the helicopter flight deck of a Mistral-class amphibious assault ship to provide ad-hoc close-range air defense. The ship was originally slated to be sold to Russia, but the sale was canceled due to international sanctions imposed on Russia following the Annexation of Crimea. The ship was sold to the Egyptian navy without the originally planned Russian air defense systems.\n\nSpecifications\nDimensions\nLength \u2013 16 feet 3 inches (4.95 m)\nWidth \u2013 7 feet 2 inches (2.18 m)\nHeight \u2013 8 feet 8 inches (2.64 m)\nWeight \u2013 8,600 pounds (3,900 kg)\nCrew \u2013 2 (Basic), 3 (STC)\nRoad speed \u2013 55 miles per hour (89 km\/h)\nRange \u2013 275 miles (443 km)\nEngine \u2013 Detroit Diesel cooled V-8\nEngine power output \u2013 135 horsepower (101 kW)\n\nSensors\nForward Looking Infrared Receiver (FLIR)\nEye Safe Laser rangefinder\nOptical sight\n\nWeapons\n4\/8 ready-to-fire FIM-92 Stinger missiles\nOne FN M3P machine gun built by FN Herstal, a variant of the Browning AN\/M3 developed for aviation use during World War II.

The fundamental particles of nature have minimum vibrational motion, retaining only quantum mechanical, zero-point energy-induced particle motion. The theoretical temperature is determined by extrapolating the ideal gas law; by international agreement, absolute zero is taken as 0 kelvin (International System of Units), which is \u2212273.15 degrees on the Celsius scale, and equals \u2212459.67 degrees on the Fahrenheit scale (United States customary units or imperial units). The Kelvin and Rankine temperature scales set their zero points at absolute zero by definition.\nIt is commonly thought of as the lowest temperature possible, but it is not the lowest enthalpy state possible, because all real substances begin to depart from the ideal gas when cooled as they approach the change of state to liquid, and then to solid; and the sum of the enthalpy of vaporization (gas to liquid) and enthalpy of fusion (liquid to solid) exceeds the ideal gas's change in enthalpy to absolute zero. In the quantum-mechanical description, matter at absolute zero is in its ground state, the point of lowest internal energy.\nThe laws of thermodynamics indicate that absolute zero cannot be reached using only thermodynamic means, because the temperature of the substance being cooled approaches the temperature of the cooling agent asymptotically. Even a system at absolute zero, if it could somehow be achieved, would still possess quantum mechanical zero-point energy, the energy of its ground state at absolute zero; the kinetic energy of the ground state cannot be removed. \nScientists and technologists routinely achieve temperatures close to absolute zero, where matter exhibits quantum effects such as\nsuperconductivity, superfluidity, and Bose\u2013Einstein condensation.\n\nThermodynamics near absolute zero\nAt temperatures near 0 K (\u2212273.15 \u00b0C; \u2212459.67 \u00b0F), nearly all molecular motion ceases and \u0394S = 0 for any adiabatic process, where S is the entropy. In such a circumstance, pure substances can (ideally) form perfect crystals with no structural imperfections as T \u2192 0. Max Planck's strong form of the third law of thermodynamics states the entropy of a perfect crystal vanishes at absolute zero. The original Nernst heat theorem makes the weaker and less controversial claim that the entropy change for any isothermal process approaches zero as T \u2192 0:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          lim\n          \n            T\n            \u2192\n            0\n          \n        \n        \u0394\n        S\n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lim _{T\\to 0}\\Delta S=0}\n  \n\nThe implication is that the entropy of a perfect crystal approaches a constant value. An adiabat is a state with constant entropy, typically represented on a graph as a curve in a manner similar to isotherms and isobars.\n\nThe Nernst postulate identifies the isotherm T = 0 as coincident with the adiabat S = 0, although other isotherms and adiabats are distinct. As no two adiabats intersect, no other adiabat can intersect the T = 0 isotherm. Consequently no adiabatic process initiated at nonzero temperature can lead to zero temperature. (\u2248 Callen, pp. 189\u2013190)\nA perfect crystal is one in which the internal lattice structure extends uninterrupted in all directions. The perfect order can be represented by translational symmetry along three (not usually orthogonal) axes. Every lattice element of the structure is in its proper place, whether it is a single atom or a molecular grouping. For substances that exist in two (or more) stable crystalline forms, such as diamond and graphite for carbon, there is a kind of chemical degeneracy. The question remains whether both can have zero entropy at T = 0 even though each is perfectly ordered.\nPerfect crystals never occur in practice; imperfections, and even entire amorphous material inclusions, can and do get \"frozen in\" at low temperatures, so transitions to more stable states do not occur.\nUsing the Debye model, the specific heat and entropy of a pure crystal are proportional to T 3, while the enthalpy and chemical potential are proportional to T 4. (Guggenheim, p. 111) These quantities drop toward their T = 0 limiting values and approach with zero slopes. For the specific heats at least, the limiting value itself is definitely zero, as borne out by experiments to below 10 K. Even the less detailed Einstein model shows this curious drop in specific heats. In fact, all specific heats vanish at absolute zero, not just those of crystals. Likewise for the coefficient of thermal expansion. Maxwell's relations show that various other quantities also vanish. These phenomena were unanticipated.\nSince the relation between changes in Gibbs free energy (G), the enthalpy (H) and the entropy is\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u0394\n        G\n        =\n        \u0394\n        H\n        \u2212\n        T\n        \u0394\n        S\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Delta G=\\Delta H-T\\Delta S\\,}\n  \n\nthus, as T decreases, \u0394G and \u0394H approach each other (so long as \u0394S is bounded). Experimentally, it is found that all spontaneous processes (including chemical reactions) result in a decrease in G as they proceed toward equilibrium. If \u0394S and\/or T are small, the condition \u0394G < 0 may imply that \u0394H < 0, which would indicate an exothermic reaction. However, this is not required; endothermic reactions can proceed spontaneously if the T\u0394S term is large enough.\nMoreover, the slopes of the derivatives of \u0394G and \u0394H converge and are equal to zero at T = 0. This ensures that \u0394G and \u0394H are nearly the same over a considerable range of temperatures and justifies the approximate empirical Principle of Thomsen and Berthelot, which states that the equilibrium state to which a system proceeds is the one that evolves the greatest amount of heat, i.e., an actual process is the most exothermic one. (Callen, pp. 186\u2013187)\nOne model that estimates the properties of an electron gas at absolute zero in metals is the Fermi gas. The electrons, being fermions, must be in different quantum states, which leads the electrons to get very high typical velocities, even at absolute zero. The maximum energy that electrons can have at absolute zero is called the Fermi energy. The Fermi temperature is defined as this maximum energy divided by the Boltzmann constant, and is on the order of 80,000 K for typical electron densities found in metals. For temperatures significantly below the Fermi temperature, the electrons behave in almost the same way as at absolute zero. This explains the failure of the classical equipartition theorem for metals that eluded classical physicists in the late 19th century.\n\nRelation with Bose\u2013Einstein condensate\nA Bose\u2013Einstein condensate (BEC) is a state of matter of a dilute gas of weakly interacting bosons confined in an external potential and cooled to temperatures very near absolute zero. Under such conditions, a large fraction of the bosons occupy the lowest quantum state of the external potential, at which point quantum effects become apparent on a macroscopic scale.\nThis state of matter was first predicted by Satyendra Nath Bose and Albert Einstein in 1924\u201325. Bose first sent a paper to Einstein on the quantum statistics of light quanta (now called photons). Einstein was impressed, translated the paper from English to German and submitted it for Bose to the Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik, which published it. Einstein then extended Bose's ideas to material particles (or matter) in two other papers.\nSeventy years later, in 1995, the first gaseous condensate was produced by Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman at the University of Colorado at Boulder NIST-JILA lab, using a gas of rubidium atoms cooled to 170 nanokelvin (nK) (1.7\u00d710\u22127 K).\nIn 2003, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) achieved a temperature of 450 \u00b1 80 picokelvin (pK) (4.5\u00d710\u221210 K) in a BEC of sodium atoms. The associated black-body (peak emittance) wavelength of 6.4 megameters is roughly the radius of Earth.\nIn 2021, University of Bremen physicists achieved a BEC with a temperature of only 38 pK, the current coldest temperature record.\n\nAbsolute temperature scales\nAbsolute, or thermodynamic, temperature is conventionally measured in kelvin (Celsius-scaled increments) and in the Rankine scale (Fahrenheit-scaled increments) with increasing rarity. Absolute temperature measurement is uniquely determined by a multiplicative constant which specifies the size of the degree, so the ratios of two absolute temperatures, T2\/T1, are the same in all scales. The most transparent definition of this standard comes from the Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution. It can also be found in Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics (for particles of half-integer spin) and Bose\u2013Einstein statistics (for particles of integer spin). All of these define the relative numbers of particles in a system as decreasing exponential functions of energy (at the particle level) over kT, with k representing the Boltzmann constant and T representing the temperature observed at the macroscopic level.\n\nNegative temperatures\nTemperatures that are expressed as negative numbers on the familiar Celsius or Fahrenheit scales are simply colder than the zero points of those scales. Certain systems can achieve truly negative temperatures; that is, their thermodynamic temperature (expressed in kelvins) can be of a negative quantity. A system with a truly negative temperature is not colder than absolute zero. Rather, a system with a negative temperature is hotter than any system with a positive temperature, in the sense that if a negative-temperature system and a positive-temperature system come in contact, heat flows from the negative to the positive-temperature system.\nMost familiar systems cannot achieve negative temperatures because adding energy always increases their entropy. However, some systems have a maximum amount of energy that they can hold, and as they approach that maximum energy their entropy actually begins to decrease. Because temperature is defined by the relationship between energy and entropy, such a system's temperature becomes negative, even though energy is being added. As a result, the Boltzmann factor for states of systems at negative temperature increases rather than decreases with increasing state energy. Therefore, no complete system, i.e. including the electromagnetic modes, can have negative temperatures, since there is no highest energy state, so that the sum of the probabilities of the states would diverge for negative temperatures. However, for quasi-equilibrium systems (e.g. spins out of equilibrium with the electromagnetic field) this argument does not apply, and negative effective temperatures are attainable.\nOn 3 January 2013, physicists announced that for the first time they had created a quantum gas made up of potassium atoms with a negative temperature in motional degrees of freedom.\n\nHistory\nOne of the first to discuss the possibility of an absolute minimal temperature was Robert Boyle. His 1665 New Experiments and Observations touching Cold, articulated the dispute known as the primum frigidum. The concept was well known among naturalists of the time. Some contended an absolute minimum temperature occurred within earth (as one of the four classical elements), others within water, others air, and some more recently within nitre. But all of them seemed to agree that, \"There is some body or other that is of its own nature supremely cold and by participation of which all other bodies obtain that quality.\"\n\nLimit to the \"degree of cold\"\nThe question of whether there is a limit to the degree of coldness possible, and, if so, where the zero must be placed, was first addressed by the French physicist Guillaume Amontons in 1703, in connection with his improvements in the air thermometer. His instrument indicated temperatures by the height at which a certain mass of air sustained a column of mercury\u2014the pressure, or \"spring\" of the air varying with temperature. Amontons therefore argued that the zero of his thermometer would be that temperature at which the spring of the air was reduced to nothing. He used a scale that marked the boiling point of water at +73 and the melting point of ice at +51+1\u20442, so that the zero was equivalent to about \u2212240 on the Celsius scale. Amontons held that the absolute zero cannot be reached, so never attempted to compute it explicitly.\nThe value of \u2212240 \u00b0C, or \"431 divisions [in Fahrenheit's thermometer] below the cold of freezing water\" was published by George Martine in 1740.\nThis close approximation to the modern value of \u2212273.15 \u00b0C for the zero of the air thermometer was further improved upon in 1779 by Johann Heinrich Lambert, who observed that \u2212270 \u00b0C (\u2212454.00 \u00b0F; 3.15 K) might be regarded as absolute cold.\nValues of this order for the absolute zero were not, however, universally accepted about this period. Pierre-Simon Laplace and Antoine Lavoisier, in their 1780 treatise on heat, arrived at values ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 below the freezing point of water, and thought that in any case it must be at least 600 below. John Dalton in his Chemical Philosophy gave ten calculations of this value, and finally adopted \u22123,000 \u00b0C as the natural zero of temperature.\n\nCharles's law\nFrom 1787 to 1802, it was determined by Jacques Charles (unpublished), John Dalton, and Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac that, at constant pressure, ideal gases expanded or contracted their volume linearly (Charles's law) by about 1\/273 parts per degree Celsius of temperature's change up or down, between 0\u00b0 and 100\u00b0 C. This suggested that the volume of a gas cooled at about \u2212273 \u00b0C would reach zero.\n\nLord Kelvin's work\nAfter James Prescott Joule had determined the mechanical equivalent of heat, Lord Kelvin approached the question from an entirely different point of view, and in 1848 devised a scale of absolute temperature that was independent of the properties of any particular substance and was based on Carnot's theory of the Motive Power of Heat and data published by Henri Victor Regnault. It followed from the principles on which this scale was constructed that its zero was placed at \u2212273 \u00b0C, at almost precisely the same point as the zero of the air thermometer, where the air volume would reach \"nothing\". This value was not immediately accepted; values ranging from \u2212271.1 \u00b0C (\u2212455.98 \u00b0F) to \u2212274.5 \u00b0C (\u2212462.10 \u00b0F), derived from laboratory measurements and observations of astronomical refraction, remained in use in the early 20th century.\n\nThe race to absolute zero\nWith a better theoretical understanding of absolute zero, scientists were eager to reach this temperature in the lab. By 1845, Michael Faraday had managed to liquefy most gases then known to exist, and reached a new record for lowest temperatures by reaching \u2212130 \u00b0C (\u2212202 \u00b0F; 143 K). Faraday believed that certain gases, such as oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen, were permanent gases and could not be liquefied. Decades later, in 1873 Dutch theoretical scientist Johannes Diderik van der Waals demonstrated that these gases could be liquefied, but only under conditions of very high pressure and very low temperatures. In 1877, Louis Paul Cailletet in France and Raoul Pictet in Switzerland succeeded in producing the first droplets of liquid air at \u2212195 \u00b0C (\u2212319.0 \u00b0F; 78.1 K). This was followed in 1883 by the production of liquid oxygen \u2212218 \u00b0C (\u2212360.4 \u00b0F; 55.1 K) by the Polish professors Zygmunt Wr\u00f3blewski and Karol Olszewski.\nScottish chemist and physicist James Dewar and Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes took on the challenge to liquefy the remaining gases, hydrogen and helium. In 1898, after 20 years of effort, Dewar was the first to liquefy hydrogen, reaching a new low-temperature record of \u2212252 \u00b0C (\u2212421.6 \u00b0F; 21.1 K). However, Kamerlingh Onnes, his rival, was the first to liquefy helium, in 1908, using several precooling stages and the Hampson\u2013Linde cycle. He lowered the temperature to the boiling point of helium \u2212269 \u00b0C (\u2212452.20 \u00b0F; 4.15 K). By reducing the pressure of the liquid helium, he achieved an even lower temperature, near 1.5 K. These were the coldest temperatures achieved on Earth at the time and his achievement earned him the Nobel Prize in 1913. Kamerlingh Onnes would continue to study the properties of materials at temperatures near absolute zero, describing superconductivity and superfluids for the first time.\n\nVery low temperatures\nThe average temperature of the universe today is approximately 2.73 kelvins (\u2212454.76 \u00b0F), or about \u2212270.42 \u00b0C, based on measurements of cosmic microwave background radiation. Standard models of the future expansion of the universe predict that the average temperature of the universe is decreasing over time. This temperature is calculated as the mean density of energy in space; it should not be confused with the mean electron temperature (total energy divided by particle count) which has increased over time.\nAbsolute zero cannot be achieved, although it is possible to reach temperatures close to it through the use of evaporative cooling, cryocoolers, dilution refrigerators, and nuclear adiabatic demagnetization. The use of laser cooling has produced temperatures of less than a billionth of a kelvin. At very low temperatures in the vicinity of absolute zero, matter exhibits many unusual properties, including superconductivity, superfluidity, and Bose\u2013Einstein condensation. To study such phenomena, scientists have worked to obtain even lower temperatures.\n\nIn November 2000, nuclear spin temperatures below 100 pK were reported for an experiment at the Helsinki University of Technology's Low Temperature Lab in Espoo, Finland. However, this was the temperature of one particular degree of freedom\u2014a quantum property called nuclear spin\u2014not the overall average thermodynamic temperature for all possible degrees in freedom.\nIn February 2003, the Boomerang Nebula was observed to have been releasing gases at a speed of 500,000 km\/h (310,000 mph) for the last 1,500 years. This has cooled it down to approximately 1 K, as deduced by astronomical observation, which is the lowest natural temperature ever recorded.\nIn November 2003, 90377 Sedna was discovered and is one of the coldest known objects in the Solar System. With an average surface temperature of -400\u00b0F (-240\u00b0C), due to its extremely far orbit of 903 astronomical units.\nIn May 2005, the European Space Agency proposed research in space to achieve femtokelvin temperatures.\nIn May 2006, the Institute of Quantum Optics at the University of Hannover gave details of technologies and benefits of femtokelvin research in space.\nIn January 2013, physicist Ulrich Schneider of the University of Munich in Germany reported to have achieved temperatures formally below absolute zero (\"negative temperature\") in gases. The gas is artificially forced out of equilibrium into a high potential energy state, which is, however, cold. When it then emits radiation it approaches the equilibrium, and can continue emitting despite reaching formal absolute zero; thus, the temperature is formally negative.\nIn September 2014, scientists in the CUORE collaboration at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy cooled a copper vessel with a volume of one cubic meter to 0.006 kelvins (\u2212273.144 \u00b0C; \u2212459.659 \u00b0F) for 15 days, setting a record for the lowest temperature in the known universe over such a large contiguous volume.\nIn June 2015, experimental physicists at MIT cooled molecules in a gas of sodium potassium to a temperature of 500 nanokelvin, and it is expected to exhibit an exotic state of matter by cooling these molecules somewhat further.\nIn 2017, Cold Atom Laboratory (CAL), an experimental instrument was developed for launch to the International Space Station (ISS) in 2018. The instrument has created extremely cold conditions in the microgravity environment of the ISS leading to the formation of Bose\u2013Einstein condensates. In this space-based laboratory, temperatures as low as 1 picokelvin (10\u221212 K) are projected to be achievable, and it could further the exploration of unknown quantum mechanical phenomena and test some of the most fundamental laws of physics.\nThe current world record for effective temperatures was set in 2021 at 38 picokelvin (pK) through matter-wave lensing of rubidium Bose\u2013Einstein condensates.\n\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nHerbert B.

The aircraft was supplied as a kit for amateur construction.\n\nDesign and development\nWith three-axis controls, the Avenger was intended to appeal to conventional light aircraft pilots and was designed to comply with the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles rules, including the category's maximum empty weight of 254 lb (115 kg). The Avenger's standard empty weight is 252 lb (114 kg). It has a strut-braced high-wing, single-seat, open cockpit, single pusher engine configuration, and is equipped with tricycle landing gear using nosewheel steering.\nThe aircraft is made from bolted-together aluminium tubing, with the wings and tail covered in Dacron sailcloth. The fuselage consists of a single aluminium keel tube that runs from the tail surfaces to the nose wheel. The cockpit is an open seat bolted to the main keel tube. Its 31 ft (9.4 m) span wing has an 80% double surface and features half-span ailerons. The wing is supported by dual parallel lift struts with jury struts. The tricycle landing gear has pneumatic shock suspension and the nosewheel is steerable. There is also a small tail caster as the aircraft sits on its tail with no occupant in the pilot's seat. The landing gear has notably high ground clearance for rough field operations and the engine, mounted on the wing trailing edge, drives a propeller that is protected by the low-mounted tailboom. The standard engine supplied was the Cuyuna 430 of 30 hp (22 kW).\nAvailable as either a kit for home construction or as a complete aircraft, the Avenger was introduced in the early 1980s when the market was becoming saturated with ultralight designs; as a result, the company quickly went out of business and production ended.\n\nSpecifications\nData from Cliche and Jane'sGeneral characteristics\nCrew: one\nLength: 17 ft 0 in (5.18 m)\nWingspan: 31 ft 0 in (9.45 m)\nWing area: 135 sq ft (12.5 m2)\nAspect ratio: 7:12\nEmpty weight: 252 lb (114 kg)\nMax takeoff weight: 552 lb (250 kg)\nFuel capacity: 5 U.S. gallons (19 L; 4.2 imp gal)\nPowerplant: 1 \u00d7 Cuyuna 430 two-cylinder piston snowmobile engine, 30 hp (22 kW)\nPropellers: 2-bladed wooden\nPerformance\n\nMaximum speed: 60 mph (97 km\/h, 52 kn)\nCruise speed: 45 mph (72 km\/h, 39 kn)\nStall speed: 16 mph (26 km\/h, 14 kn)\nNever exceed speed: 70 mph (110 km\/h, 61 kn)\nRate of climb: 700 ft\/min (3.6 m\/s)\nWing loading: 4.09 lb\/sq ft (19.95 kg\/m2)\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nAirborne Avenger at the Virtual Ultralight Museum archives","6":"Alcoa Presents: One Step Beyond (also known as One Step Beyond) is an American anthology series created by Merwin Gerard. The original series was broadcast for three seasons by the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) from January 1959 to July 1961.\n\nOverview\nCreated by Merwin Gerard and produced by Collier Young, One Step Beyond was hosted by John Newland, \"your guide to the supernatural\" (also credited as \"Our guide into the world of the unknown\"). Newland, who also directed every episode, presented tales that explored paranormal events and various situations that defied \"logical\" explanation. One Step Beyond purported only to tell stories based on \"human record\" (documented historical events).\nUnlike other anthology programs, the ABC network series episodes were presented in the form of straightforward 30-minute docudramas, all said to be based on \"human record\" (implying historically factual events); however, the incidents depicted were closer to popular urban legends dramatized for the screen. The program included the corporate name of sponsor Alcoa in its title for its initial run. In syndication, the program title became simply One Step Beyond.\nOne Step Beyond filled the time slot at 10 p.m. Tuesday vacated by the crime\/police reality show Confession.\nAmong its varied tales, One Step Beyond dealt with premonition of death (\"The Day the World Wept: The Lincoln Story\") and disaster (\"Tidal Wave\", \"Night of April 14th\"); the existence of ghosts (\"The Last Round\", \"The Death Waltz\"); and wildly improbable coincidence (\"Reunion\"). Paula Raymond appeared in the third episode of the first season, initially broadcast on February 3, 1959, in the episode titled \"Emergency Only,\" which also featured Jocelyn Brando as a screaming fortune teller at a party. Joan Fontaine and Warren Beatty play husband and wife in the episode \"The Visitor.\"\n\n\"The Sacred Mushroom\"\nA January 1961 episode, \"The Sacred Mushroom,\" deals with the discovery of mind-altering drugs. Newland traveled to Mexico where he met with a local shaman who was an initiate in ritual use of magic mushrooms. The then-unknown mushrooms were purportedly able to increase the user's psychic powers. Newland ingested several mushrooms and allowed his reactions to be filmed for broadcast. This was the only episode of the entire series to have a relatively reality-based \"documentary\" tone, rather than the scripted docudramas that comprised all other episodes. Although the subject matter (the enhancement of psychic powers) accorded with the rest of the series, this episode was somewhat controversial and was omitted from the syndication; it has been seen only rarely since its original broadcast. However, according to Newland, it was the most popular episode of the series. A complete transcript of this episode is reproduced in chapter seven of The Sacred Mushrooms of Mexico by Brian Akers.\n\nWriting staff\nThe show used a large number of writers. Larry Marcus was the most prolific contributor, with over 30 episodes to his credit. Marcus would later win an Emmy for his work on Route 66, and receive an Oscar nomination for his screenplay for The Stunt Man.\nOther relatively frequent contributors included show creator Merwin Gerard; Don M. Mankiewicz (who would later write for Star Trek); Gabrielle Upton (who wrote for a wide range of anthology shows, including The Alfred Hitchcock Hour, and was later head writer of The Guiding Light); and Howard Rodman (later story editor of Route 66 and creator of Harry O).\nCharles Beaumont wrote two episodes of One Step Beyond just before jumping over to The Twilight Zone, to which he was a major contributor. Francis Cockrell also wrote two episodes; he was a frequent writer on Alfred Hitchcock Presents and would later contribute to the second season of The Outer Limits.\n\nGuest appearances\nProduction\nThe last 13 episodes of the third season were filmed at MGM Studios, Borehamwood, England, due to a suggestion by Newland. According to Newland, \"I thought it would give a little boost to the show because Great Britain offered good actors, good situations, and good settings. We sought permission from Alcoa, and they okayed it.\"\n\nMusic\nHarry Lubin composed the music for the series with a soundtrack album, Music from 'One Step Beyond' released by Decca Records (DL 8970) in 1960. The most well-known tracks of the series were entitled: \"Weird\" (originally composed by Lubin for the score of an April 1955 Loretta Young Show episode, \"Feeling No Pain\"), usually played when the supernatural aspect of the episode was being discussed, and \"Fear\" that became the musical theme of the series.\nThe Ventures included a cover version of the show's main theme music \"Fear\" in their highly acclaimed 1964 Dolton Records album The Ventures in Space. The second season of The Outer Limits used a variation of \"Fear\" for the end titles.\nA heavy metal cover of the title song was recorded by the band Fant\u00f4mas on their album The Director's Cut in 2001.\n\nEpisodes\nSeason 1 (1959)\nSeason 2 (1959\u201360)\nSeason 3 (1960\u201361)\nSyndication\nAfter its cancellation during 1961, the series continued to be shown throughout the United States in off-network syndication until the early 1980s.\nFor its re-release to television for the Sci-Fi Channel during the 1990s, the initial and end titles were given new theme music and graphics designed for the time, as if the show had continued into the 1990s. These episodes were also edited for time from 25 minutes to 22 minutes.\nDespite the public domain status for most episodes, the series' remaining copyrights belongs to its distributor CBS Television Distribution. CTD is the successor to the series' previous distributors, which include ABC Films successor Worldvision Enterprises and CTD's predecessor Paramount Domestic Television.\nEpisodes are currently broadcast by the Retro Television Network available as a digital subchannel in some US markets. Full episodes are also available for digital streaming on Amazon Prime (charge per episode as of 2021), FMC Movie Classics (free), Tubi (free), and Amazing Classics (free).\nIn May 2021 the UK nostalgia channel Talking Pictures TV began to broadcast the series, with the first episode airing on 11 May.\n\nHome media\nDelta Entertainment Corporation in 2005 released a collection of 33 (presumably public domain) episodes on eight region-free DVDs.\nDuring 2007, Mill Creek Entertainment released a 4-disc Region 1 DVD set entitled The Very Best of One Step Beyond. The set contains 50 episodes. The quality varied drastically from episode to episode.\nOn September 15, 2009, CBS Home Entertainment (distributed by Paramount under this label) released One Step Beyond - The Official 1st Season on Region 1 DVD.\nThe Film Chest Media Group released the series in a six-disc Collector's Box on April 7, 2015. The boxset contains 70 episodes of the series in total across six DVDs, which consist of all 22 episodes of Season 1, 32 of the 39 episodes of Season 2, but only 16 of the 36 episodes of Season 3. The set also includes synopses of the episodes inside.\nOne Step Beyond was the first pre-1973 in-house production of ABC to get a DVD release from CBS\/Paramount. Other shows once distributed by ABC Films (which became Worldvision Enterprises) were either released by CBS\/Paramount because the company owns the libraries of the actual producers of the shows (such as The Fugitive or The Mod Squad), or were released by different companies because ancillary rights are owned by other entities (such as George of the Jungle).\n\nThe Next Step Beyond\nDuring 1978, the series was revived partly by Gerard and Young, with John Newland hosting and directing most of the episodes; the new series was named The Next Step Beyond. The series was broadcast for one year with 25 episodes, 14 of which were remakes of One Step Beyond episodes.\n\nSee also\nReferences\nBibliography\nMuir, John (2001).

fly by gaining support from the air. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or, in a few cases, direct downward thrust from its engines. Common examples of aircraft include airplanes, helicopters, airships (including blimps), gliders, paramotors, and hot air balloons.\nThe human activity that surrounds aircraft is called aviation. The science of aviation, including designing and building aircraft, is called aeronautics. Crewed aircraft are flown by an onboard pilot, whereas unmanned aerial vehicles may be remotely controlled or self-controlled by onboard computers. Aircraft may be classified by different criteria, such as lift type, aircraft propulsion (if any), usage and others.\n\nHistory\nFlying model craft and stories of manned flight go back many centuries; however, the first manned ascent \u2014 and safe descent \u2014 in modern times took place by larger hot-air balloons developed in the 18th century. Each of the two World Wars led to great technical advances. Consequently, the history of aircraft can be divided into five eras:\n\nPioneers of flight, from the earliest experiments to 1914.\nFirst World War, 1914 to 1918.\nAviation between the World Wars, 1918 to 1939.\nSecond World War, 1939 to 1945.\nPostwar era, also called the Jet Age, 1945 to the present day.\n\nMethods of lift\nLighter than air \u2013 aerostats\nAerostats use buoyancy to float in the air in much the same way that ships float on the water. They are characterized by one or more large cells or canopies, filled with a relatively low-density gas such as helium, hydrogen, or hot air, which is less dense than the surrounding air. When the weight of this is added to the weight of the aircraft structure, it adds up to the same weight as the air that the craft displaces.\nSmall hot-air balloons, called sky lanterns, were first invented in ancient China prior to the 3rd century BC and used primarily in cultural celebrations, and were only the second type of aircraft to fly, the first being kites, which were first invented in ancient China over two thousand years ago (see Han Dynasty).\nA balloon was originally any aerostat, while the term airship was used for large, powered aircraft designs \u2014 usually fixed-wing. In 1919, Frederick Handley Page was reported as referring to \"ships of the air,\" with smaller passenger types as \"Air yachts.\" In the 1930s, large intercontinental flying boats were also sometimes referred to as \"ships of the air\" or \"flying-ships\". \u2014 though none had yet been built. The advent of powered balloons, called dirigible balloons, and later of rigid hulls allowing a great increase in size, began to change the way these words were used. Huge powered aerostats, characterized by a rigid outer framework and separate aerodynamic skin surrounding the gas bags, were produced, the Zeppelins being the largest and most famous. There were still no fixed-wing aircraft or non-rigid balloons large enough to be called airships, so \"airship\" came to be synonymous with these aircraft. Then several accidents, such as the Hindenburg disaster in 1937, led to the demise of these airships. Nowadays a \"balloon\" is an unpowered aerostat and an \"airship\" is a powered one.\nA powered, steerable aerostat is called a dirigible. Sometimes this term is applied only to non-rigid balloons, and sometimes dirigible balloon is regarded as the definition of an airship (which may then be rigid or non-rigid). Non-rigid dirigibles are characterized by a moderately aerodynamic gasbag with stabilizing fins at the back. These soon became known as blimps. During World War II, this shape was widely adopted for tethered balloons; in windy weather, this both reduces the strain on the tether and stabilizes the balloon. The nickname blimp was adopted along with the shape. In modern times, any small dirigible or airship is called a blimp, though a blimp may be unpowered as well as powered.\n\nHeavier-than-air \u2013 aerodynes\nHeavier-than-air aircraft, such as airplanes, must find some way to push air or gas downwards so that a reaction occurs (by Newton's laws of motion) to push the aircraft upwards. This dynamic movement through the air is the origin of the term. There are two ways to produce dynamic upthrust \u2014 aerodynamic lift, and powered lift in the form of engine thrust.\nAerodynamic lift involving wings is the most common, with fixed-wing aircraft being kept in the air by the forward movement of wings, and rotorcraft by spinning wing-shaped rotors sometimes called \"rotary wings.\" A wing is a flat, horizontal surface, usually shaped in cross-section as an aerofoil. To fly, air must flow over the wing and generate lift. A flexible wing is a wing made of fabric or thin sheet material, often stretched over a rigid frame. A kite is tethered to the ground and relies on the speed of the wind over its wings, which may be flexible or rigid, fixed, or rotary.\nWith powered lift, the aircraft directs its engine thrust vertically downward. V\/STOL aircraft, such as the Harrier jump jet and Lockheed Martin F-35B take off and land vertically using powered lift and transfer to aerodynamic lift in steady flight.\nA pure rocket is not usually regarded as an aerodyne because it does not depend on the air for its lift (and can even fly into space); however, many aerodynamic lift vehicles have been powered or assisted by rocket motors. Rocket-powered missiles that obtain aerodynamic lift at very high speed due to airflow over their bodies are a marginal case.\n\nFixed-wing\nThe forerunner of the fixed-wing aircraft is the kite. Whereas a fixed-wing aircraft relies on its forward speed to create airflow over the wings, a kite is tethered to the ground and relies on the wind blowing over its wings to provide lift. Kites were the first kind of aircraft to fly and were invented in China around 500 BC. Much aerodynamic research was done with kites before test aircraft, wind tunnels, and computer modelling programs became available.\nThe first heavier-than-air craft capable of controlled free-flight were gliders. A glider designed by George Cayley carried out the first true manned, controlled flight in 1853. The first powered and controllable fixed-wing aircraft (the airplane or aeroplane) was invented by Wilbur and Orville Wright.\nBesides the method of propulsion (if any), fixed-wing aircraft are in general characterized by their wing configuration. The most important wing characteristics are:\n\nNumber of wings \u2014 Monoplane, biplane, triplane, or multiplane.\nWing support \u2014 Braced or cantilever, rigid or flexible.\nWing planform \u2014 including aspect ratio, angle of sweep, and any variations along the span (including the important class of delta wings).\nLocation of the horizontal stabilizer, if any.\nDihedral angle \u2014 positive, zero, or negative (anhedral).\nA variable geometry aircraft can change its wing configuration during flight.\nA flying wing has no fuselage, though it may have small blisters or pods. The opposite of this is a lifting body, which has no wings, though it may have small stabilizing and control surfaces.\nWing-in-ground-effect vehicles are generally not considered aircraft. They \"fly\" efficiently close to the surface of the ground or water, like conventional aircraft during takeoff. An example is the Russian ekranoplan nicknamed the \"Caspian Sea Monster\". Man-powered aircraft also rely on ground effect to remain airborne with minimal pilot power, but this is only because they are so underpowered\u2014in fact, the airframe is capable of flying higher.\n\nRotorcraft\nRotorcraft, or rotary-wing aircraft, use a spinning rotor with aerofoil cross-section blades (a rotary wing) to provide lift. Types include helicopters, autogyros, and various hybrids such as gyrodynes and compound rotorcraft.\nHelicopters have a rotor turned by an engine-driven shaft. The rotor pushes air downward to create lift. By tilting the rotor forward, the downward flow is tilted backward, producing thrust for forward flight. Some helicopters have more than one rotor and a few have rotors turned by gas jets at the tips. Some have a tail rotor to counteract the rotation of the main rotor, and to aid directional control.\nAutogyros have unpowered rotors, with a separate power plant to provide thrust. The rotor is tilted backward. As the autogyro moves forward, air blows upward across the rotor, making it spin. This spinning increases the speed of airflow over the rotor, to provide lift. Rotor kites are unpowered autogyros, which are towed to give them forward speed or tethered to a static anchor in high-wind for kited flight.\nCompound rotorcraft have wings that provide some or all of the lift in forward flight. They are nowadays classified as powered lift types and not as rotorcraft. Tiltrotor aircraft (such as the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey), tiltwing, tail-sitter, and coleopter aircraft have their rotors\/propellers horizontal for vertical flight and vertical for forward flight.\n\nOther methods of lift\nA lifting body is an aircraft body shaped to produce lift. If there are any wings, they are too small to provide significant lift and are used only for stability and control. Lifting bodies are not efficient: they suffer from high drag, and must also travel at high speed to generate enough lift to fly. Many of the research prototypes, such as the Martin Marietta X-24, which led up to the Space Shuttle, were lifting bodies, though the Space Shuttle is not, and some supersonic missiles obtain lift from the airflow over a tubular body.\nPowered lift types rely on engine-derived lift for vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL). Most types transition to fixed-wing lift for horizontal flight. Classes of powered lift types include VTOL jet aircraft (such as the Harrier jump jet) and tiltrotors, such as the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey, among others. A few experimental designs rely entirely on engine thrust to provide lift throughout the whole flight, including personal fan-lift hover platforms and jetpacks. VTOL research designs include the Rolls-Royce Thrust Measuring Rig.\nSome rotor wings employ horizontal-axis wings, in which airflow across a spinning rotor generates lift. The Flettner airplane uses a rotating cylinder, obtaining lift from the Magnus effect. The FanWing uses a cross-flow fan, while the mechanically more complex cyclogyro comprises multiple wings which rotate together around a central axis.\nThe ornithopter obtains thrust by flapping its wings.\n\nSize and speed extremes\nSize\nThe smallest aircraft are toys\/recreational items, and nano aircraft.\nThe largest aircraft by dimensions and volume (as of 2016) is the 302 ft (92 m) long British Airlander 10, a hybrid blimp, with helicopter and fixed-wing features, and reportedly capable of speeds up to 90 mph (140 km\/h; 78 kn), and an airborne endurance of two weeks with a payload of up to 22,050 lb (10,000 kg).\nThe largest aircraft by weight and largest regular fixed-wing aircraft ever built, as of 2016, was the Antonov An-225 Mriya. That Soviet-built (Ukrainian SSR) six-engine transport of the 1980s was 84 m (276 ft) long, with an 88 m (289 ft) wingspan. It holds the world payload record, after transporting 428,834 lb (194,516 kg) of goods, and has flown 100 t (220,000 lb) loads commercially. With a maximum loaded weight of 550\u2013700 t (1,210,000\u20131,540,000 lb), it was also the heaviest aircraft built to date. It could cruise at 500 mph (800 km\/h; 430 kn). The aircraft was destroyed during the Russo-Ukrainian War.\nThe largest military airplanes are the Ukrainian Antonov An-124 Ruslan (world's second-largest airplane, also used as a civilian transport), and American Lockheed C-5 Galaxy transport, weighing, loaded, over 380 t (840,000 lb). The 8-engine, piston\/propeller Hughes H-4 Hercules \"Spruce Goose\" \u2014 an American World War II wooden flying boat transport with a greater wingspan (94m\/260ft) than any current aircraft and a tail height equal to the tallest (Airbus A380-800 at 24.1m\/78ft) \u2014 flew only one short hop in the late 1940s and never flew out of ground effect.\nThe largest civilian airplanes, apart from the above-noted An-225 and An-124, are the Airbus Beluga cargo transport derivative of the Airbus A300 jet airliner, the Boeing Dreamlifter cargo transport derivative of the Boeing 747 jet airliner\/transport (the 747-200B was, at its creation in the 1960s, the heaviest aircraft ever built, with a maximum weight of over 400 t (880,000 lb)), and the double-decker Airbus A380 \"super-jumbo\" jet airliner (the world's largest passenger airliner).\n\nSpeeds\nThe fastest fixed-wing aircraft and fastest glider, is the Space Shuttle, which re-entered the atmosphere at nearly Mach 25 or 17,500 mph (28,200 km\/h)\nThe fastest recorded powered aircraft flight and fastest recorded aircraft flight of an air-breathing powered aircraft was of the NASA X-43A Pegasus, a scramjet-powered, hypersonic, lifting body experimental research aircraft, at Mach 9.68 or 6,755 mph (10,870 km\/h) on 16 November 2004.\nPrior to the X-43A, the fastest recorded powered airplane flight, and still the record for the fastest manned powered airplane, was the North American X-15, rocket-powered airplane at Mach 6.7 or 7,274 km\/h (4,520 mph) on 3 October 1967.\nThe fastest manned, air-breathing powered airplane is the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird, a U.S. reconnaissance jet fixed-wing aircraft, having reached 3,530 km\/h (2,193 mph) on 28 July 1976.\n\nPropulsion\nUnpowered aircraft\nGliders are heavier-than-air aircraft that do not employ propulsion once airborne. Take-off may be by launching forward and downward from a high location, or by pulling into the air on a tow-line, either by a ground-based winch or vehicle, or by a powered \"tug\" aircraft. For a glider to maintain its forward air speed and lift, it must descend in relation to the air (but not necessarily in relation to the ground). Many gliders can \"soar\", i.e., gain height from updrafts such as thermal currents. The first practical, controllable example was designed and built by the British scientist and pioneer George Cayley, whom many recognise as the first aeronautical engineer. Common examples of gliders are sailplanes, hang gliders and paragliders.\nBalloons drift with the wind, though normally the pilot can control the altitude, either by heating the air or by releasing ballast, giving some directional control (since the wind direction changes with altitude). A wing-shaped hybrid balloon can glide directionally when rising or falling; but a spherically shaped balloon does not have such directional control.\nKites are aircraft that are tethered to the ground or other object (fixed or mobile) that maintains tension in the tether or kite line; they rely on virtual or real wind blowing over and under them to generate lift and drag. Kytoons are balloon-kite hybrids that are shaped and tethered to obtain kiting deflections, and can be lighter-than-air, neutrally buoyant, or heavier-than-air.\n\nPowered aircraft\nPowered aircraft have one or more onboard sources of mechanical power, typically aircraft engines although rubber and manpower have also been used. Most aircraft engines are either lightweight reciprocating engines or gas turbines. Engine fuel is stored in tanks, usually in the wings but larger aircraft also have additional fuel tanks in the fuselage.\n\nPropeller aircraft\nPropeller aircraft use one or more propellers (airscrews) to create thrust in a forward direction. The propeller is usually mounted in front of the power source in tractor configuration but can be mounted behind in pusher configuration. Variations of propeller layout include contra-rotating propellers and ducted fans.\nMany kinds of power plant have been used to drive propellers. Early airships used man power or steam engines. The more practical internal combustion piston engine was used for virtually all fixed-wing aircraft until World War II and is still used in many smaller aircraft. Some types use turbine engines to drive a propeller in the form of a turboprop or propfan. Human-powered flight has been achieved, but has not become a practical means of transport. Unmanned aircraft and models have also used power sources such as electric motors and rubber bands.\n\nJet aircraft\nJet aircraft use airbreathing jet engines, which take in air, burn fuel with it in a combustion chamber, and accelerate the exhaust rearwards to provide thrust.\nDifferent jet engine configurations include the turbojet and turbofan, sometimes with the addition of an afterburner. Those with no rotating turbomachinery include the pulsejet and ramjet. These mechanically simple engines produce no thrust when stationary, so the aircraft must be launched to flying speed using a catapult, like the V-1 flying bomb, or a rocket, for example. Other engine types include the motorjet and the dual-cycle Pratt & Whitney J58.\nCompared to engines using propellers, jet engines can provide much higher thrust, higher speeds and, above about 40,000 ft (12,000 m), greater efficiency. They are also much more fuel-efficient than rockets. As a consequence nearly all large, high-speed or high-altitude aircraft use jet engines.\n\nRotorcraft\nSome rotorcraft, such as helicopters, have a powered rotary wing or rotor, where the rotor disc can be angled slightly forward so that a proportion of its lift is directed forwards. The rotor may, like a propeller, be powered by a variety of methods such as a piston engine or turbine. Experiments have also used jet nozzles at the rotor blade tips.\n\nOther types of powered aircraft\nRocket-powered aircraft have occasionally been experimented with, and the Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet fighter even saw action in the Second World War. Since then, they have been restricted to research aircraft, such as the North American X-15, which traveled up into space where air-breathing engines cannot work (rockets carry their own oxidant). Rockets have more often been used as a supplement to the main power plant, typically for the rocket-assisted take off of heavily loaded aircraft, but also to provide high-speed dash capability in some hybrid designs such as the Saunders-Roe SR.53.\nThe ornithopter obtains thrust by flapping its wings.\n\nDesign and construction\nAircraft are designed according to many factors such as customer and manufacturer demand, safety protocols and physical and economic constraints. For many types of aircraft the design process is regulated by national airworthiness authorities.\nThe key parts of an aircraft are generally divided into three categories:\n\nThe structure (\"airframe\") comprises the main load-bearing elements and associated equipment, as well as flight controls.\nThe propulsion system (\"powerplant\") (if it is powered) comprises the power source and associated equipment, as described above.\nThe avionics comprise the electrical and electronic control, navigation and communication systems.\n\nStructure\nThe approach to structural design varies widely between different types of aircraft. Some, such as paragliders, comprise only flexible materials that act in tension and rely on aerodynamic pressure to hold their shape. A balloon similarly relies on internal gas pressure, but may have a rigid basket or gondola slung below it to carry its payload. Early aircraft, including airships, often employed flexible doped aircraft fabric covering to give a reasonably smooth aeroshell stretched over a rigid frame. Later aircraft employed semi-monocoque techniques, where the skin of the aircraft is stiff enough to share much of the flight loads. In a true monocoque design there is no internal structure left.\nThe key structural parts of an aircraft depend on what type it is.\n\nAerostats\nLighter-than-air types are characterised by one or more gasbags, typically with a supporting structure of flexible cables or a rigid framework called its hull. Other elements such as engines or a gondola may also be attached to the supporting structure.\n\nAerodynes\nHeavier-than-air types are characterised by one or more wings and a central fuselage. The fuselage typically also carries a tail or empennage for stability and control, and an undercarriage for takeoff and landing. Engines may be located on the fuselage or wings. On a fixed-wing aircraft the wings are rigidly attached to the fuselage, while on a rotorcraft the wings are attached to a rotating vertical shaft. Smaller designs sometimes use flexible materials for part or all of the structure, held in place either by a rigid frame or by air pressure. The fixed parts of the structure comprise the airframe.\n\nPower\nThe source of motive power for an aircraft is normally called the powerplant, and includes engine or motor, propeller or rotor, (if any), jet nozzles and thrust reversers (if any), and accessories essential to the functioning of the engine or motor (e.g.: starter, ignition system, intake system, exhaust system, fuel system, lubrication system, engine cooling system, and engine controls).\nPowered aircraft are typically powered by internal combustion engines (piston or turbine) burning fossil fuels -- typically gasoline (avgas) or jet fuel. A very few are powered by rocket power, ramjet propulsion, or by electric motors, or by internal combustion engines of other types, or using other fuels. A very few have been powered, for short flights, by human muscle energy (e.g.: Gossamer Condor).\n\nAvionics\nThe avionics comprise any electronic aircraft flight control systems and related equipment, including electronic cockpit instrumentation, navigation, radar, monitoring, and communications systems.\n\nFlight characteristics\nFlight envelope\nThe flight envelope of an aircraft refers to its approved design capabilities in terms of airspeed, load factor and altitude. The term can also refer to other assessments of aircraft performance such as maneuverability. When an aircraft is abused, for instance by diving it at too-high a speed, it is said to be flown outside the envelope, something considered foolhardy since it has been taken beyond the design limits which have been established by the manufacturer. Going beyond the envelope may have a known outcome such as flutter or entry to a non-recoverable spin (possible reasons for the boundary).\n\nRange\nThe range is the distance an aircraft can fly between takeoff and landing, as limited by the time it can remain airborne.\nFor a powered aircraft the time limit is determined by the fuel load and rate of consumption.\nFor an unpowered aircraft, the maximum flight time is limited by factors such as weather conditions and pilot endurance. Many aircraft types are restricted to daylight hours, while balloons are limited by their supply of lifting gas. The range can be seen as the average ground speed multiplied by the maximum time in the air.\nThe Airbus A350-900ULR is among the longest range airliners.\n\nFlight dynamics\nFlight dynamics is the science of air vehicle orientation and control in three dimensions. The three critical flight dynamics parameters are the angles of rotation around three axes which pass through the vehicle's center of gravity, known as pitch, roll, and yaw.\n\nRoll is a rotation about the longitudinal axis (equivalent to the rolling or heeling of a ship) giving an up-down movement of the wing tips measured by the roll or bank angle.\nPitch is a rotation about the sideways horizontal axis giving an up-down movement of the aircraft nose measured by the angle of attack.\nYaw is a rotation about the vertical axis giving a side-to-side movement of the nose known as sideslip.\nFlight dynamics is concerned with the stability and control of an aircraft's rotation about each of these axes.\n\nStability\nAn aircraft that is unstable tends to diverge from its intended flight path and so is difficult to fly. A very stable aircraft tends to stay on its flight path and is difficult to maneuver. Therefore, it is important for any design to achieve the desired degree of stability. Since the widespread use of digital computers, it is increasingly common for designs to be inherently unstable and rely on computerised control systems to provide artificial stability.\nA fixed wing is typically unstable in pitch, roll, and yaw. Pitch and yaw stabilities of conventional fixed wing designs require horizontal and vertical stabilisers, which act similarly to the feathers on an arrow. These stabilizing surfaces allow equilibrium of aerodynamic forces and to stabilise the flight dynamics of pitch and yaw. They are usually mounted on the tail section (empennage), although in the canard layout, the main aft wing replaces the canard foreplane as pitch stabilizer. Tandem wing and tailless aircraft rely on the same general rule to achieve stability, the aft surface being the stabilising one.\nA rotary wing is typically unstable in yaw, requiring a vertical stabiliser.\nA balloon is typically very stable in pitch and roll due to the way the payload is slung underneath the center of lift.\n\nControl\nFlight control surfaces enable the pilot to control an aircraft's flight attitude and are usually part of the wing or mounted on, or integral with, the associated stabilizing surface. Their development was a critical advance in the history of aircraft, which had until that point been uncontrollable in flight.\nAerospace engineers develop control systems for a vehicle's orientation (attitude) about its center of mass. The control systems include actuators, which exert forces in various directions, and generate rotational forces or moments about the aerodynamic center of the aircraft, and thus rotate the aircraft in pitch, roll, or yaw. For example, a pitching moment is a vertical force applied at a distance forward or aft from the aerodynamic center of the aircraft, causing the aircraft to pitch up or down. Control systems are also sometimes used to increase or decrease drag, for example to slow the aircraft to a safe speed for landing.\nThe two main aerodynamic forces acting on any aircraft are lift supporting it in the air and drag opposing its motion. Control surfaces or other techniques may also be used to affect these forces directly, without inducing any rotation.\n\nEnvironmental impact\nAircraft permit long distance, high speed travel and may be a more fuel efficient mode of transportation in some circumstances. Aircraft have environmental and climate impacts beyond fuel efficiency considerations, however. They are also relatively noisy compared to other forms of travel and high altitude aircraft generate contrails, which experimental evidence suggests may alter weather patterns.\n\nUses for aircraft\nAircraft are produced in several different types optimized for various uses; military aircraft, which includes not just combat types but many types of supporting aircraft, and civil aircraft, which include all non-military types, experimental and model.\n\nMilitary\nA military aircraft is any aircraft that is operated by a legal or insurrectionary armed service of any type. Military aircraft can be either combat or non-combat:\n\nCombat aircraft are aircraft designed to destroy enemy equipment using its own armament. Combat aircraft divide broadly into fighters and bombers, with several in-between types, such as fighter-bombers and attack aircraft, including attack helicopters.\nNon-combat aircraft are not designed for combat as their primary function, but may carry weapons for self-defense. Non-combat roles include search and rescue, reconnaissance, observation, transport, training, and aerial refueling. These aircraft are often variants of civil aircraft.\nMost military aircraft are powered heavier-than-air types. Other types, such as gliders and balloons, have also been used as military aircraft; for example, balloons were used for observation during the American Civil War and World War I, and military gliders were used during World War II to land troops.\n\nCivil\nCivil aircraft divide into commercial and general types, however there are some overlaps.\nCommercial aircraft include types designed for scheduled and charter airline flights, carrying passengers, mail and other cargo. The larger passenger-carrying types are the airliners, the largest of which are wide-body aircraft. Some of the smaller types are also used in general aviation, and some of the larger types are used as VIP aircraft.\nGeneral aviation is a catch-all covering other kinds of private (where the pilot is not paid for time or expenses) and commercial use, and involving a wide range of aircraft types such as business jets (bizjets), trainers, homebuilt, gliders, warbirds and hot air balloons to name a few. The vast majority of aircraft today are general aviation types.\n\nExperimental\nAn experimental aircraft is one that has not been fully proven in flight, or that carries a Special Airworthiness Certificate, called an Experimental Certificate in United States parlance. This often implies that the aircraft is testing new aerospace technologies, though the term also refers to amateur-built and kit-built aircraft, many of which are based on proven designs.\n\nModel\nA model aircraft is a small unmanned type made to fly for fun, for static display, for aerodynamic research or for other purposes. A scale model is a replica of some larger design.\n\nSee also\nLists\nEarly flying machines\nFlight altitude record\nList of aircraft\nList of civil aircraft\nList of fighter aircraft\nList of individual aircraft\nList of large aircraft\nList of aviation, aerospace and aeronautical terms\n\nTopics\nAircraft hijacking\nAircraft spotting\nAir traffic control\nAirport\nFlying car\nPersonal air vehicle\nPowered parachute\nSpacecraft\nSpaceplane\n\nReferences\nGunston, Bill (1987).

All three were originally American type C3 merchant ships in the process of being built at the Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Company Chester, Pennsylvania. The ships laid down in 1939 and 1940 were launched and delivered to the Royal Navy by 1942 under the Lend-Lease agreement.\nThe ships had a complement of 555 men and an overall length of 492.25 feet (150.04 m), a beam of 66.25 feet (20.19 m) and a height of 23.25 ft (7.09 m). Their displacement was 8,200 long tons (8,332 t) at normal load and 9,000 long tons (9,144 t) at deep load. Propulsion was provided by four diesel engines connected to one shaft giving 8,500 brake horsepower (6,300 kW), which could propel the ships at 16.5 knots (30.6 km\/h; 19.0 mph).\nAircraft facilities were a small combined bridge\u2013flight control on the starboard side and above the 410 feet (120 m) long wooden flight deck, one aircraft lift 43 by 34 feet (13 m \u00d7 10 m), one aircraft catapult and nine arrestor wires. Aircraft could be housed in the 190 by 47 feet (58 m \u00d7 14 m) half hangar below the flight deck. Armament comprised three single mounted 4-inch dual purpose anti-aircraft guns and fifteen 20 mm cannons on single or twin mounts. They had the capacity for fifteen aircraft which would typically be a mixture of Grumman Martlet or Hawker Sea Hurricane fighter aircraft and Fairey Swordfish or Grumman Avenger anti-submarine aircraft. The three ships in the class were HMS Avenger, HMS Biter and HMS Dasher. A fourth ship, USS Charger was built at the same time to the same design but was commissioned in the U.S. Navy.\n\nService history\nHMS Avenger\nHMS Biter\nHMS Dasher\nUSS Charger (CVE-30)\nSee also\nList of ship classes of the Second World War\n\nNotes\nReferences\nCocker, Maurice (2008).

The ships have the hull designator MCM.\nThe Avenger-class ships are being replaced by the Freedom and Independence-class littoral combat ships, as well as other MCM platforms, which use various unmanned air, surface, and undersea vehicles to detect and destroy naval mines at a standoff distance.\n\nHistory\nBackground\nIn the early 1980s, the U.S. Navy began development of a new mine countermeasures (MCM) force, which included two new classes of ships and minesweeping helicopters. The vital importance of a state-of-the-art mine countermeasures force was strongly underscored in the Persian Gulf during the eight years of the Iran\u2013Iraq War, and in Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm in 1990 and 1991 when Avenger and Guardian conducted MCM operations.\nAvenger-class ships are designed as mine hunter-killers capable of finding, classifying, and destroying moored and bottom mines. The last three MCM ships were purchased in 1990, bringing the total to 14 fully deployable, oceangoing Avenger-class ships. These ships use sonar and video systems, cable cutters and a mine-detonating device that can be released and detonated by remote control. They are also capable of conventional sweeping measures.\n\nOperations\nAs of 2012, eight Avengers were forward-based: four at Sasebo, Japan with standing crews, and four at Manama, Bahrain, with ten ships' companies on rotational deployments. In March 2012, the USN announced plans to deploy another four MCMs to Bahrain to counter potential Iranian threats to mine the Strait of Hormuz reflecting increasing tensions between the United States and Iran over the latter's nuclear program.\n\nDesign\nHull\nThe hulls of the Avenger-class ships are constructed of wood with an external coating of fiberglass. The wood used is oak, Douglas fir and Nootka Cypress because of their flexibility, strength and low weight. This construction allows the hull to withstand a nearby blast from a mine, and also gives the ship a low magnetic signature.\n\nMine countermeasures systems\nThe ships use AN\/SLQ-48 remotely operated mine disposal system supplied by Alliant Techsystems (ATK) and the EX116 Mod 0 remotely operated vehicle (ROV) mine neutralization system supplied by ATK and Raytheon. The AN\/SLQ-48 detects, locates, classifies, and neutralizes moored mines and mines resting on the seabed. The vehicle uses high-frequency, high-resolution sonar, low light level television (LLLTV), cable cutters, and explosive charges to detect and dispose of mines, while remaining tethered to the vessel by a 3,510-foot (1,070 m) cable and under control of the vessel.\nThe ATK\/Raytheon ROV is a similar system, but has a 4,900-foot (1,500 m) tether cable, and also carries cable cutters for dealing with tethered or moored mines, and explosive charges to detonate the mines.\n\nSensor systems\nThe ships employ the AN\/SQQ-32 advanced minehunting and classification sonar from Raytheon and Thales Underwater Systems (formerly Thomson Marconi Sonar). The system has two sonars fitted in a small submersible pod towed under the ship. When not deployed the submersible is housed in a trunk below the deck of the ship. The sonars are a Raytheon search and detection sonar and a Thales high-resolution, high-frequency, target-classification sonar. The deployment and retrieval system for the submersible was designed by the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory in Massachusetts.\nThe Avenger class employ the AN\/SPS-55 surface-search and navigation radar supplied by Cardion, Inc. of New York. The ships have been equipped with CMC Electronics LN66 or Raytheon AN\/SPS-66 navigation radars, but are slated to be upgraded with the AN\/SPS-73.\n\nPropulsion\nThe Avenger-class ships are equipped with four Waukesha-Pearce diesel engines (MCM 1 and 2) or Isotta-Fraschini ID 36SS6V diesel engines (remainder), which are designed to have very low magnetic and acoustic signatures. Each engine develops 600 horsepower (450 kW), with a combined power of 2,400 horsepower (1.8 MW), providing a cruising speed of 14 knots (26 km\/h; 16 mph) with controllable pitch propellers. For stationkeeping the ship uses two Hansome electric motors rated at 394 horsepower (294 kW). Precision maneuvering capability is provided by a 345 horsepower (257 kW) Omnithruster hydrojet (powered by Solar (Caterpillar Inc) Magnetic Marine Gas Turbine Generator).\n\nShips\nAppearances in popular culture\nA fictional Avenger Class MCM is the vessel at the center of the 2023 film The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial.

Associated with the new wave of British heavy metal scene, they released two albums in the 1980s before splitting up. The band reunited in 2005.\n\nHistory\nBrian Ross, Mick Moore and Gary Young founded Avenger late in 1982 after Ross and Moore's previous group, Blitzkrieg, split up. The group began recording demos. \"Hot 'n' Heavy Express\", was their first appearance on record, included on a Neat Records compilation EP. Their debut single for Neat, \"Too Wild to Tame\", followed in October 1983 after the addition of guitarist John Brownless.\nShortly after this, lead singer Brian Ross left the group to join Satan; Satan's singer, Ian Swift, promptly joined Avenger as lead vocalist. Adding guitarist Les Cheetham, they released their first LP, Blood Sports, in 1984. This began a period of the band playing regularly in western Europe, at the time a hub of the emerging metal scene.\nA second album followed shortly after on Neat, entitled Killer Elite, along with a three track accompanying video. The group toured the United States in 1986, replacing Les Cheetam with Greg Reiter. Drumming duty of the US tour fell to Darren Kurland. After four months, returning to England, the group broke up, blaming poor record label support preventing the band exploiting their potential in the United States. Ian Swift joined Atomkraft with Gary Young later joining Blitzkrieg.\nThe group's entire discography was released in 2002 by Sanctuary Records. As well as Brazilian Label Frontline Rock rereleasing both albums in Latin America in 2003.\nIn February 2005, the core lineup of Young, Swift and Moore reunited and added north-east session musician, Liam Thompson (formerly guitar\/vocals of Death in Blood) and guitarist Glenn Howes (formerly Blitzkrieg, Tygers of Pan Tang, Earthrod and Fist) and toured across the UK and Europe with US group Y&T, among others.\nThe Avenger line-up changed again in 2007 with the departure of original bassist Mick Moore. The new line-up of Avenger featuring Ian Swift on vocals, Gary Young, Liam Thompson, Sean Jefferies (former guitarist of Fallen Skies, Earthrod) and Huw Holding (former bassist of Order of the Black Sun, Nord, Cardinal Synne) and have since toured with or played alongside bands such as Twisted Sister, Candlemass, Saxon, Rage, Raven, Sinner, Grim Reaper, UFO, Cradle of Filth, Skyclad and Diamond Head in 2007.\nTheir most recent album, The Slaughter Never Stops, was released 1 December 2014 to positive reviews.\n\nMembers\nDiscography\nOne Take No Dubs... \u2013 Live in the studio (Neat Records compilation, 1982)\n\"Too Wild to Tame\" \/ \"On the Rocks\" 7\" (Neat Records, 1983)\nBlood Sports (Neat Records, 1984)\nKiller Elite (Neat Records, 1985)\nToo Wild to Tame (Sanctuary Records compilation, 2002)\nThe Slaughter Never Stops (Rocksector Records, 2014)\n\nSee also\nList of new wave of British heavy metal bands\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nOfficial Myspace page\nOfficial Reverbnation page\nOfficial YouTube channel","15":"A character class is a fundamental part of the identity and nature of characters in the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game. A character's capabilities, strengths, and weaknesses are largely defined by their class; choosing a class is one of the first steps a player takes to create a Dungeons & Dragons player character. A character's class affects a character's available skills and abilities. A well-rounded party of characters requires a variety of abilities offered by the classes found within the game.\nDungeons & Dragons was the first game to introduce the usage of character classes to role-playing. Many other traditional role-playing games and massively multiplayer online role-playing games have since adopted the concept as well. Dungeons & Dragons classes have generally been defined in the Player's Handbook, one of the three core rulebooks; a variety of alternate classes have also been defined in supplemental sourcebooks.\n\nClasses by type\nPrincipal base classes\nThese base classes have appeared as character classes in the core rulebooks of multiple editions of Dungeons & Dragons:\n\nAlternative base classes\nWhile the main character classes available have remained fairly consistent since the 1st edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, a variety of alternate base classes have been offered in supplemental books. The release of Unearthed Arcana in 1985, for instance, introduced the base class of Barbarian and reworked Paladins to be a type of the new base class \"Cavalier\". Oriental Adventures also introduced a number of alternate classes more appropriate for an Eastern setting. The 2nd edition added several completely new base classes (e.g. Runecaster and Shaman); in addition, supplemental handbooks offered a variety of \"kits\" to customize each base class, and the Dungeon Master's Guide offered rules for creating new character classes. The 3rd edition introduced five classes for use in creating non-player characters in its Dungeon Master's Guide.\nNon-core base classes are considered optional and do not always exist in all settings. For example, the Samurai class introduced in the Oriental Adventures book may not make sense in a game set in a standard European-style realm. Similarly, classes associated with psionics such as the Psychic Warrior do not apply to worlds without psionics.\n\nMulticlassing\nMost editions of Dungeons & Dragons have allowed for the possibility to either advance in more than one class simultaneously, alternately taking levels in more than one class, or branching out in a second (or more) class at a specific point defined by the first class, a concept generally called \"multiclassing\".:\u200a82\u201384\u200a\nIn the 1st and 2nd editions, changing a character's class is difficult. Only those playing as humans can, and it requires extremely high stats to do so. This is called \"dual-classing\". Non-humans, on the other hand, can \"multiclass\" where they effectively learn two (and rarely even three) classes at the same time at the cost of slower level progression for that character.:\u200a82\u201384\u200a\nThe 3rd edition allows players to mix and match levels from any number of classes, though certain combinations are more effective than others. In addition, Prestige classes add more options for multiclassing.:\u200a82\u201384\u200a This edition offers the most freedom regarding multiclassing. There are, however, penalties to the rate of experience point gained if classes are added haphazardly. The 3rd edition version of Unearthed Arcana includes rules for gestalt characters which combine the advantages of two classes.\nThe 4th edition allows characters to take a feat that grants access to specific facets of another class. The class-specific multiclass feats are also prerequisites for the power-swap feats, each of which allows the character to swap out a daily, encounter, or utility power from their first class for one from their second class. Also, at level 11, a character with a multiclass feat and all of the power-swap feats is eligible for paragon multiclassing, which allows them to gain additional powers from their second class in lieu of taking a Paragon Path. Some classes are only available through multiclassing; the first such class was Spellscarred, introduced in the Forgotten Realms Player's Guide. In the 4th Edition, each character can only multiclass into a single class, unless otherwise stated by their primary class (such as the Bard). The Player's Handbook III introduced \"hybrid\" classes, a deeper form of multiclassing in which elements of two classes are combined each level.\nIn the 5th edition, multiclassing requires minimum ability scores before it can be chosen; however, the requirements are not as steep as in previous editions. The core classes only require an ability score of 13 or greater in the specific requisite score, except for the Monk, Paladin and Ranger (who need 13s in two stats).\n\nClasses by editions\nOriginal D&D\nIn the original Dungeons & Dragons boxed set, there were only three main classes: the Cleric, the Fighting man, and the Magic-User. The first supplement, Greyhawk, added the Thief as a fourth main class, as well as the Paladin as a Fighting Man subclass. These four fantasy gaming archetypes represent four major tactical roles in play: the Fighter offers direct combat strength and durability; the Thief offers cunning and stealth; the Cleric provides support in both combat and magic; and the Magic-User has a variety of magical powers. In many ways, other classes are thought of as alternatives that refine or combine these functions. \nEach of the playable races had different amounts of access to the classes.  Dwarves could be Fighters or Fighter\/Thieves, with Fighter\/Cleric possible for NPCs. Halflings were restricted to the Fighting Man and Thief classes. Elves were restricted to Fighter\/Magic-User, Fighter\/Magic-User\/Thief, and Thief class options, with Fighter\/Magic-User\/Cleric an option for elven NPCs. Half-Elves (introduced in Greyhawk) could be Fighter\/Magic-Users, Fighter\/Magic-User\/Clerics, or Thieves. All four non-human races had limited level advancement except in the Thief class. Humans could be any single class with no level restriction.\n\nAD&D 1st edition\nAdvanced Dungeons & Dragons loosened the restrictions on race and class combinations, although non-human races often had restricted choices among classes and maximum levels they could reach in a class. Additional classes that had first appeared in supplements and articles in The Strategic Review magazine were included as base classes. The Player's Handbook also introduced the bard as a sixth base class; however, its usage in 1st edition was more akin to what would be called a prestige class in later editions, as it was not a legal choice for a starting character. Instead, a character had to start as a fighter, change classes to a thief, and finally switch classes once more to become a bard.\nA character's ability scores directly tied into what class choices were legal for them. For instance, a character wishing to be a fighter required at least 9 strength; the more discriminating monk required 15 strength, 15 wisdom, 15 dexterity, and 11 constitution. Unusually high or low ability scores could proscribe class choice further; \"too high\" an intelligence could prohibit being a fighter, while a charisma of 5 or less would require the character to become an assassin. High ability scores in statistics considered pertinent to the class would grant an experience bonus.\nThe Player's Handbook brought about other changes in the game and its character classes. Fighters, clerics, and thieves have increased hit dice compared to the original edition. The book also made changes to how the strength score of a character affects their chances to hit in combat and cause damage, as well as how much weight they can carry, and the roll to open doors successfully. A higher intelligence score grants an increased chance for both knowledge of spells and ability to learn languages. A higher wisdom score now granted clerics a bonus to their spells, while low wisdom imposed a possibility that their spells will fail. New charts detail the effects of the constitution, dexterity, and charisma scores for characters. Each of the five main character classes and five sub-classes had its own table for charting gains on experience points; for most of these classes it now required more experience points than before to reach beyond third or fourth levels. The book also introduced multiclassed characters to the game.\nUnearthed Arcana added the Cavalier, Barbarian, and Thief-Acrobat classes.\n\nD&D Basic Set\nThe second version of the Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set combined the idea of race and class; non-human races did not have classes. Hence, a character might be a (human) Cleric or else simply an \"Elf\" or \"Dwarf\". The Basic Set presented four human classes: Cleric, Fighter, Magic User, and Thief, and three demi-human classes: Dwarf, Elf, and Halfling. The Companion Set introduced four optional classes for high-level characters: the Avenger, Paladin, and Knight for Fighters, and the Druid for Clerics.  The Master Set introduced one additional class: the Mystic. The Rules Cyclopedia included in its final pages instructions on modifying the Halfling class into a Gnome class, adding that as an option. The Gazetteer series included many optional classes for humans and non-humans, including the shaman (GAZ12) and shamani (GAZ14). Additional human and race classes were also presented in other supplements.\n\nAD&D 2nd edition\nThe 2nd edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons attempted to streamline what had become a hodgepodge of rules that only applied in specific cases in 1st edition. As such, it sought to simplify the rules and straighten out contradictions. Character classes were divided into four groups or \"metaclasses\": Warrior, Wizard, Priest, and Rogue. Each of these groups had a \"base\" class which only required at least a 9 in the \"prime requisite\" ability in Fighter, Mage, Cleric, and Thief; these were intended to be playable in any setting. The Player's Handbook went on to say that \"all of the other classes are optional\". Each group of classes had the same hit dice (determining hit point growth), THAC0 progression, and saving throw table. 2nd edition maintained minimums in certain statistics to qualify for some classes, but removed many of the other restrictions such as one extremely low ability forcing a character into a specific class.\nThe bard class was changed to be a normal class that could be chosen at character creation. The assassin and monk classes were removed from the 2nd edition Player's Handbook.:\u200a84\u200a The Dungeon Master's Guide clarified the rationale behind the decision in a section on creating new character classes:\n\nWhat is a Viking but a fighter with a certain outlook on life and warfare? A witch is really nothing but a female wizard. A vampire hunter is only a title assumed by a character of any class who is dedicated to the destruction and elimination of those loathsome creatures.\n\nThe same is true of assassins. Killing for profit requires no special powers, only a specific reprehensible outlook. Choosing the title does not imply any special powers or abilities. The character just uses his current skills to fulfill a specific, personal set of goals.\nSupplemental books introduced new classes. The barbarian returned as a class in the Complete Barbarian's Handbook which also introduced the shaman. The berserker and the runecaster classes appeared in the Viking's Campaign Sourcebook, and the manteis in the Celts Campaign Sourcebook. The psionicist class was introduced in the Complete Psionics Handbook. Campaign settings also introduced new classes, such as the magician and guilder from Birthright, the gladiator and trader from Dark Sun, and the anchorite and arcanist from Ravenloft.\n\nKits and specialisations\nClass-specific supplements for 2nd edition introduced a number of additional class modifications called kits, which allowed players to create characters with particular themes without having to introduce additional classes. The assassin, barbarian, and monk were re-implemented in such fashion (although some kits were expanded to full classes in supplements).\nThe 2nd edition had two unified spell groups, one for wizard spells and another for priest spells. These lists were then further subdivided by school of magic and sphere of influence, respectively. Different classes had access to different schools or spheres, allowing for each class to have distinct spell lists. The illusionist class from 1st edition, for example, became a type of specialist wizard; specialists gained the ability to cast extra spells of their chosen school of magic in exchange for the inability to cast spells of \"opposed\" schools; an illusionist would gain extra spells per day in the school of illusion, but would be denied access to the schools of abjuration, necromancy, and evocation. \nA similar distinction was made for priests. 2nd edition introduced priests of a specific mythology who would gain their own specific abilities, restrictions, and sphere of influence selection. The druid was provided as an example; the specification of other speciality priests was left to dungeon masters and setting books. As an example, a specialty priest of Tempus, the god of war in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, can incite a berserker rage in allies and lacks the \"only blunt weapons\" restriction of normal clerics. The selection of spheres of influence worked similarly to the allowed and forbidden schools of magic.\n\nD&D 3rd edition\nThe 3rd edition abolished the practice of grouping classes directly, allowing hit dice, attack bonus, and saving throws to vary for each particular class again. 3rd edition also saw the return of the Monk as a base class, the creation of the new Sorcerer class, and the inclusion of Barbarian as a base Player's Handbook class, previously described in 1st edition's Unearthed Arcana rules and as an optional kit in 2nd edition. Ability requirements on classes and experience bonuses were abolished, though a low score in an ability that is important to a class would still adversely affect a character in it.\n3rd edition allows for a much more fluid idea of multiclassing than earlier editions, as one unified experience-points-per-level table was made. Rather than earlier editions' rules on splitting experience, characters can simply choose which class they wish to take a new level in and add the appropriate bonus from the class.\nPrestige classes were also introduced in the 3rd edition's Dungeon Master's Guide, with new classes only available at higher levels and after meeting several prerequisites.\nIn addition to the eleven classes presented in the PHB, various alternate base classes were presented in supplements, and the Dungeon Master's Guide presented five weaker classes designed for NPCs (the adept, aristocrat, commoner, expert, and warrior). Low-level humanoid monsters, such as goblins, have levels in an NPC class instead of racial hit dice.\nIn addition to class variants for the eleven core classes, many of the supplemental books introduce new base classes that can be taken from first level or multiclassed into, such as the Warlock from Complete Arcane. Some of these books also present prestige classes which have entry requirements only accessible by taking levels in the base classes described in those books (e.g. the Soulcaster prestige class requires the soulmelding class ability, only offered by the three classes in Magic of Incarnum).\n\nPrestige classes\nPrestige classes were introduced in 3rd edition as a further means of individualizing a character.:\u200a64\u200a They expand upon the form of multiclassing and are inaccessible at first level, specifically meant to be multiclassed into from the base classes. To attain a specific prestige class, a character must first meet a number of prerequisites, such as certain feats or membership in a specific organization. Prestige classes offer a focus on different abilities that may be difficult to attain otherwise; for example, the 3rd edition version of the Assassin prestige class grants minor magical powers, more sneak attack damage, and better usage of poison.\nThe 3rd edition Dungeon Master's Guide included prestige classes such as the Arcane Archer, Blackguard, Mystic Theurge, and Shadowdancer, while the 3.5 revision additionally included classes such as the Arcane Trickster, Archmage, Dragon Disciple, and Duelist. Many other sourcebooks introduced additional prestige classes, such as the Bladesinger in Tome and Blood; Blighter, Geomancer, Shifter, Verdant Lord in Masters of the Wild; Divine Champion in Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting; Cerebremancer and Elocater in Expanded Psionics Handbook; Fochlucan Lyrist in Complete Adventurer; and Chameleon in Races of Destiny. Some of these classes were readjusted for balance in the 3.5 revision of the game.\n\nD&D 4th edition\nThe 4th edition heavily retooled the class system in favor of a more unified set of mechanics for characters, which was in part intended to reduce some of the perceived imbalance between spellcasters and non-spellcasters in the 3rd edition. Classes can be defined as the combination of a character role with a power source and are differentiated by what active-use class features and powers they give, all of which follow the same pattern of at-will, once per encounter, once daily, and utility powers.\nThe 4th edition Player's Handbook does not include some classes from 3rd edition, such as the Barbarian, Bard, Druid, Monk, and Sorcerer (though these classes returned in the second and third volumes of the Player's Handbook), but does include the Warlock (originally introduced in the 3.5 edition sourcebook Complete Arcane) and Warlord (originally introduced as the Marshal in the 3rd edition Miniatures Handbook) which had not appeared in the Player's Handbook in previous editions. Twenty-six classes were released in total.\nDifferent classes draw on different power sources for their abilities. The power sources used by the Player's Handbook classes are arcane, divine, and martial. Arcane classes gain magical energy from the cosmos, divine classes receive their power from the gods, and martial classes draw power from training and willpower. The Player's Handbook 2 introduces the primal power source, which draws power from the spirits of the natural world and features transformation as a theme. Dragon No. 379 included the Assassin class, introducing the shadow power source. The Player's Handbook 3 introduced the psionic power source, which draws power from the mind. Player's Option: Heroes of the Elemental Chaos introduced builds that use the elemental power source.\nCharacters of a given class are said to fill a particular character role in the party, especially in combat. Leaders are focused on buffing and healing allies. Controllers focus on affecting multiple targets at once, either damaging or debuffing them, or altering the battlefield's terrain. Defenders focus on blocking attacking enemies or drawing their attacks to themselves and are typically focused on melee combat. Strikers are focused on mobility, dealing heavy damage to single targets and avoiding attacks. A character may fill secondary roles depending primarily on their choice of powers; for example, a Fighter may have Controller as a secondary role by choosing powers that subject enemies to forced movement. While some Leader and Striker classes and builds are focused towards either melee or ranged combat, the roles as a whole are not.\n\nParagon paths and epic destinies\nThe optional prestige classes from earlier editions were replaced by paragon paths and epic destinies as methods of character customization. Each character may choose a paragon path upon reaching the paragon tier at level 11 and an epic destiny upon reaching the epic tier at level 21.\nParagon paths are often (though not always) class-specific, and some have additional prerequisites. Other paragon paths are restricted to members of a certain race or are associated with a nation or faction in a campaign setting. Paragon paths generally expand on a character's existing abilities. For example, fighter paragon paths improve a character's toughness, resilience, or damage with melee weapons.\nEpic destinies generally have looser prerequisites than paragon paths; many are available to multiple classes, and some, such as Demigod and Eternal Seeker, have 21st level as their only prerequisite. Each epic destiny includes at least one way in which a character can establish a legacy and at least one way in which a character can retire. Most epic destinies provide fewer benefits than paragon paths, but the benefits that they provide are far more powerful. A common feature of an epic destiny is to allow characters to (usually once per day) return to life or otherwise continue to function after dying.\nUnlike prestige classes, a character may only take a single paragon path and a single epic destiny, and path and destiny advancement is in addition to class advancement rather than being in lieu of it.\n\nD&D 5th edition\nClasses in the 5th edition are mechanically and thematically similar to the versions in the 3rd edition. Classes gain new abilities as they reach each level, allowing them to combat stronger monsters and more difficult perilous situations, but unlike 4th edition, lower-level opponents remain threatening as power levels do not scale in tandem.\nThere are 12 classes included in the 5th edition Player's Handbook (2014). The campaign setting book Eberron: Rising from the Last War (2019) introduced the Artificer as a new class for the edition; it was later revised in the sourcebook Tasha's Cauldron of Everything (2020). The Player's Handbook (2024), as part of the 2024 revision to the 5th Edition ruleset, updates all preexisting classes from the Player's Handbook (2014); it also includes revised versions of some subclasses. In light of the 2024 changes, Player's Handbook (2024) lead designer Jeremy Crawford suggested that \"players familiar with the rules should start their campaigns at 3rd level so they have access to both core class abilities and subclass abilities\" from the start.\n\nSubclasses\nEach class in the Player's Handbook (2014) has multiple subclasses, which allow players to choose an archetype of their class they want to follow (e.g. the Berserker Barbarian, the Evoker Wizard, the Wild Magic Sorcerer, the Beastmaster Ranger, etc.), chosen at 3rd level or earlier. This archetype defines many of the abilities that the class receives. The Dungeon Master's Guide (2014) includes two nonstandard subclass options for evil characters that are only allowed in the game by permission of the Dungeon Master: the Death Cleric and the Oathbreaker Paladin.\nAdditional subclasses have been added to the game with the publication of various sourcebooks and campaign guidebooks, for example, in supplements such as the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide (2015), Xanathar's Guide to Everything (2017) and Tasha's Cauldron of Everything (2020). Some classes from earlier editions were included in 5th edition as subclasses, like assassin, psi warrior, shaman, and war mage. Several other subclasses had appeared in previous editions as kits, prestige classes, or paragon paths; this is especially true of setting-specific classes or ones with unique flavor, like arcane trickster, bladesinger, drunken master, Purple Dragon knight, and Samurai.\nChristian Hoffer of ComicBook.com explained that in the original 5th Edtion ruleset the Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, and Wizard classes gained \"access to their subclass at either 1st or 2nd Level. A large reason for this is how those classes are presented in the lore\" such as the Cleric or Warlock respectively declaring their god or otherworldly patron at the first level. He highlighted that the 2024 update standardizes subclass progression with all classes now picking \"their subclass at 3rd level, along with other shifts as to when players gain subclass features at higher levels\".\n\n^a Renamed from Totem Warrior.\n^b Renamed from Four Elements.\n\nReception\nIn an article comparing the 1978 Player's Handbook and the 2014 Player's Handbook, James Floyd Kelly, for GeekDad, highlighted that the earlier edition had inconsistencies in leveling across the different character classes. Floyd Kelly wrote: \"For all of the classes, the XP chart for leveling varied. Paladins required 350,000XP after level 11, while Fighters only required 250,000XP after the same level. Poor Magic-Users, though\u2026 after level 18 each additional level came at a price of 375,000XP while the Illusionist could rock after level 12 with a requirement of only 220,000XP per additional level. Oh, and the Monk had to stop at level 17. No further advancement\".\nShannon Appelcline, author of Designers & Dragons, highlighted that while OD&D only had three character classes, \"which made it easy to balance a party\", \"as character classes proliferated in later editions, it became less clear which classes could fill which roles\". The 4th Edition classes were designed for specific party roles and these \"classes were unified in how they were defined and how they progressed. [...] The difference in the character classes now focused on what powers they had and what they could do\". Appelcline wrote that the addition of warlock and warlord to the 4th Edition base classes was \"surprising\" and \"with so many new races and classes, it's not surprising that some classics got dropped. The [...] assassin, bard, and druid were all classics that were missing from the class list. This generated even more controversy, and the designers later said that they regretted not saying that the first Player's Handbook was just a starting place for D&D 4E\". In the AV Club's review of the 5th Edition, Samantha Nelson wrote: \"Just like in 4th Edition, there are several versions of each class, which provide a high level of diversity in the party. [...] But the different character classes play far more like 3.5 than 4th Edition. [...] Many of the classes have been radically improved. There isn't a single leveling up where the only benefit is a few more hit points. Each new benchmark unlocks some new component of your class, rewarding your dedication to one path over the course of the game's 20 levels\".\nIn SLUG Magazine's review of the 5th Edition Player's Handbook (2014), Henry Glasheen wrote: \"I didn't feel like any race was unduly pidgeonholed into one class or another [...]. Classes are deeper now, with more meaningful customization options and a more modest progression. Multiclassing is still available, but it seems like the development team has found a way to balance the overpowered multiclassing opportunities of D&D 3.5 while avoiding the convoluted clusterfuck that was multiclassing in 4th Edition. In most cases, you'll want to stick to your starting class, but there are some interesting multiclass builds that I certainly want to try out\". Gus Wezerek, for FiveThirtyEight, reported that of the 5th edition \"class and race combinations per 100,000 characters that players created on D&D Beyond from\" August 15 to September 15, 2017, fighters were the most created at 13,906 total, followed by rogues (11,307) and wizards (9,855). Druids were the least created at 6,328 total. Wezerek wrote \"When I started playing 'Dungeons & Dragons' five years ago, I never would have chosen the game's most popular match: the human fighter. There are already enough human fighters in movies, TV and books \u2014 my first character was an albino dragonborn sorcerer. But these days I can get behind the combo's simplicity\". Screen Rant rated the wizard class as the most powerful class and the ranger class as the least powerful of the base 12 character classes in 5th Edition.\nOn the 2024 5th Edition update to class progression, Christian Hoffer of ComicBook.com thought that \"while subclass standardization might make sense from a rules and balance perspective, it does unfortunately rob some Dungeons & Dragons of some roleplaying flavor. Almost all of the spellcasting classes feel a bit homogenized at lower levels with this change, although assumedly the different spell lists and the 1st and 2nd level abilities can make up some of this difference\". Henry St Leger of GamesRadar+ opined that \"the D&D rules revisions seem to be a net improvement to one of the best tabletop RPGs\", however, he felt some classes lost \"flavorful aspects\" in exchange for \"utility elsewhere\". He stated that \"I'm hugely excited to try each of the revised classes for myself, and inevitably there were going to be losses alongside the many gains in this semi-new edition. But some may find that the things that drew them to a class fantasy in the first place have been sidelined \u2013 and those players may find themselves missing what they've lost\".\n\nIn popular culture\nTelevision\nIn the American science fiction horror television series Stranger Things, a Dungeons and Dragons game played by the main characters is one of the first scenes of the show and the game reappears throughout the show. In 2019, Wizards of the Coast released a 5th Edition Stranger Things-themed starter set that includes \"five pre-generated characters, one each for the five members of the party as described in Stranger Things Season 2. Fans can step into the shoes of Mike's paladin, Will's cleric, Lucas' ranger, Dustin's bard, and Eleven's wizard\".\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nSystem Reference Document: OGL information on D&D classes (for 3rd Edition)\nSystem Reference Document: OGL information on D&D classes (for 5th Edition)","16":"Avenger is a political thriller novel by English writer Frederick Forsyth, published in September 2003. It was adapted for television as the 2006 film Avenger starring Sam Elliott.\n\nPlot summary\nThe first act of the novel introduces Calvin Dexter, the main character of the story.  Dexter is described as a lawyer in his early fifties with a passion for running triathlons to keep in shape.  The book digs into his past and reveals that he is a highly decorated Vietnam War veteran, and that his last tour of duty was as a tunnel rat, an extremely \u00e9lite and secret task force that descended deep into the catacombs of Vietcong tunnels to hunt down the enemy in their own lairs. Dexter later married and had a daughter who at the age of 16 was lured away and forced into prostitution by Latino gang members and eventually murdered. Dexter hunts down his daughter's killers in Panama and executes them, then returns home only to discover that his beloved wife couldn't deal with the death of their only child and has committed suicide during his absence. He moves away and becomes only a small-town lawyer in his public face. But when the reason and price are right, he transforms himself into the \"Avenger\" and delivers justice not by killing criminals but by 'rendering' them to the United States, so that they will stand trial for their crimes against Americans.  Intertwined into the backstory of Calvin Dexter is the narrative of a young American volunteer from a very privileged family who was killed while delivering aid in Bosnia during the Bosnian War.\nAs the second act kicks into gear, the boy's grandfather, Stephen Edmonds, a Canadian billionaire and veteran of the Battle of Britain, hires a tracker to discover the identity of his sole grandson's killer and eventually learns him to be Zoran \u017dili\u0107, a sadistic hitman for Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107's government. The CIA had followed the movements of \u017dili\u0107 during the war, but let him slip off the radar after the fall of Milo\u0161evi\u0107. Edmonds then learns of the services provided by the Avenger and hires him to pursue \u017dili\u0107 and bring him to trial. It is then revealed that a secret section in the CIA, headed by Paul Devereaux III, a dedicated patriot, has been working with \u017dili\u0107 in recent months with plans to use him as bait to eliminate another terrorist danger \u2014 Osama bin Laden himself. From the CIA\u2019s point of view, \u017dili\u0107, despite his horrific crimes, had been marginalised as a result of the end of hostilities in Bosnia and could be used to neutralise a much larger threat to the American way of life.\nThe third act details the actions of the \"Avenger\" as he tracks \u017dili\u0107 to his palatial and fully self-sufficient farm\/compound in South America. Meanwhile, the CIA operatives work furiously to prevent the \"Avenger\" from nabbing \u017dili\u0107. The Avenger is tipped off by an unknown ally that the CIA is onto him and outsmarts them at every turn.  He successfully manages to transport \u017dili\u0107 to Key West and into police custody. It is revealed in the aftermath that the person that tipped Dexter off was an FBI agent, and that his previous Tunnel Rat partner is now Devereaux's deputy. Just as the story ends, the date is stated to be September 10, 2001.\n\n\n== References ==","17":"Avenger is a Star Trek novel by William Shatner (co-written with Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens), depicting the events shortly after the feature film Star Trek Generations and the previous \"Shatnerverse\" novel The Return. It is a direct sequel to the latter, and forms part of the \"Shatnerverse\" collection of novels, being the third novel written by Shatner for the Trek series of novels. It was published in 1997 by Pocket Books.\n\nPlot summary\nThe Federation must contain a \"virogen\"  (plague) that is killing plant life, damaging animal young, and killing people on several vital systems that collectively supply food for the entire Federation. Avenger opens with the Federation trying to maintain a strict quarantine to contain the spread of the virogen as the Federation's reserves run low.  The Enterprise-E is assigned to a blockade of the Alta Vista system, home to the Gamrow Station, a research facility designed to house about 60 scientists which is temporarily being used as a refugee camp for 1400 people.   Captain Jean-Luc Picard and his crew attempt to stop a shuttlecraft, piloted by a Vulcan called Stron and a pregnant human woman, from fleeing the quarantined system, but the two appear to commit suicide by trying to jump into warp while caught in the Enterprise-E's tractor beam.  Picard, however, knowing that Vulcans believe suicide to be illogical, is unconvinced that the couple actually died in the warp core explosion.\nMeanwhile, on the once-verdant planet of Chal (first referenced in The Ashes of Eden), a mysterious stranger walks through the desolation towards a Starfleet medical outpost.  He meets with the commanding officer, Christine McDonald, and requests the location of the burial place of a native woman named Teilani.  He discovers, with Christine's help, that Teilani is not dead, not yet, but will be soon with the virogen quickly working through her body.  He goes to her and prepares an unusual herbal tea with dried leaves and hot water. Commander McDonald and the outpost's doctor, Andrea M'Benga, look on in amazement as Teilani begins to miraculously recover.  The stranger reveals to M'Benga that the leaves are Trannin leaves, native to the Klingon home planet.  Christine determines to send a message to Starfleet, announcing that a way to combat the virogen has been found. Christine's suspicions of the stranger's identity are aroused when Teilani calls the stranger \"James.\"  Her suspicions are further confirmed when she finds a plaque that the stranger had used as a tray for the tea, emblazoned with the name and number of the starship Enterprise from eighty years in the past.  Christine confronts the stranger with her belief that he is actually James T. Kirk, which he does not deny, insisting that she only refer to him as \"Jim,\" and that she reveal his real identity to no one. It is later revealed Kirk was saved by a fortuitous last-minute Borg transporter beam-out. Flung to another galaxy entirely, he materializes on a planet which is used as a dumping ground for the detritus of failed Borg missions. At the verge of death, on a planet near a galactic core, Kirk is discovered by beings who were able to release themselves from Borg assimilation. His body is purged of the Borg nanites which had been killing him, and after two years of working, living, and learning from, and with, the survivors, he discovers a Borg scout ship which he uses to return to the planet Chal.\nCaptain Picard dispatches a search party to an asteroid which was nearby to the explosion of the Vulcan shuttle to determine whether Stron and his wife really died there.  Commander Data confirms that there are no traces of organic particles in the area, thus proving that Stron and his mate somehow escaped the shuttle prior to its detonation.  However, the manner of their escape remains a mystery.  Picard reports his findings personally to the commander of the Gamrow Station, Chiton Kincaid, by beaming down alone to speak with her.  He realizes with horror as their conversation goes on that she was already, in fact, aware that Stron and the woman did not die in the explosion.  Before he can react, she attacks him with a disruptor and he blacks out.\nBack on Chal, Teilani is almost fully recovered, but still weak.  Kirk cares for her faithfully, and is in the process of building a home.  However, their peaceful life is jarringly interrupted when a wing of Orion pirates begin mercilessly attacking the medical base.  Jim begins running towards the base, only to be beamed up to Commander McDonald's ship, the U.S.S. Tobias.  Christine insists that Kirk momentarily assume command and take out the Orion fighters.  Reluctantly, Jim agrees on the condition that Teilani be beamed up immediately.  Once he knows she is safe, he takes a course of action by bringing the Tobias into the planet's atmosphere and successfully outmaneuvering the pirate ships.  To Christine's dismay, he insists on destroying all of the pirates, rather than letting the survivors flee.  Jim explains that Orions are mercenaries, with no reason to attack Chal if there's no money in it; someone must have intercepted Christine's message to Starfleet about the Trannin leaves, and sent the Orions to ravage the base.  Kirk's suspicions are aroused: there's no way in his mind that the rapid spread of the virogen is an accident.\nIt is soon discovered that the virogen outbreak was created intentionally by the Symmetrists, a group of eco-terrorists who have links to Captain James T. Kirk's past. The resurrected Kirk, along with Captain Jean-Luc Picard, and their respective crews, must unite to uncover the conspiracy that caused this before it undermines the Federation.\nAmbassador Spock, concurrently, is on a deeply personal mission of his own. He is personally bound to find the murderer of his father Sarek, believing that a conscious decision, not a disease, sealed his father's fate. He and Kirk reunite to avenge Sarek's death. During this time, Spock, though not entirely of his own volition, occasionally releases all his emotional self-control. This lack of control, uncharacteristic for a Vulcan, is a signature trait of Bendii disease, the same affliction which (supposedly) killed his father. Kirk and Spock discover that the people who assassinated Sarek are now after Spock, having infected him with a disease very similar to Bendii. It is revealed that a personal aide to both Sarek and Spock killed Sarek by using a poison whose effects were nearly identical to those of Bendii syndrome. In the end, it is Kirk, accompanied by Spock, who avenges Sarek's death. After, Kirk returns to Teilani and Spock is given treatment to expunge the poison from his body.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nAvenger at Memory Alpha","18":"Avenger (stylized as AVENGER) is an anime series, produced by Bandai Visual and Bee Train, and directed by Koichi Mashimo. It is set on post-apocalyptic colonized Mars. The 13-episode series premiered across Japan between 1 October 2003 and 24 December 2003 on the TV Tokyo network. It was later licensed for North American distribution by Bandai's distributive unit across the region, Bandai Entertainment.\n\nPlot\nThe story is set on a colonized Mars at some unspecified point in the future. Following the destruction of Earth, the majority of the human population is divided up into a number of small domed city-states.  Those who live outside the domes in the harsh wildernesses of the planet are known as Barbaroi.  Resources are scarce, and supplies are divided out between cities based on the outcome of gladiatorial battles between representative fighters from each city.  Adding to the problems of the colonists, no children have been born on Mars for a decade.  The cause of the infertility is unknown, but people have turned to child-size robots called dolls as a substitute for the presence of children in their lives.  And a red moon, Earth's moon, hangs over Mars, drawn towards the red planet after the destruction of Earth and ravaging it with lunar storms caused by gravitational fluctuations between Mars and its unwelcome satellite.\nThe protagonist of the story is Layla Ashley, a barbaroi gladiator from Serena City with a mysterious and tragic past and follows her quest to defeat Volk, the ruler of Mars.  She is accompanied on her journey by Nei, a strange \"doll\" whom she shares an deep emotional connection with, and Speedy, a doll breeder (or repairman) from the same city she's from.\n\nCharacters\nLayla Ashley (\u30ec\u30a4\u30e9\u30fb\u30a2\u30b7\u30e5\u30ec\u30a4)\nVoiced by: Megumi Toyoguchi (Japanese); Deborah Sale Butler (English)\nA silent, brooding young woman. As a young child, Layla became the only survivor of a colony ship which was shot down and destroyed by Volk over Mars-(under his orders) to prevent its human cargo from further taxing the planet's already stretched resources, with the ship's destruction having caused her parents deaths; she then sustained a huge scar on her back after the escape pod she was place into crash landed on Mars.  She was taken in and trained to fight by Cross-(her former mentor and legal guardian) in order to learn the art of gladiator battles, and is now determined to avenge her parents and the other passengers of the colony ship by defeating Volk in a gladiator battle.\nVolk (\u30f4\u30a9\u30eb\u30af)\nVoiced by: Hiroshi Yanaka (Japanese); Jamieson Price (English)\nOne of the \"Original Dozen,\" the first colonists to arrive on Mars, Volk's life has been greatly extended by science.  Ruler and representative gladiator of Volk City, he is the closest thing to an overall ruler Mars has, and it was he who chose to destroy the refugee ship on which a young Layla was a passenger.  He feels his responsibility very deeply, and takes every action for the greater good of Mars and its people.  Their well-being is his greatest concern, and he will commit whatever sin he has to in order to ensure it. It's been implicated throughout the series that he and Westa are in a romantic relationship and have been lovers even before they were on Mars.\nWesta (\u30a6\u30a7\u30b9\u30bf)\nVoiced by: Sumi Shimamoto (Japanese); Wendee Lee (English)\nAnother of the Original Dozen, Westa wields authority alongside Volk, but has a much more peaceful approach to solving problems.  She cares a great deal for the people of the planet, and her concern for them, combined with the fact that she does not age due to the same life-lengthening technology as Volk, has caused many of them to revere \"Goddess Westa\" almost as a deity. There are some implications throughout the series that she and Volk are lovers.\nNei (\u30cd\u30a4)\nVoiced by: Mika Kanai (Japanese); Elisa Fiorillo (English)\nA real 10-year-old human girl with different colored eyes. It's a mystery as to how she was born because Mars hasn't produced any children for a decade. She accompanies Layla everywhere, and is the only person or thing the stoic Layla seems to care for as the two girls have a strong bond with each other. Layla saw through Nei's disguise because she's been living outside the domed cities for so long, and has been living in the wild. Nei has been disguised and acting like a doll so she won't cause any trouble or attention to herself. She's been acting like a doll for so long that it has become a part of her a little bit. Nei follows Layla because she can act like herself and not like a doll around her. She has short blond hair-(which later turns light pink near the end of the series), and her eyes are green (right) and purple (left). In the last episode, it was revealed that \"she\" was mistaken for a \"he\". Nei is actually a female.\nSpeedy (\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3)\nVoiced by: Shinichito Yanaka (Japanese); Rick Robles (English)\nAn 18-year-old \"doll breeder,\" Speedy has a friendly, affable personality. Speedy finds himself drawn to Layla after watching her victory in a gladiator battle at the dome city he lived in. He is also curious about Layla's mysterious doll, Nei.\nCross (\u30af\u30ed\u30b9)\nVoiced by: TBA (Japanese); TBA (English)\nThe only other remaining member of the Original Dozen besides Volk, Westa and Jupiter, Cross (formerly known as Ares) left the dome cities after a disagreement with Volk-(who is later revealed to be his older brother) and lived in the wilds. He adopted Layla after the colony ship she and her parents were aboard was destroyed and trained her in gladiator combat.\nGarcia\nVoiced by: Katsuyuki Konishi (Japanese); Scott Burnett (English)\nA barbaroi gladiator, Garcia encounters Layla early in her journey when she briefly became the representative gladiator of a dome city.  Layla defeats Garcia in combat, but chooses to spare his life.  Their paths cross again several times afterwards, including one incident in which Garcia assists Layla and her party in fighting off the vicious hunter dolls pursuing Nei.\nPan (\u30d1\u30fc\u30f3)\nVoiced by: Isshin Chiba (Japanese); Terrence Stone (English)\n\nJupiter\nVoiced by: Kazuhiro Nakata (Japanese); Kim Strauss (English)\n\nAnime\nSoundtrack\nThe music for Avenger was composed and performed by Japanese duo Ali Project, which has also contributed music to several, other anime series, including CLAMP School Detectives, Noir, Princess Resurrection and .hack\/\/Roots.  The series opening Lunar Eclipse Grand Guignol (\u6708\u8755\u30b0\u30e9\u30f3\u30ae\u30cb\u30e7\u30eb Gesshoku Guran Ginyoru) and ending (Mirai no Eve) themes and the score overall are considered by some fans and reviewers to be among the show's most memorable elements.

It was founded by Vin Sullivan, an editor at Columbia Comics and before that the editor at National Allied Publications, the future DC Comics.\nMagazine Enterprises' characters include the jungle goddess Cave Girl, drawn by Bob Powell, and Ghost Rider, a horror fiction-themed Western avenger created by writer Ray Krank and artist Dick Ayers in 1949; after the trademark lapsed, Ayers and others adapted it as Marvel Comics' non-horror but otherwise near-identical Western character Ghost Rider in 1967.\nMagazine Enterprises should not be confused with the same-name Scottish company that published science fiction magazines from at least 1946 to 1960.\n\nPublication history\nIn late 1947, Superman creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster collaborated once again with editor Vin Sullivan, who had worked with the writer-artist team during their nascent days freelancing for National Allied Publications, the future DC Comics. The duo had decamped to Magazine Enterprises after leaving National Allied (by then called National Comics) and suing to regain the rights to Superman and their later creation, Superboy. Siegel and Shuster brought most of their studio's artists with them, except for 1950s Superman penciler Wayne Boring, and created the new character Funnyman, a slapstick-comedian hero. Both as a comic book and as a comic strip, however, the character failed to find an audience.\nMagazine Enterprises' best-known character may be Ghost Rider, a horror-themed Western avenger created by writer Ray Krank and artist Dick Ayers in 1949. After the trademark lapsed, Ayers and others adapted it as Marvel Comics' non-horror but otherwise near-identical Western character Ghost Rider in 1967.\nThe company's two superhero characters were the Avenger, created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Dick Ayers in The Avenger #1 (March 1955), with  Bob Powell drawing the character's three subsequent issues and all four covers; and the aptly named Strong Man, an unmasked, super-strong hero in a jungle-print circus strongman outfit. The Avenger was one of the very few traditional, costumed superheroes created during the period before superheroes' revival in what historians and fans call the Silver Age of Comics, beginning 1956.\nOther original characters include the jungle goddess Cave Girl, drawn by Bob Powell, and the talking animal canine hero Hot Dog, created by cartoonist George Crenshaw and unrelated to the later Archie Comics character of that name.\nAmong the company's publications were licensed film and TV comics featuring comedian Jimmy Durante; suave actor Dick Powell; and the CBS television series The Adventures of Robin Hood, starring Richard Greene. Additionally, Little Miss Sunbeam Comics starred the blond, pig-tailed mascot of Sunbeam Bread.\nSince the copyright to Magazine Enterprises' comics do not appear to have been renewed, they evidently fell into the public domain in accordance with copyright laws at the time.  Beginning in the 1980s, AC Comics issued reprint titles of Magazine Enterprises material, along with those of other defunct publishers of that era. As well, AC revived the Avenger as a guest star in FemForce #19 (1989; no cover date), then creating a new series.

The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011\u20132015 called it a general aviation facility.\n\nFacilities\nAvenger Field covers 896 acres (363 ha) at an elevation of 2,380 feet (725 m). It has two asphalt runways: 17\/35 is 5,840 by 100 feet (1,780 x 30 m) and 4\/22 is 5,658 by 75 feet (1,725 x 23 m).\nIn the year ending March 20, 2024, the airport had 3,900 general aviation aircraft operations, averaging 75 per week. 16 aircraft were then based at the airport: 13 single-engine, 1 multi-engine and 2 helicopter.\n\nHistory\nAs a Texas World War II Army Airfield, \"Avenger Field\" opened in August 1941 as a United States Army Air Forces training base of the AAF Flying Training Command, Gulf Coast Air Corps Training Center (later Central Flying Training Command).\n\nOrigins\nAvenger Field was the largest all-female air base in American history.  Its origins date to the 1920s as the Sweetwater Municipal Airport.    At the airport, a small flight school operated with World War I surplus Curtiss JN-4s and Curtiss Robins.\nIn the spring of 1942, the flight school was taken over by the Plosser-Prince Air Academy, which moved to the airport from California.  Plosser-Prince was contracted by the Royal Canadian Air Force to train British and American volunteer pilots.   The airport became known as British Flying Training School No. 7.   On 15 June 1942, about 100 male flight cadets began a course that included primary, basic and advanced training.  Just before they arrived, the Sweetwater Airport was renamed \"Avenger Field\" in a contest won by Mrs. Grace Faver.\nIn August 1942 the United States Government closed the private flying school and took it over as a United States Army Air Forces military installation.  Avenger Field was to be turned over to the Air Transport Command as a transition school for experienced airline pilots in single-engine Vultee BT-13 Valiant basic trainers.  From Avenger Field, the graduates would be sent to twin-engine schools and subsequently for overseas duty as USAAF pilots.\n\nWomen Airforce Service Pilots\nAt this time, Jacqueline Cochran was making plans for a training program for women pilots to participate in the war effort.   Working with the Army Air Forces, she established a training facility at the Howard Hughes field in Houston, Texas, for Women Airforce Service Pilots, or WASPs as it was known.  However, she was unable to develop a satisfactory school there.   In January 1943, she and the AAF began to look for an alternative location.   Avenger Field was chosen due to its multi-phase training capability and other assets. The field was acquired by the Houston contractors from  Plosser-Prince, and in February 1943 Avenger Field became an all-female installation except for a few male instructors and other officers.  The field was officially assigned to the 318th Army Air Forces Flying Training Detachment, 31st Flying Training Wing.  Flight training was contracted to Aviation Enterprises.\nClasses entered the WASP program at Avenger Field in monthly intervals. A total of 18 classes completed training: 8 in 1943 and 10 in 1944. Of the 25,000 women who applied for flight training, 1,830 were accepted, and of those, 1,074 received their wings.  Training for women pilots paralleled but did not duplicate that given the men. Because the women were expected to go into ferrying, emphasis was placed on cross-country flying. Gunnery and formation flight training was omitted.\nThe first course was four months long. Although the hours were flexible and varied according to previous training, 115 flying hours were generally called for in addition to 180 hours of ground instruction. As the experience level of the trainees declined, the course was expanded and revised. By the end of 1943, the length had been extended to 27 weeks and the flying hours to 210. Few curricular changes were made in 1944; the main one was increased training from 27 to 30 weeks.\n\nThe WASPs were employed under the Civil Service program. It was always assumed they would become part of the Army when a proper place within the military organization could be found for them. In fact, bills were introduced in Congress to give them military rank, but even with General Arnold's support, all efforts failed to absorb the WASPs into the military.\nAvenger Field remained a WASP training base until being disbanded in December 1944. 1,074 women pilots were trained at the facility including 37 that gave their lives in the service of their country.  On 20 December the Army Air Forces disbanded the WASP program and the WASPs returned to civilian life with no veterans' benefits. In 1977 Congress finally granted benefits to the 850 remaining WASPs.\nAt the end of the war the military decided the field was not needed and turned it over to the local government for civil use.\nThe first airline flights were on Pioneer in 1947; successor Continental's DC-3s stopped there until 1958\u201359.\n\nCold War radar station\nThe United States Air Force Air Defense Command exercised a right of return to Avenger Field in 1955 when Sweetwater Air Force Station was established as a USAF Aerospace Defense Command General Surveillance Radar Station.  The 683d Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was assigned to Sweetwater AFS (M-89) on 1 March 1956, being established in new facilities built on the northwest part of the station.  New military family housing was also constructed just to the east of the airport.  It initially operated AN\/MPS-11 search and AN\/TPS-10D height-finder radars, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station.  As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes.   In 1961 an AN\/FPS-6A replaced the AN\/TPS-10D height-finder radar.\nIn 1963 the AN\/FPS-6A evolved into an AN\/FPS-90, and on 31 July, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-89.\nIn addition to the main facility, Sweetwater operated several AN\/FPS-14 Gap Filler sites:\n\nBig Spring, TX (M-89B): 32\u00b013\u203250\u2033N 101\u00b029\u203231\u2033W\nSidney, TX     (M-89E): 31\u00b054\u203242\u2033N 098\u00b042\u203206\u2033W\nIn 1967 the search radar was replaced by an AN\/FPS-67B. The Air Force ordered Sweetwater AFS closed in 1969 due to budget reductions and the phasing down of Air Defense Command.  The 683d Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was inactivated on 30 September 1969.\nToday most of the cold war air force station has been redeveloped and new buildings have taken their place.  A few buildings remain, and the Air Force housing area remains, now single-family homes.\n\nSee also\nTexas World War II Army Airfields\n31st Flying Training Wing (World War II)\nList of airports in Texas\n\nReferences\nOther sources\nExternal links\n  \nAvenger Field (SWW) at Texas DOT airport directory\nWartime photos of Avenger Field\nWomen Air Force Service Pilots (W.A.S.P.)

Five additional short stories were published in Clues Detective magazine (1942\u20131943), and a sixth novelette in The Shadow magazine in 1943.  Decades later, newly written pastiches were commissioned and published by Warner Brothers' Paperback Library from 1973 to 1974.\nThe Avenger was a pulp hero who combined elements of Doc Savage and The Shadow. The authorship of the pulp series was credited by Street & Smith to Kenneth Robeson, the same byline that appeared on the Doc Savage stories. Most of the original Avenger stories were actually written by Paul Ernst. The \"Kenneth Robeson\" name was a house pseudonym used by a number of different Street & Smith writers.\n\nHistory\nIn the late 1930s following in the wake of a slew of magazine cancellations (The Skipper, Bill Barnes and The Whisperer \"had failed to capture the audience loyalty\" of Doc Savage and the Shadow), Street & Smith's circulation manager Henry William Ralston and editor John L. Nanovic set out to create a new hero combining elements of both. They obtained advice from Lester Dent and Walter B. Gibson in the creation of the Avenger, and hired writer Paul Ernst. Both Dent and Gibson met with Ernst to give him advice on his stories, Dent focused on characterization and Gibson on plotting. The character of the Avenger, described by pulp expert Don Hutchison as \"clearly an effort to form a hybrid of the company's more successful creations\", echoed his forebears in other ways also. Whereas Doc Savage was known as \"The Man of Bronze\", the Avenger was described as \"The Man of Steel\". The Avenger's \"marksman's eyes\" echoed the \"burning eyes\" of the Shadow, who continued to be referred to as \"The Masked Avenger\".\nWhen creating The Avenger, Paul Ernst drew on elements from characters he had previously created; Seekay (a private detective with a disfigured face who wears a plastic mask); The Wraith (a crimefighter who used both a knife and a gun); Dick Bullitt (with his gray features); Old Stone Face (the G-Man with the emotionless visage); the Gray Marauder and Karlu the Mystic.\nIn 1939, readers of Street & Smith's Doc Savage pulp magazine \"thrilled to a special announcement\" that a new periodical \u2014 The Avenger \u2014 \"was soon to be published\", and would feature stories \"written by none other than Kenneth Robeson, 'the familiar creator of Doc Savage'\".\nRobeson was actually a Street & Smith house name used by Ernst and a number of other authors, including Lester Dent, the actual writer of Doc Savage. The first issue of The Avenger was cover-dated September 1939, and featured a cover story\/\"lead novel\" entitled \"Justice Inc.\"  Interior art was produced by Paul Orban, well known to pulp fans for his \"similar work on Doc Savage and The Shadow\".\n\nPulp demise\nDescribing the stories as \"well-plotted\" with good characterization and \"an unusual amount of attention paid to detail\", Hutchison notes that as a derivative character, the Avenger was destined not to be as popular as his original rivals, which Hutchison gives as Doc Savage, The Spider, G-8, The Shadow, Operator #5 and the Phantom, while still arguing that the character \"can perhaps be considered the last of the great pulp heroes\".  His stories ran initially in his own magazine for 24 issues, first monthly and then (beginning with #13) bi-monthly in four volumes. The entire series ran exactly three years, ceasing publication in September 1942. The character was kept alive in Clues Detective with five additional short stories written by Emile Tepperman, plus an additional tale by Emile Tepperman which was published as a backup feature in a 1944 issue of The Shadow.\nIn Don Hutchison's estimation, the Avenger was following in big footsteps, and hamstrung by appearing too late in the day. Following the \"instant justice\" of The Shadow, the global stage of Doc Savage and other pulp heroes, the Avenger was, by 1939, \"simply an unnecessary commodity\". \"Second best[,] he had tried harder ... but the timing was all wrong.\" Ultimately, Hutchison concludes, \"The world did not require another good ten-cent hero.\"\n\nRevivals\nNevertheless, the character was revived in the 1970s by Warner Paperback Library, given a brief revival by DC Comics (in comic book form), and was the subject of new short stories in 2008 from Moonstone Books. (See below)\n\nCharacter biography\nOrigins\nThe Avenger's real name is Richard Henry Benson, a globe-trotting adventurer who \"had made his millions by professional adventuring\": discovering rubber in South America, leading \"native armies in Java\", making \"aerial maps in the Congo\", mining \"amethysts in Australia and emeralds in Brazil\" and finding gold in Alaska and diamonds in the Transvaal. Following the pulp archetype of a wealthy hero, despite an internal chronology making them (and Benson in particular) \"children of the Great Depression\", the Avenger's backstory gave him the funding to ultimately \"support [his] crime-fighting appurtenances\".\nDeciding to settle down and raise a family in the first Avenger novel (\"Justice, Inc.\"), Benson's plans for a peaceful life as a \"world-renowned industrial engineer\" are shattered when his wife (Alicia) and young daughter (Alice) are kidnapped and presumably killed (though their bodies are never found) by some criminals during an airplane journey from Buffalo to Canada. The shock of this loss has a bizarre effect on Benson. His face becomes paralyzed while both his skin and his hair turn white, his facial flesh becoming malleable, like modelling clay. His face was thereafter (for the first dozen stories) regularly described (as in \"The Smiling Dogs\") as\n\n...dead, like something dug out of a cemetery. The muscles were paralyzed so that never, under any circumstances, could they move in an expression. This dead, weird face was as white as snow \u2013 as white, in a word, as you'd expect any dead flesh to be! In the glacial expanse of the face were set eyes so light-gray as to seem completely colorless.\nAs a result of this tragedy, Benson vows to avenge himself on the villains, and to fight for all those who have suffered at the hands of criminals.\nDon Hutchison suggests that \"Benson's extreme personal misfortune was probably the strongest motivation accorded any of the great pulp heroes,\" stemming as it did from the death of his family and his own \"death in life\". The stories, by veteran pulp\/magazine writer Paul Ernst \"were well-plotted mysteries with mild science-fictional extrapolations\", albeit often appearing somewhat subdued when compared to rival publications such as The Spider and Operator #5. Benson was \"the master of the last-minute escape\", cool and intellectual, mentally \"the equal of Doc Savage\" but otherwise \"an average-sized man\". The plastic, malleable state of his otherwise immobile features allowed the character to physically reshape his face with his fingers into a likeness of any person, his features remaining in sculpted form \"until they were carefully put back into place\". This ability, coupled with hair dyes and colored contact lenses, earned him the sobriquet \"The Man of a Thousand Faces\".\n\nNew face\nAfter twelve issues, Ernst was directed editorially to eliminate Benson's facial affliction in the hopes that this would bolster the dwindling audience for the magazine. Thus the second \"distinct era\" of the Avenger began with the first issue of the now-bi-monthly third volume (#13), just over a year after the magazine's debut.\nThe thirteenth issue, \"Murder On Wheels\", saw the introduction of the last major recurring character, Cole Wilson. Initially an opponent of the Avenger (before joining Justice, Inc. in the same issue), Wilson trapped the Avenger in a machine which \"provided a nerve shock of a different sort\", turning Benson's flesh back to normal and his hair black. Although the Avenger still disguised himself after this, he could no longer mold his now normal flesh. Three stories \u2013 \"Nevlo\" (#17), \"House of Death\" (#15) and \"Death in Slow Motion\" (#18) \u2013 had been written by Ernst prior to this radical shift in character, and underwent rewrites before seeing publication. Although the original texts would place these three stories chronologically earlier than #13, the rewrites serve to fit them into the timelines as published (although some slight original traces remain under the heavy-handed later insertions). Often dismissed as a late addition to the stories, Cole Wilson was to play a greater part in the last dozen pastiches written in the 1970s by Ron Goulart.\n\nGadgets\nThe Avenger far preferred tricking criminals into \"destroy[ing] themselves in traps of their own devising\" to killing them himself, allowing writer Ernst to create considerably elaborate plots.\nLike Doc Savage, Benson relies on a variety of special gadgets to help him overcome criminals. These include knockout gas bombs, miniature two-way radios, a woven, transparent bullet-proof garment and \"glass pellets containing a gas... [which] instantly [spread] a black impenetrable pall like instant night\", also accessible through a stud on Benson's collar.\nHis car rivalled those of the later James Bond series, \"being a rather dull 1935 model\" capable of speeds up to 130 mph (unheard of at the time), \"bullet-proofed throughout and equipped with devices and special little inventions for offence and defence\", including automatic bullet-proofed windows and \"miniature torpedoes of potent knock-out gas\".\nThe Avenger also carried a pair of weapons \"strapped in slim sheaths on [his] right and left calf\" \u2013 his specially streamlined and silenced .22 revolver (\"Mike\") and a needle-pointed throwing knife (\"Ike\"). Using these customized tools, Benson could shoot someone so that his bullet just touched their heads and knocked them out, or \"hit a fly-speck from twenty feet\".\n\nAssistants\nLike Doc Savage before him, Benson rarely underwent his adventures alone, gathering a number of assistants to help him. His small band, known as \"Justice, Inc.\", was made up of people who had all been \"irreparably damaged by crime\", and who have specialized skills:\n\nFergus \"Mac\" MacMurdie (\"Justice, Inc.\") is a stereotypically dour Scotsman who is also a gifted pharmacist and chemist. His family was killed by racketeers, leaving Mac embittered, vengeful and \"indifferent to the threat of... death\".\nAlgernon Heathcote \"Smitty\" Smith (\"Justice, Inc.\") is a gigantic man (6' 9\") of incredible strength. Smitty looks slow and stupid, but he is actually a genius with electronics. He was framed \u2013 and spent a year in jail \u2013 for a crime he did not commit, and initially attacked Benson, believing the Avenger was out to arrest him.\nNellie Gray (\"The Yellow Hoard\"), \"the Emma Peel of her day\", is a beautiful, delicate-looking young woman who is actually an expert at jujutsu and other martial arts. Her archaeologist father was killed by criminals for the buried Aztec gold he had found. After his murder was solved by Benson's Justice Inc., the treasure \"became the equivalent of Doc Savage's hoard of inexhaustible Mayan gold\".\nJosh and Rosabel Newton (\"The Sky Walker\") are an African American couple whose employers were killed by criminals. They often go undercover as domestic servants, making use of the stereotypes of the time to hide their investigative abilities, in \"an ironic comment on the image. .. in the films and fiction of the day\".  Both are graduates of the Tuskegee Institute (now University), and the couple have children later in the series. (The Avenger is notable for its presentation of minorities.  While many of the pulp magazines of the time are well known for racist stereotypes, both Josh and Rosabel are always presented as brave, intelligent people of good character.)\nCole Wilson joins the group near the middle of the series. He is much less distinctive than Benson's other assistants and has a light-hearted manner that contrasts the Avenger's serious tone, described as having \"a streak of Robin Hood in him\".\n\nAvenger novels and short stories\nThe Avenger (1939\u20131942)\nNovels written by Paul Ernst and published in The Avenger magazine. The first thirteen stories are believed to have been published in the order in which they were written. After the considerable changes introduced in Murder on Wheels (Nov. 1940), three already-finished stories were reworked by Street & Smith's editors to match them to the new format. Since they were reworked, the stories nevertheless follow internal chronology as well as publication order.\nThe first two volumes appeared monthly (with the exception of the twelfth issue), and featured covers by Harold Winfield Scott (\"H.W. Scott\"). Volumes III and IV (#'s 13 through 24) were covered in artwork by \"Graves Gladney, Lenosci and Leslie Ross\".\n\nVolume I\n1. Justice, Inc., published September 1, 1939\n2.

Midnight Murder, published September 1, 1942\n\nClues Detective (1942\u20131943)\nShort stories later written by Emile C. Tepperman and published in Clues Detective magazine. Internal dates and references have led some pulp experts to adjust the numbering a bit on Tepperman's short stories. These stories by Tepperman were not reprinted in the 1970s, probably due to their brevity.\n\n25. Death to the Avenger, published September 1, 1942\n26.

To Find a Dead Man, published August 1, 1944\n\nWarner Paperback Library (1972\u20131975)\nFollowing the original 24 pulp novels by Paul Ernst, and the half-dozen short stories written by Emile C. Tepperman (also under the \"Kenneth Robeson\" pseudonym) in the 1940s, Warner Paperback Library (30 years later) reprinted the original twenty-four Avenger novels in a paperback book format similar to Bantam Books' successful Doc Savage reprint library.\nContinuing on after #24, Warner commissioned ghost writer Ron Goulart to write 12 brand new pastiche novels to extend the paperback reprint series to #36, ignoring Tepperman's six short stories from the 1940s in favor of brand new book-length tales. The covers for the 1970s Avenger paperback series were initially painted by Peter Caras, and later by George Gross. These fit chronologically after the six Tepperman stories, but were numbered by Warner from #25 through #36 (since Warner skipped over the Tepperman stories). Steve Holland (actor) was the model for Benson on the cover art, as he was for Doc Savage in Bantam's paperback reprints of that series.\nNote: Numbers in parentheses denote Warner Paperback Library's designation.\n\n31.

In 2008, a prose anthology (available in paperback and limited edition hardback) was released containing new stories featuring the Avenger, with covers by Dave Dorman, 1970s paperback cover artist Peter Caras, and a Limited Edition cover by Douglas Klauba. The anthology was edited by Joe Gentile and Howard Hopkins, and featured numerous stories by authors including Gentile, Hopkins, Ron Goulart, Will Murray, Win Scott Eckert, Richard Dean Starr, Tom DeFalco, Paul Kupperberg, Mel Odom, and others.\nMoonstone has also announced plans to continue the novel series. To date, they have released one new title.\n\n43. The Sun King by Matthew Baugh, published July 7, 2015\n44. Double Feature by Bobby Nash and Chuck Miller, published November 14, 2018\n45.

Each issue reprinted two novels and contains the original black-and-white interior illustrations from the pulps as well as the original pulp magazine covers on front and back.  This is similar to their current reprint series of Doc Savage and The Shadow.\n\nContinuations, extrapolations\nThe Avenger is mentioned by author Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer as a part of his Wold Newton family, and in an essay published in Myths for the Modern Age: Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer's Wold Newton Universe (MonkeyBrain Books, 2005), Chuck Loridans contributes an article entitled \"The Daughters of Greystoke\" wherein he constructs a family tree linking Nellie Gray to Tarzan and Jane Porter.\nIn 2008, Moonstone Books produced the first The Avenger anthology, featuring stories written by a number of variant pulp fans and writers \u2013 including Ron Goulart and the Myths for the Modern Age editor Win Scott Eckert.\n\nComics\nThere have been several attempts to revive the Avenger as a comic book character, beginning in the 1940s in Street & Smith's own Shadow Comics, but none (to date) have proved particularly successful. The character first appeared in Shadow Comics #2 (Feb 1940), and made seven appearances until 1944.\nIn 1975, DC Comics published a comic called Justice, Inc. which starred the Avenger.  This was during the time they were also publishing The Shadow.  The Avenger also appeared in issue #11 of The Shadow.  The first two issues were based on stories from the pulp magazine.  Issues #2\u20134 were drawn by Jack Kirby (as were the covers to issues #2 and #3).  The comic only lasted four issues.\nIn the 1980s, when DC Comics was again doing The Shadow, an \"updated\" version of the Avenger showed up briefly.  In 1989, DC released a two-issue miniseries, in 52-page prestige format, written by Andy Helfer and pencilled and inked by Kyle Baker, titled Justice, Inc..  The miniseries revealed the 'truth' behind the Avenger's origin.\nIn November 2009 the Avenger showed up in the series The First Wave spun off from the Batman\/Doc Savage Special. The Avenger had a backup series in the new Doc Savage (2010) comic, written by award-winning thriller novelist Jason Starr. However, several alterations were made to his aides and to Justice, Inc.  The series ran in Doc Savage issues #1\u20139, plus he starred in the First Wave Special.\nIn August 2014, the Avenger appeared in a five-part miniseries published by Dynamite Entertainment, titled Justice, Inc., appearing together with The Shadow and Doc Savage.  A one-shot issue of Justice, Inc. appeared in December, 2014 titled The Television Killers.\n\nRadio\nSimilarly short-lived was \"an Avenger radio serial carried by Station WHN in New York City and syndicated in other parts of the country\". From July 18, 1941, to November 3, 1942, the pulp novel Avenger was on the air in a series based on the magazine.\n(Script excerpt from The Avenger radio program, airdate: Tuesday, September 9, 1941 9:30\u201310:00 p.m.)\nMUSIC: \t\t(ORGAN)  AVENGER HUM WITH CODE\nBENSON: \tEnemies of Justice...This is The Avenger!\nMUSIC:\t\tUP WITH THEME, THEN SEGUE TO MOOD (KEEP IN BACKGROUND)\nBENSON:\tYou who operate beyond the Law... you who seek to wreck the peace of America...

It also seems to have aired on many stations across the United States as a transcription series. The 62 weeks refer only to the period during which the program aired, not the number of shows. There were apparently a number of preemptions, due to coverage of sporting events. Most likely, the series consisted of a then standard run of 26 half-hour episodes (plus repeats). Unfortunately, despite the fact that the program was recorded for syndication, the only remaining artifacts of the show are seven scripts.\nAll of these are from the first nine weeks of the show, one of which is an original script entitled Tear Drop Tank. The others are The Hate Master, River of Ice, Three Gold Crowns, The Blood Ring, The Devil's Horns, and The Avenger. All are based on the magazine novels of the same name, with the exception of The Avenger, which is based on the second adventure, The Yellow Hoard.  None of the scripts mentions the production crew or cast\u2014in fact, the first three surviving scripts do not even list the authors.\nThe final four remaining scripts (judging by the airdates listed) were all written by Maurice Joachim. Maurice Joachim was an actor and radio scriptwriter, who wrote episodes of the 1940s WMCA-produced Doc Savage series. It is quite likely he also acted on the Avenger, as he was reputed to be a highly versatile actor -\u2013 in the mid-1930s he hosted the Majestic Master of Mystery program, and played all the parts himself. Only Joachim and the organist were credited in the script, which had the announcer give the credit \"with original music by Dick Ballou\".\nThese directions specified a Morse Code motif for the music, which was echoed in the sound effects. In the scripts earliest scripts, the \"Avenger Hum\" is mentioned within the episodes, as in them the impression is given that Richard Benson has a radio unit surgically implanted inside him, and thus his entrances are heralded by a carrier wave tone. This somewhat unsettling idea is dropped at some point in the series, with the novels' compact belt radios used instead.\nThe surviving scripts do not include the African American characters, Josuah and Rosabel Newton, nor the young Cole Wilson.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nA Chronology For The Avenger\nDr. Hermes's Reviews for The Avenger\nAvenger page at International Catalog of Superheroes","23":"The  Tank, Cruiser, Challenger (A30) was a British tank of World War II. It mounted the QF 17-pounder anti-tank gun on a chassis derived from the Cromwell tank to add anti-tank firepower to the cruiser tank units. The design compromises made in fitting the large gun onto the Cromwell chassis resulted in a tank with a powerful weapon and reduced armour. However, the extemporised 17-pounder Sherman Firefly conversion of the US-supplied Sherman proved easier to produce and, with delays in production, only 200 Challengers were built. The Challenger was able to keep up with the fast Cromwell tank and was used with them.\n\nHistory\nThe driving force in the development of the Challenger was William Arthur Robotham. \"Roy\" Robotham had been a Rolls-Royce executive in the car division who, with no work to do, had led a team to develop a tank powerplant from the Rolls-Royce Merlin aircraft engine. The Rolls-Royce Meteor gave the British a powerful, reliable engine, which was used in the A27M Cruiser Mk VIII Cromwell tank. Robotham's contributions gained him a place in the Ministry of Supply and on the Tank Board, despite his lack of experience in tank design.\nThe General Staff brought forward specification A29 for a 45 ton, 17 pounder-armed cruiser tank based on needs identified in the African desert campaign. British tanks were generally underarmed compared to German vehicles. The design weight of this vehicle was subsequently seen as excessive and the specification was passed over in favour of the alternate specification, A30, which was 10 long tons (10 t) lighter. In 1942, an order for the development of an A30 based tank was placed with Birmingham Railway Carriage & Wagon Company (BRC&W) expecting it to be based on the Cromwell components also being manufactured by BRC&W. The turret and gun mounting were in the hands of Stothert & Pitt. Birmingham Carriage had to modify the Cromwell hull to take a bigger turret.\nThe first prototype was ready in August 1942, only seven months after development had commenced, but proved to be very flawed.  An improved second prototype was presented in January 1943 but was still considered unacceptable.  A committee met to determine whether a requirement for a 17-pounder tank existed. The Challenger had been developed in anticipation of more heavily armoured Axis tanks, following the trend in Nazi German tank design. At roughly the same time the Tiger I entered service with the German army, placing an immediate need for a 17-pounder armed tank in response.\nWhen the second prototype was tested at Lulworth, it was found that although it would be effective at long range against the current best-gunned tank in German service (the Panzer IV \"Special\" with the long 75 mm (3.0 in) gun), at shorter ranges it would be at a disadvantage due to its slow firing rate and thin armour. The design received additional emphasis when, in May 1943, it was found that the Cromwell could not carry its intended armament. Vickers had been developing a 75 mm (3.0 in) 50-calibre-long high-velocity tank gun. It was realised late in the design process that the Cromwell's turret ring was too small for this gun. The Challenger would be the only British cruiser tank to mount a weapon that could tackle heavier German armour until the arrival of the A34 Comet. So in February 1943 an order was made of two hundred vehicles; the Army General Staff took five months to approve the Challenger design for production (in February 1943, the only significant alteration was to the ammunition stowage), and Robotham was also critical of the decision to continue manufacturing the Cromwell with a 6-pounder gun (the 17-pounder gun was \"infinitely better\").\nBritish tank production was constrained by limited resources and insufficient numbers could be made. This was compensated by American production. In the lead up to D-Day, Sherman tanks were fitted with the 17 pounder, creating the interim 17 pounder Sherman Firefly. Converting Sherman tanks was simpler than producing Challengers, so it was decided in November 1943 to terminate the A30 production run after the two hundred vehicles had been built, allowing BRC&W to concentrate on the Cromwell. At the same time the A 40 \"Challenger Stage II\" project was cancelled, which had envisaged a 36 tonne type with heavier armour. Future design priority was concentrated on the A34 Comet, which eventually replaced the Cromwell, Firefly and Challenger. Challenger production started in March 1944. That year 145 vehicles were delivered with another 52 in 1945. Production was in two batches. A first run of forty vehicles had a 40 mm gun mantlet; with the second batch this was replaced by a 102 mm mantlet. From the hundredth vehicle onwards appliqu\u00e9 25 mm armour plates were fitted on the turret, that had already been applied to existing vehicles by field units.\nThe tank was rendered obsolete when the Vickers HV 75 mm gun was developed to become the 77 mm HV (actually 3 inch = 76.2 mm calibre) to arm the Comet tank.  The 77 mm HV used the same projectiles as the 17 pounder with a reduced propellant charge. The 17 pounder gun was used on the earliest marks of the Comet's successor, the Centurion tank.\n\nDesign\nThe turret mounted the Ordnance QF 17-pounder gun required in the Tank Board specification and the hull machine gun was removed to provide stowage space for the long 17-pounder cartridges. The War Office expected that this larger ammunition, together with its stowage forward, would require two loaders alongside the commander and gunner in the turret. To fit the larger weapon and additional crewman in the turret, a much larger turret than that of the Cromwell was specified, developed separately, which had a significant effect on the design and was not resolved until later development of Avenger.\nTo carry the weight of the 17-pounder and ammunition, an extra wheel station and suspension arm was needed, lengthening the hull. This change in length, without a corresponding change in width across the tracks, reduced mobility compared to the Cromwell, although speed remained high at 25 mph. To limit the weight, the amount of armour was reduced but this could only be achieved on the turret, 63 mm (2.5 in) on the front (the mantlet was 102 mm of IT 90)  and 40 mm (1.6 in) on the sides compared to 75 mm (3.0 in) and 60 mm (2.4 in) on the Cromwell. Applique armour, 25 mm thick, was later added to turret and hull front. The turret did not use a conventional turret ring: to increase the aperture diameter by four inches, it rested on a ball mount on the hull floor. Therefore the base of the turret was unprotected, and it would cantilever if struck by enemy rounds. A jacking feature, with four internal semi-automatic jacks, was fitted to clear jams. The additional length allowed larger hatches to be fitted in the hull while still clearing the turret, providing easier access than Cromwell.\nUpon Robotham's appointment as Chief Engineer to the Department of Tank Design, the lack of progress on an (A29) 17-pounder armed tank could not adequately be explained. Robotham's memoirs indicate a lack of awareness that any such requirement existed within the department and military users were still unsure whether the tank was required at the point when the rushed A30 design had been completed and prototype vehicles run. The Challenger was then rushed into production alongside existing production runs of Cromwell, limiting the number of tanks that could be produced.\n\nPerformance\nThe 17-pounder gun mounted on the Challenger offered sufficient performance against the majority of German AFVs, including the Tiger I and Panther tank and the tank had a higher top speed and cross country mobility than the Panzer IV or StuG III. The Challenger could only hold 48 rounds of the large 17-pounder ammunition because the General Staff required four men in the turret, though later tanks like the Centurion used a three-man turret. The armour of the Challenger offered very little protection against contemporary German anti-tank guns and was lower than that of the Cromwell, which often operated with Challengers.\nIn combat, the Challenger fulfilled much the same role as the Sherman Firefly, providing overwatch for the other tanks in the troop, as its 17-pounder could penetrate almost all German AFVs frontally, unlike the 75 mm. It was deployed in a similar manner at a troop level, this was typically one 17-pounder armed tank (such as Challenger or Firefly) to three 75 mm armed tanks (Cromwells or Shermans); at times, the deployment of 17-pounder armed tanks was increased to two per troop.\nThe Challenger was based on the reliable Cromwell tank, which used the new Rolls-Royce Meteor engine, which was far more reliable and powerful than the ageing Liberty engine used in earlier British Cruiser designs like the Crusader tank. Its reliability was slightly below that of the Cromwell, as a problem was experienced with track throwing, caused by mud building up in the wheels but this was resolved in the field. Supply and maintenance were vastly simplified through the use of common parts with the Cromwell.\nIn comparison with the Firefly, the tank lacked the sloping forward armour but presented a lower profile and avoided the Firefly's constraint on gun depression. The Challenger provided 10\u00b0 of gun depression while Firefly was limited to 5\u00b0, which was a significant disadvantage in combat. It was preferred within Cromwell units as it shared similar mobility and manoeuvrability, whereas the Firefly was slower. Despite a lower design weight than the earlier A29 specification (32\u00bd not 34 tons), the Challenger was heavy and required dockyard equipment to ship, making it impractical to use in amphibious assaults such as the D-day landings.\n\nService\nNo provision was made for deep wading, before the design went into production; as a result, the A30 could not be landed in the initial phase of the Allied invasion of Normandy. Challenger crews had to wait until July 1944, when Mulberry harbours were operational and ports had been captured.\nThe Challenger and Firefly, equipped with 17-pounder, were added to tank squadrons to deal with opposing heavy tanks and many Challengers were issued to reconnaissance units using Cromwells. It was initially used by the Guards Armoured Division and the 11th Armoured Division, with about sixteen vehicles in each unit: one Challenger and three Cromwells in each troop. The latter division phased the type out from February 1945 onwards, while it was being introduced to the Cromwell units of the 7th Armoured Division. The tank was unpopular at first, with crews complaining about the lack of armour, the high silhouette and the tracks being thrown. The track problem was caused by the smaller idler wheels compared to the Cromwell; these were in August replaced by idlers with a standard diameter. Troops used to the low profile of the Crusader and Cromwell found the height a serious problem, although it was still shorter than the comparable Sherman Firefly.\nConfidence in the vehicle grew and it became preferred over the Firefly, being lower, faster and more manoeuvrable but the early bad reputation persisted with others. Allied forces were issued with the Challenger, the 1st Polish Armoured Division receiving several in mid-1945 and the 1st Czechoslovak Independent Armoured Brigade used it (Unit Entitlements at the end of 1944 for CIABG was four  Challengers) during the siege of Dunkirk in late 1944. After the war, the Czechoslovak government purchased 22 Challengers from the brigade inventory, which served in the Czechoslovak army (first with the 11th, later 23rd, Tank Brigade and then with the 13th Independent Tank Battalion) until they were put in reserve in 1951 and scrapped in 1959.\n\nVariants\nThe A30 Avenger SP2 or SP 17pdr, A30 (Avenger) was a development of the Challenger to be used as a self-propelled gun. It removed the second loader's position and featured a much lower profile turret and lower superstructure on the hull. An additional stowage bin was provided on the glacis plate for a large camo net and return rollers were added to the tracks.\nThe Avenger featured a permanent opening in the turret roof covered with an armoured cover supported a few inches above. This provided the commander and loader with full 360 degree visibility.\nBy the time the pilot was complete, the British had lend-lease M10s for anti-tank work coming into service and the production of Avenger was de-prioritised in favour of Comet production \nAs many as 500 vehicles appear to have been planned and 230 vehicles were ordered from BRC&W, but this dropped to 80 with the end of the war. It is not known how many were actually built; the SP2 nomenclature indicates its place in production with the Archer (SP1) and Alecto (SP3).\nThe Avenger suffered in trials as the engine had to remain running to use the turret traverse motor, because the noise and exhaust could give the vehicle away. Winter trials in a prolonged stationary position also failed in comparison with Archer, when the Avenger's steering failed. Both vehicles had problems with camouflage. The vehicle was dropped from trials in 1950, along with removal of the 17pdr SP Achilles (re-gunned US M10 GMC- equipped with 17pdr).\nWhile the Avenger was only used for trials and was ultimately unsuccessful in comparison with the purpose built vehicles, it provides an example of what could have been possible for the Challenger had it not been forced to accommodate a second loader in a larger (four-man) turret in its design. It may have been corrected had effort not been moved to the Comet.\n\nSurvivors\nTwo vehicles survive, one at the Overloon War Museum in the Netherlands, acquired from the Muzeeaquarium Delfzijl in 1976; the other was awaiting restoration at the Isle of Wight Military Museum in the United Kingdom until its closure. Once restored, it will be displayed at the Bovington Tank Museum.\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBingham, James (1971). AFV Profile No. 25 Cromwell and Comet.

The original monster truck sported a forest green Chevrolet S10 body style and a teal chassis and rims. With the exception of the design featured at World Finals 14, the Avenger truck has always sported at least three flaming skulls (one on each side and one on the hood) and flowing flames running from the wheel wells. As time passed, the S10 body was replaced by a 1957 Chevrolet Bel-Air body with bright green headlights, which is the same body style that is run today by \"Mr. Excitement.\"\nAvenger is out of the Team Scream stable, which also features the Brutus, Mega-Bite, Spike, Rage, Axe, and Wrecking Crew trucks.

He won his first world championship title in 2003 with the original Forest Green Bel-Air and teal chassis, Jim shocked the Monster Jam World by being the first Freestyle Champion not named Dennis Anderson or Tom Meents. The following year in 2004 Koehler was stopped on him. He bent a 4-link bar that caused the transmission to break after he went over the cars, causing him to be frustrated. In March 2011, with his red \"Las Vegas\" Avenger, Jim tied with Cam McQueen in the Nitro Circus Monster Truck in the Freestyle competition, edging out McQueen to claim his second Freestyle title, making Jim Koehler one of only three drivers to have more than one Freestyle title at the World Finals, the others being Tom Meents and Adam Anderson (monster truck driver).\nIn 2009, Avenger went places that it had never ventured before with the debut of Aussie Avenger, built specifically for the Extreme Monster Trucks Australia tour.

Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the sequel to The Avengers (2012) and the 11th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Written and directed by Joss Whedon, the film features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany, Cobie Smulders, Anthony Mackie, Hayley Atwell, Idris Elba, Linda Cardellini, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, James Spader, and Samuel L. Jackson. In the film, the Avengers fight Ultron (Spader)\u2014an artificial intelligence created by Tony Stark (Downey) and Bruce Banner (Ruffalo)\u2014who plans to bring about world peace by causing human extinction.\nThe sequel was announced in May 2012 after the successful release of The Avengers, with Whedon set to return as writer and director in August. Whedon updated Ultron's origin for the film to involve the MCU's Avengers team and introduced the characters Pietro (Taylor-Johnson) and Wanda Maximoff (Olsen), to whom Marvel shared the rights with 20th Century Fox. Casting began in June 2013 with Downey re-signing. Second unit filming began in February 2014 in South Africa, with principal photography taking place between March and August, primarily at Shepperton Studios in Surrey, England. Additional footage was filmed in Italy, South Korea, Bangladesh, the state of New York, and around England. With an estimated net production budget of $365 million, the film is one of the most expensive films ever made.\nAvengers: Age of Ultron premiered in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on April 13, 2015, and was released in the United States on May 1, as part of Phase Two of the MCU. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed over $1.4 billion worldwide, becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2015 and the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time during its run. Two sequels have been released: Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019).\n\nPlot\nIn the Eastern European country of Sokovia, the Avengers\u2014Tony Stark, Thor, Bruce Banner, Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, and Clint Barton\u2014raid a Hydra facility commanded by Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, who has experimented on humans using the scepter previously wielded by Loki. They meet two of Strucker's test subjects\u2014twins Pietro (superhuman speed) and Wanda Maximoff (telepathic and telekinetic abilities)\u2014and apprehend Strucker while Stark retrieves Loki's scepter.\nStark and Banner discover an artificial intelligence within the scepter's gem and secretly use it to complete Stark's \"Ultron\" global defense program. The unexpectedly sentient Ultron, believing he must eradicate humanity to save Earth, eliminates Stark's AI J.A.R.V.I.S. and attacks the Avengers at their headquarters. Escaping with the scepter, Ultron uses the resources in Strucker's Sokovia base to upgrade his rudimentary body and build an army of robot drones. Having killed Strucker, he recruits the Maximoffs, who hold Stark responsible for their parents' deaths by his company's weapons and goes to the base of arms dealer Ulysses Klaue in Johannesburg to get vibranium. The Avengers attack Ultron and the Maximoffs, but Wanda subdues them with haunting visions, causing Banner to turn into the Hulk and rampage until Stark stops him with his anti-Hulk armor.\nA worldwide backlash over the resulting destruction, and the fears Wanda's hallucinations incited, send the team into hiding at Barton's farmhouse. Thor departs to consult with Dr. Erik Selvig on the apocalyptic future he saw in his hallucination, while Nick Fury arrives and encourages the team to form a plan to stop Ultron. In Seoul, Ultron uses Loki's scepter to enslave the team's friend Helen Cho. They use her synthetic-tissue technology, vibranium, and the scepter's gem to craft a new body. As Ultron uploads himself into the body, Wanda is able to read his mind; discovering his plan for human extinction, the Maximoffs turn against Ultron. Rogers, Romanoff, and Barton fight Ultron and retrieve the synthetic body, but Ultron captures Romanoff. The Avengers fight among themselves when Stark and Banner secretly upload J.A.R.V.I.S.\u2014who is still working after hiding from Ultron inside the Internet\u2014into the synthetic body.\nThor returns to help activate the body, based on his vision that the gem on its brow is the Mind Stone, one of the six Infinity Stones, the most powerful objects in existence. This \"Vision\" earns their trust by being worthy of lifting Thor's hammer, Mj\u00f6lnir. Vision and the Maximoffs go with the Avengers to Sokovia, where Ultron has used the remaining vibranium to build a machine to lift a large part of the capital city skyward, intending to crash it into the ground to cause global extinction. Banner rescues Romanoff, who awakens the Hulk for the battle. The Avengers fight Ultron's army while Fury arrives in a Helicarrier with Maria Hill, James Rhodes, and S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to evacuate civilians.\nPietro dies when he shields Barton from gunfire, and a vengeful Wanda abandons her post to destroy Ultron's primary body, which allows one of his drones to activate the machine. The city plummets, but Stark and Thor overload the machine and shatter the landmass. In the aftermath, the Hulk, unwilling to endanger Romanoff by being with her, departs in a Quinjet, while Vision confronts and destroys Ultron's last remaining body. Later, with the Avengers having established a new base run by Fury, Hill, Cho, and Selvig, Thor returns to Asgard to learn more about the forces he suspects have manipulated recent events. As Stark leaves and Barton retires, Rogers and Romanoff prepare to train new Avengers: Rhodes, Vision, Sam Wilson, and Wanda.\nIn a mid-credits scene, Thanos dons a gauntlet and vows to retrieve the Infinity Stones himself.\n\nCast\nRobert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark \/ Iron Man: The benefactor of the Avengers who is a self-described genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist with electromechanical suits of armor of his own invention. On how his character evolves after the events of Iron Man 3 (2013), Downey said, \"I think he realizes that tweaking and making all the suits in the world\u2014which is what he has been doing\u2014still didn't work for that thing of his tour of duty that left him a little PTSD. So his focus is more on how can we make it so that there's no problem to begin with. That, you know, there's a bouncer at our planet's rope. That's the big idea.\"\nChris Hemsworth as Thor: An Avenger and the crown prince of Asgard, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name. Regarding Thor's place in the film, Hemsworth stated that as Thor has remained on Earth since Thor: The Dark World (2013), and has begun to feel at home here, he considers Ultron's threat a personal attack. Hemsworth stated that he had to work harder to bring new elements to the character to avoid repeating himself saying, \"It gave us room to kind of make him a little more grounded and human and have him in some civilian clothes and mixing it up at a party.\" Hemsworth noted that Thor's motivations in this film were completely different, as it was the first MCU film where he did not play against Tom Hiddleston's character of Loki.\nMark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner \/ Hulk: An Avenger and genius scientist who, because of exposure to gamma radiation, transforms into a monster when enraged or agitated. To prepare for the role, Ruffalo worked with motion capture performer Andy Serkis' The Imaginarium. He stated that his character had grown since the previous film and was \"a bit more complex\". Ruffalo explained that a confrontation is brewing between Banner and the Hulk saying, \"There's a very cool thing happening: Hulk is as afraid of Banner as Banner is afraid of Hulk.. and they have got to come to peace somehow with each other.\" While filming in London, Ruffalo said that Whedon still had not given him any of the Hulk's lines. Whedon later explained that he writes the Hulk's dialogue spontaneously, saying, \"What makes the Hulk so hard to write is that you're pretending he's a werewolf when he's a superhero. You want it vice versa [...] So the question is, how has he progressed? How can we bring changes on what the Hulk does? And that's not just in the screenplay, that's moment to moment.\"\nChris Evans as Steve Rogers \/ Captain America: The leader of the Avengers and a World War II veteran who was enhanced to the peak of human physicality by an experimental serum and frozen in suspended animation before waking up in the modern world. Evans stated that since the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D. in Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), Rogers has been left to depend on his Avenger teammates without the structure of military life and is now \"looking to understand where he belongs, not just as a soldier, as Captain America, but as Steve Rogers, as a person.\" Evans said that he was able to maintain the strength he built up for Captain America: The Winter Soldier by working out up to an hour a day. Regarding Captain America's fighting style, Evans felt he did not want to take a step back from the skills shown in The Winter Soldier, making sure Rogers' fight style advanced, showing \"a consistent display of strength\", and having Rogers utilizing his environment.\nScarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff \/ Black Widow: An Avenger who formerly worked for S.H.I.E.L.D. as a highly trained spy. Producer Kevin Feige stated that more of the character's backstory is explored in the film. Johansson elaborated, \"In Avengers 2 we go back [...] we definitely learn more about Widow's backstory, and we get to find out how she became the person you see. All of these characters have deep, dark pasts, and I think that the past catches up to some of us a little bit.\" Regarding where the film picks up Widow's story, Johansson felt it was a continuation of what was seen for her character in The Winter Soldier, with the fact that \"'[Widow] never made an active choice. [She's] a product of other people's imposition.' That's going to catch up with her. That's bound to have a huge effect. There's got to be a result of that realization [...] You'll see her actively making some choices in her life, for better or worse.\" A mixture of close-ups, concealing costumes, stunt doubles, and visual effects were used to help hide Johansson's pregnancy during filming.\nJeremy Renner as Clint Barton \/ Hawkeye: An Avenger and master archer who previously worked as an agent for S.H.I.E.L.D. Whedon said that Hawkeye interacts more with the other characters in the film, as opposed to the first film where the character had been \"possessed pretty early by a bad guy and had to walk around all scowly.\" As the character did not appear in any other of Marvel's Phase Two films, Whedon stated Age of Ultron sheds light on to what the character was doing since the end of The Avengers. Renner described the character as \"kind of a loner\" and \"a team player only 'cause he sort of has to be. He's not really a company man. Captain America can be that guy. In [Age of Ultron] you'll understand why [Hawkeye] thinks the way he thinks.\"\nDon Cheadle as James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes \/ War Machine: An officer in the U.S. Air Force, later Avenger and Tony Stark's close personal friend who operates the War Machine armor.\nAaron Taylor-Johnson as Pietro Maximoff:The twin brother of Wanda and Avenger who can move at superhuman speed. Taylor-Johnson felt Pietro was defined by the fact that he and his sister were abandoned by their family, and they both had to grow up \"in Eastern Europe defending and looking out for themselves and each other,\" that they both look to the other for guidance. Taylor-Johnson also said that Quicksilver was \"very overprotective\" of Scarlet Witch and has \"real anger frustration\", which results in him being easily bored because of a short attention span. Feige stated exploring Quicksilver's relationship with his sister and his backstory growing up in Eastern Europe would help differentiate the character from Evan Peters' version in X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014). Taylor-Johnson stated that the running style for Quicksilver went through multiple iterations. Much of Taylor-Johnson's scenes were filmed outdoors to give \"life\" to his running, as opposed to running indoors in front of a green screen.\nElizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff:The twin sister of Pietro and Avenger who can engage in hypnosis and telekinesis. Olsen felt Wanda was \"overly stimulated\" rather than \"mentally insane\" because \"she has such a vast amount of knowledge that she's unable to learn how to control it. No one taught her how to control it properly [...] she can connect to this world and parallel worlds at the same time, and parallel times.\" Describing her character's mind control powers, Olsen said that the character is able to do more than manipulating someone's mind, with Wanda Maximoff able to \"feel and see what they feel and see\" by projecting visions that they have never seen. Olsen drew on her relationship with her older brother and her sisters to prepare for the role, as well as looking to the comics for inspiration. Olsen revealed that Whedon was inspired by dancers as a way to visually represent how the character moves. As such, Olsen mostly trained with a dancer in lieu of traditional stunt training. Olsen was signed for this film and another.\nPaul Bettany as J.A.R.V.I.S. and Vision: Bettany, who voiced J.A.R.V.I.S., Stark's AI companion in previous films, was cast again as the Vision, an android and later Avenger created by Ultron. Bettany stated that he was surprised when Whedon asked him if he wanted to be the Vision because once an actor has been cast as a particular character in the MCU, they usually are not cast as another. On what intrigued him about the Vision, Bettany said, \"The thing that appealed to me is that this sort of nascent creature being born, being both omnipotent and totally naive, the sort of danger of that and complex nature of a thing being born that is that powerful and that created in a second and the choices he makes morally are really complex and interesting. They've really managed to maintain all of that\". Bettany also stated that the Vision feels paternal and protective to a number of people in the film, particularly Scarlet Witch, and has the ability to change his density. Bettany did wire work for the part. Whedon stated he wanted to include the Vision in a second Avengers film before he signed onto the first film. Bettany's make-up, which consisted of a mix of face paint and prosthetics, took two hours to apply with make-up artists Jeremy Woodhead and Nik Williams citing the correct hue of the Vision's skin as the hardest thing to figure out. The prosthetics were ultimately replaced in post-production with CGI elements.\nCobie Smulders as Maria Hill: A former high-ranking S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who now works for Stark. Describing Hill's situation in the film, Smulders said that after The Winter Soldier, Hill does not \"really know who's a good guy and who's a bad guy and she's trying to figure out that throughout this film.\" She added, \"She's not getting any sleep. She's doing all the work. She doesn't have the kind of manpower that she had in S.H.I.E.L.D.,\" instead working for Tony Stark at the Avenger's headquarters \"trying to keep everything running as smoothly as possible [...] it's an entirely different vibe for her.\"\nAnthony Mackie as Sam Wilson \/ Falcon: A former pararescueman and later Avenger trained by the military in aerial combat using a specially designed wing pack and a friend of Steve Rogers. Discussing the relationship between Wilson and Rogers, Mackie said that the two characters have a mutual \"soldier respect\", which is explored in the film and in Captain America: Civil War (2016). Feige said that it was decided to reshoot the final scene of the film to incorporate the new Falcon suit designed for Ant-Man (2015), which was released after Age of Ultron, as Falcon was originally shot in his original suit from The Winter Soldier. Mackie stated he did not realize Wilson had become an Avenger until he watched the film at the premiere, as he was only given the script for the scenes he worked on.\nHayley Atwell as Peggy Carter: A retired officer with the Strategic Scientific Reserve and co-founder of S.H.I.E.L.D. who is a former love interest of Steve Rogers.\nIdris Elba as Heimdall: The all-seeing, all-hearing Asgardian sentry of the Bifr\u00f6st Bridge, based on the mythological deity of the same name.\nLinda Cardellini as Laura Barton: Hawkeye's wife.\nStellan Skarsg\u00e5rd as Erik Selvig: An astrophysicist and friend of Thor. Skarsg\u00e5rd said he was originally not supposed to appear in the film, but received a call because \"they'd written a couple of scenes, and I went and did them,\" not knowing if the scenes would appear in the final cut of the film.\nJames Spader as Ultron: An artificial intelligence repurposed by Tony Stark and Bruce Banner for a pilot peace program that is overwhelmed with a god complex and now desires to pacify the Earth by eradicating humanity. Director Joss Whedon stated that Spader was his \"first and only choice\" for the role, because of his \"hypnotic voice that can be eerily calm and compelling\" while also being very human and humorous. Feige clarified that Spader's face and body were motion captured \"to create a whole performance [...] We did not hire James Spader to do a robot voice.\" Extensive scans were taken of Spader's head and body in preparation for the role. About the character Whedon said, \"He's always trying to destroy the Avengers, goddamn it, he's got a bee in his bonnet. He's not a happy guy, which means he's an interesting guy. He's got pain. And the way that manifests is not going to be standard robot stuff.\" Whedon added that Ultron is \"not a creature of logic\u2014he's a robot who's genuinely disturbed. We're finding out what makes him menacing and at the same time endearing and funny and strange and unexpected, and everything a robot never is.\" Whedon compared Ultron to Frankenstein's monster, saying, \"It's our new Frankenstein myth [...] We create something in our own image and the thing turns on us. It has that pain of 'Well, why was I made? I want to kill Daddy.'\" Spader called the character \"self-absorbed\" and added, \"I think he sees the Avengers as being part of a problem, a more comprehensive problem in the world. He sees the world from a very strange, [biblical] point of view because he's brand new, he's very young [...] He's immature, and yet has knowledge of comprehensive, broad history and precedent, and he has created in a very short period of time a rather skewed worldview.\" Spader elaborates, \"He truly is an artificial intelligence with absolutely no censorship at all, no parameters really [...] he's got too much power, too much strength and speed and size, so he's a very dangerous child.\"\nSamuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury: The former director of S.H.I.E.L.D. who originally recruited the Avengers and continues to be a mentor and leader for the team. Jackson described the role as a cameo, saying the character didn't participate in the action scenes because \"There's not a lot I could do except shoot a gun.\"\nThomas Kretschmann and Henry Goodman reprise their roles as Baron Wolfgang von Strucker and Dr. List, Hydra leaders who specialize in human experimentation, advanced robotics, and artificial intelligence from Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Claudia Kim portrays Helen Cho, a world-renowned geneticist who helps the Avengers from her office in Seoul; Andy Serkis portrays Ulysses Klaue, a South-African black-market arms dealer, smuggler and gangster who is a former acquaintance from Stark's weapons-dealing days; and Julie Delpy appears as Madame B., who mentored Black Widow into becoming an assassin. Kerry Condon voices the artificial intelligence F.R.I.D.A.Y., a replacement for J.A.R.V.I.S., while Spader also voices Stark's Iron Legion droids. Josh Brolin makes an uncredited appearance during the mid-credits scene as Thanos, reprising his role from Guardians of the Galaxy (2014). Avengers co-creator Stan Lee makes a cameo appearance in the film as a military veteran who attends the Avengers' victory party. Tom Hiddleston was to reprise his role of Loki, but his scenes did not make the theatrical cut of the film.\n\nProduction\nDevelopment\nIn October 2011, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige said the studio was beginning to look at their Phase Two films, which would start with Iron Man 3 and would culminate in a second Avengers film. In March 2012, Joss Whedon, director of the first film, stated that he would want a sequel to be more small, personal, and painful; that is \"not just a rehash of what seemed to work the first time\", and with a theme full of originality to itself. Despite the production of the film becoming increasingly wider in scope, Feige maintained that this was not their intention, always looking to see where the team wanted to take the characters, over how to make it bigger than The Avengers. At the premiere of The Avengers, Feige said the studio had an option for Whedon to return as director. In May 2012, after the successful release of the first film, the Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger announced a sequel was in development. Most of the film's cast members were under contract to potentially appear in the sequel; however, Robert Downey Jr. was not, as his four-picture deal with Marvel expired after Iron Man 3.\nAt the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con, Whedon said he was undecided about directing. However, in August 2012, Iger announced that Whedon would return to write and direct the sequel and develop the Marvel television series, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., for ABC. Later in the month, Disney set a May 1, 2015, release date. Whedon said his return for a sequel \"wasn't a tough decision\"; he thought it was \"not going to happen\", but realized he \"desperately wanted to say more about these characters\" when he started considering it. Whedon said that they intended for the film's production to not be as rushed as the first one. In December 2012, Whedon stated that he had completed an outline for the film. In March 2013, Whedon said that he looked to The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and The Godfather Part II (1974) as inspirations.\nFeige revealed that Captain Marvel, who starred in her own MCU film in 2019, appeared in an early draft of the screenplay, but was removed since the character had not yet been cast, saying, \"It didn't feel like the time. We didn't want to introduce her fully formed flying in a costume before you knew who she was or how she came to be.\" Whedon went so far as to shoot visual effects plates for Captain Marvel to fly into Avengers Headquarters at the end of the film; those shots were reused; however, for Scarlet Witch instead. Feige also revealed that an early draft of the script had Hulk's Quinjet detected near Saturn at the end of the film, but it was finally decided to keep it Earth-based and leave his fate ambiguous in order to dispel rumors that a film based on the \"Planet Hulk\" comic storyline was in development, which Marvel Studios had no plans to adapt at the time. Marvel would later decide to adapt \"Planet Hulk\" for the film Thor: Ragnarok (2017), in which the Hulk is retroactively revealed to have left Earth after the events of Age of Ultron.\n\nPre-production\nBy April 2013, filming was scheduled to begin in early 2014 at Shepperton Studios in England. At the Hollywood, Los Angeles, premiere of Iron Man 3, Whedon said that he had completed a draft of the script, started the storyboard process, and met with actors. Whedon also mentioned that he wrote with Downey in mind and included a \"brother\/sister act\" from the comic books, later confirming that he was referring to Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. Whedon explained his rationale for including the characters in the film that \"their powers are very visually interesting\", with problems which Whedon \"had on the first one\" for strong powers; those powers are superspeed, and spells and telekinesis, respectively, which \"they can do that will help sort of keep it fresh\", though cautioned he was not throwing in more characters for the sake of doing that. Whedon stated that the twins allowed him to add more conflict, which do not like the United States and the Avengers, and \"the Avengers are like a world power, and not everybody's on board with the Avengers coming in and starting fights, even in the name of justice.\" Because Marvel Studios shared the film rights to Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch with 20th Century Fox and had to avoid conflict with Fox's X-Men films, Whedon introduced two important characters into the Marvel Cinematic Universe completely on his terms for the first time, which allowed him to connect their origin stories to the universe that they created and avoid the concept of mutants. Whedon relished at the storytelling opportunities by introducing a character with telepathic powers, explaining, \"it meant we could spend a little time inside the Avengers' heads\u2014either their past or their impressions of what's going on, or their fears, or all of the above.\" By May, Downey had entered negotiations to extend his contract with Marvel Studios and reprise his role as Iron Man in the film. A month later, Downey signed on to return for the then-untitled Avengers sequel, as well as a third Avengers film.\n\nAt the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con, Whedon announced the film would be subtitled Age of Ultron. Despite the subtitle, the film is not based on the 2013 comic book miniseries Age of Ultron. Feige explained that they simply liked the title Age of Ultron but the plot was taken from decades of Avengers story arcs. Whedon added that Ultron's origin would differ from his comics roots, and that Hank Pym would not be involved with Ultron's creation. Whedon disclosed that Edgar Wright had rights to the character first through his inclusion in Ant-Man, which was already in development. He also thought that Ultron needed to be conceived through the Avengers and since they already had Tony Stark and Bruce Banner on the team, it would not make sense to bring in a third scientist. Whedon also said the film would have a darker tone due to Ultron's involvement. The title of the film came as a surprise to many fans who were expecting Thanos, the mastermind behind the events of the first film, to be the main villain in the sequel, with Whedon saying, \"Thanos was never meant to be the next villain. He's always been the overlord of villainy and darkness.\" Commenting on finding the right balance between technology- and fantasy-based heroes in Avengers: Age of Ultron, Feige explained that Iron Man is a technology-based hero, and his films are always based on those; Thor is a fantasy-based hero introduced in the 2011 film of the same name, which also introduces Asgard, a fantastical realm in \"the more reality-based MCU\"; and finally, Ultron is \"clearly [...] come[s] out of technology,\" using tools that established in the franchise to construct Age of Ultron storyline.\nCasting continued into August 2013, with the announcement that James Spader would play Ultron. In November, Marvel confirmed that Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson would play the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, respectively. Taylor-Johnson had been in negotiations since as early as June, while Olsen's potential involvement was first reported in August. By the end of the year, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Samuel L. Jackson, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, and Cobie Smulders were confirmed to be returning to their roles from the first film, and Don Cheadle, who portrayed James Rhodes in the Iron Man films, had committed to a part in the film. In the early months of 2014, Thomas Kretschmann was cast as Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, Claudia Kim was cast in an unspecified role, and Paul Bettany, who voiced J.A.R.V.I.S. in previous MCU films, was cast as the Vision. Whedon said \"juggling\" all the characters in the film was \"a nightmare\"; he explained: \"They're very disparate characters. The joy of the Avengers is they really don't belong in the same room. It's not like the X-Men, who are all tortured by the same thing and have similar costumes. These guys are just all over the place. And so it's tough. Honestly, this is as tough as anything I've ever done.\"\nOn January 24, 2014, the Forte di Bard Association announced that filming would take place at Fort Bard in the Aosta Valley region of Italy in March 2014, as well as other locations in Aosta Valley including Aosta, Bard, Donnas, Pont-Saint-Martin, and Verr\u00e8s. The next month, the Gauteng Film Commission announced that action sequences would be filmed in Johannesburg, South Africa, and other locations in Gauteng, beginning in mid-February. A few weeks later Marvel announced that portions of the film would be shot in South Korea. Feige cited the nation's \"cutting-edge technology, beautiful landscapes and spectacular architecture\" as ideal for the film. The nation's capital, Seoul, and Seoul's surrounding province, Gyeonggi, were selected as filming locations, with South Korea's Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism reimbursing up to 30% of the studio's expenditures, as part of a state-funded incentive program.\n\nFilming\nFilming began on Tuesday, February 11, 2014, in Johannesburg, South Africa, having been postponed that Monday. Second unit crews shot action sequences without the main cast, to be used as background plates for scenes featuring the Hulk, in the Central Business District of Johannesburg for a period of two weeks. By mid-March, principal photography had begun at Shepperton Studios near London and was scheduled to film there for at least four months, under the working title After Party. Filming at Shepperton as well as other locations in England allowed Whedon to get a \"number of different looks and textures and moods\" to give the film a different palette and fresh aesthetic from its predecessor. Production designer Charles Wood built an enormous, new Avengers Tower set, one of the largest sets ever built for a Marvel film. The set featured multiple connected environments and levels. On March 22, production moved to Fort Bard, Italy and continued in the Aosta Valley region through March 28. The region doubled as the fictional Eastern European nation of Sokovia, with crews replacing local storefronts with Cyrillic script. Filming in South Korea began on March 30 on the Mapo Bridge, and continued through April 14 at various locations in Seoul, such as Cheongdam Bridge, Digital Media City, Gangnam Boulevard and road near Kaywon University of Art and Design in Uiwang. While in Seoul, the production was able to attach cameras to drones and race cars to get unique camera angles and footage. An artificial island on the Han River known as the Saebit Dungdungseom served as the headquarters of an IT institute featured in the film. Scenes involving Ultron's attack on parts of the city were shot in the Gangnam District.\nIn April, shooting began in Hawley Woods in Hampshire, England, and Hayley Atwell, who played Peggy Carter in previous MCU films, filmed scenes inside the Rivoli Ballroom in London while extras performed the Lindy Hop. That June, scenes were shot at the University of East Anglia in Norwich and at Dover Castle in Kent, with Dover Castle used for interior shots of Strucker's Hydra base in Sokovia. The next month, filming took place at a training facility for London's Metropolitan Police Service, which doubled as a city in Sokovia. Additional filming took place in Chittagong, Bangladesh, including the Chittagong Ship Breaking Yard, and in the state of New York. On August 6, Whedon announced on Twitter that he had completed principal photography on Avengers: Age of Ultron. Disney spent $330.6 million on Avengers: Age of Ultron from February 2013 to November 2014, but $50.7 million of this was offset by payments from the UK tax authority. A report on actual production costs for films from FilmL.A. Inc., indicated a gross budget of $444 million, with a net of $365 million for Avengers: Age of Ultron. This makes the film one of the most expensive films ever made.\nCinematographer Ben Davis, who also worked with Marvel on Guardians of the Galaxy, shot the film with a main unit of three Arri Alexa cameras. Davis said, \"Although the Alexa was Marvel's preferred camera, we weren't locked into that choice from the start. What wasn't negotiable was the fact that we were shooting digital: that's how Marvel shoots all of its films.\" Davis also used Blackmagic Design's Pocket Cinema Cameras to meet the needs of the second unit kit explaining, \"The second unit typically needs a fleet of smaller cameras that are less expensive and are rugged enough to handle the various trials by fire, as it were, that we throw at them.\" About the camera system, Whedon stated that this film was shot very differently from the first one; using many long lenses, and that he aimed to shoot the film almost like a documentary. To create the scenes depicting how Quicksilver views the world, scenes were shot with an ultra-high-speed camera and later combined with shots of Taylor-Johnson moving through the same scene at normal speed.\n\nPost-production\nIn June 2014, the IMAX Corporation announced that the IMAX release of the film would be converted to IMAX 3D. Following the completion of principal photography several more cast members were revealed including Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, Anthony Mackie, Idris Elba, and Tom Hiddleston, reprising their roles from previous MCU films. However, Hiddleston's scenes did not make the theatrical cut of the film, with Whedon saying what was shot \"didn't play\" and he did not want the film to feel \"overstuffed\". According to Hiddleston, \"In test screenings, audiences had overemphasized Loki's role, so they thought that because I was in it, I was controlling Ultron, and it was actually imbalancing people's expectations.\" Whedon later explained that Elba and Atwell appear in the film because of exploring the psyches of the Avengers from Scarlet Witch's power. In December 2014, Kim's role was revealed as Dr. Helen Cho. Additional scenes were scheduled to be filmed in January 2015 at Pinewood Studios. In February 2015, Marvel confirmed through promotional material that Serkis portrays Ulysses Klaue in the film. In early April 2015, Linda Cardellini and Julie Delpy were confirmed to be part of the film's cast. At the same time, Whedon stated that the film would not contain a post-credits scene, which had become customary for MCU films. Whedon tried to come up with a post-credit scene but felt that he could not top the \"Shawarma scene\" in The Avengers, explaining, \"It didn't seem to lend itself in the same way, and we wanted to be true to what felt right. The first rule of making a sequel is take the best moments and do something else. Don't do the Indiana Jones gun trick again differently. Just go somewhere else. Don't try to hit the same highs, because people will sense it.\" However, Feige clarified, \"There will be a tag [shortly after the credits start]. But there's not a post\u2013post\u2013credit scene.\"\nIn May 2015, Whedon revealed he was in conflict with Marvel executives and the film's editors about certain scenes in the film. The executives were not \"thrilled\" with the scenes at Hawkeye's farm or the dream sequences the Avengers experience because of Scarlet Witch. Also, Whedon had originally shot a much longer scene with Thor and Selvig in the cave but the final version is shorter as test audiences did not respond well to the original cut. In the scene, Thor would be possessed by a Norn, a goddess of destiny, while Selvig would quiz her about Thor's hallucination. Additionally, Whedon reiterated he had wanted to include Captain Marvel and Spider-Man at the end, but deals for each character (signing of an actress and a deal with Sony Pictures Entertainment, respectively) were not completed in time for their inclusion.\nThe film contains 3,000 visual effects shots, completed by ten different visual effects studios, including Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Trixter, Double Negative, Animal Logic, Framestore, Lola VFX, Territory, Perception, Method Studios, Luma Pictures, and The Third Floor. ILM opened a facility in London, citing Avengers: Age of Ultron as a catalyst for the expansion, and developed a new motion capture system for the film called Muse, which can better capture an actor's performance and combine different takes. About the motion capture process, Ruffalo called it \"more of a collaboration\" since the technology is advancing, with \"the face capture and the motion capture can now [being] put together, [allowing] you [to] get a lot more latitude as a performer [...] you're no longer constricted by the attributes that you have as a person: your age, or weight, or size. None of that matters anymore. And so there's this whole exciting place to go that is kind of unknown.\" Visual effects supervisor Christopher Townsend said that the visual effects team considered depicting the Hulk when manipulated by Wanda Maximoff as being grey skinned with red eyes, but eventually decided against it, as they did not want to confuse audiences who might associate it with \"Joe Fixit\", the grey Hulk from the comics.\n\nMethod Studios created the interior of the new Avengers training facility by digitally designing the training facility, extracting the characters from the original set and placing them into the new CG environment. Method also contributed to Iron Man's new Mark 45 suit and played a key role in creating Scarlet Witch's CG mind control effect. Following the trend in recent years, most of the computer screens in Stark's lab, Dr. Cho's laboratory, the Quinjet and other locations in the film were not added in post-production but were actually working screens on set, adding to the realism of the film and saving some on the post-production budget. London-based Territory Studio delivered the screen visuals filled with unique imagery and animations that matched the character using them. Perception worked on the main-on-end and main titles for the film. Before settling on the marble monument depiction for the main-on-end titles, Perception created three other versions, which were based on Ultron's hive mind ability from the film, \"renderings of power and pure energy\" inspired by classic comic panels, and classic moments for each character. The final design was inspired by war monuments such as the Iwo Jima memorial. For the main titles, Marvel wanted the typeface to be a direct continuation of the first film. Perception made the typeface a marble texture to mimic the main-on-end titles and changed the title's rotation (away from the camera instead of towards the camera in The Avengers), before \"Age of Ultron\" overtakes \"Avengers\" in a vibranium texture.\n\nMusic\nBrian Tyler signed on to compose the film's score in March 2014. He replaced Alan Silvestri, who composed the score for the first film, and Tyler's hiring marked his third collaboration with Marvel following Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World in 2013. Tyler said the score would pay homage to John Williams' music for Star Wars (1977), Superman (1978), and Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) while referencing the scores for the Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America films in order to create a similar musical universe, saying, \"That's the goal for sure. You have to build in nostalgia and do it upfront so you can relate to it.\" Danny Elfman also contributed music to the score, reprising Silvestri's theme from the first film to create a new hybrid theme. Hollywood Records released the album digitally on April 28, 2015, and in physical formats on May 19.\n\nMarketing\nPromotion\nAt the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con, Whedon introduced a teaser trailer for the film, which included a look at an Ultron helmet and a title treatment. Footage of the teaser, as well as a brief interview with Whedon, was made available as part of Iron Man 3's second screen companion app for its Blu-ray release on September 24, 2013. On March 18, 2014, ABC aired a one-hour television special titled, Marvel Studios: Assembling a Universe, which included a sneak peek of Avengers: Age of Ultron. The special debuted concept art for Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, as well as art of the Hulk fighting the \"Hulkbuster\" Iron Man suit. Harley-Davidson partnered with Marvel to provide their first electric motorcycle, Project LiveWire, for use by Black Widow in the film. As with previous films, Audi provided several vehicles for Age of Ultron and commercials promoting these vehicles. At the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con, the cast was introduced to promote the film, along with screening footage from the film. Avengers: Age of Ultron received the second most social media mentions at the convention, following Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), but had a higher intend-to-see response.\n\nThe first trailer was scheduled to premiere during the airing of an episode of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. on October 28, 2014. However, on October 22, the trailer leaked online, and within a few hours Marvel officially released the trailer on YouTube. Entertainment Weekly and The Hollywood Reporter noted the effective use of the song \"I've Got No Strings\" from Pinocchio (1940) in the trailer. Scott Mendelson of Forbes felt the trailer was \"such a textbook 'dark sequel' trailer that it borders on parody\" but said, \"it's a pretty spectacular piece of marketing, one that elevates itself both by the music choices and by James Spader's vocals as the title villain\". The trailer received 34.3 million global views in 24 hours, 26.2 million from Marvel's YouTube channel, which broke the previous record held by Iron Man 3 with 23.14 million views. In comparison, the original Avengers teaser received 20.4 million views in 24 hours after its debut. In response, Marvel agreed to air footage from Age of Ultron during the episode of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. that was originally scheduled to premiere the trailer. At the end of October, Marvel Comic's Editor-in-Chief Axel Alonso stated there were comic tie-in plans for the film.\nIn November 2014, ABC aired another one-hour television special titled Marvel 75 Years: From Pulp to Pop!, which featured behind the scenes footage of Age of Ultron. Also in November, an extended trailer debuted on Samsung Mobile's YouTube channel, featuring product placement for various Samsung devices. In December 2014, additional behind the scenes footage was released as a special feature on the Guardians of the Galaxy Blu-ray, highlighting the various filming locations for the film. That same month, ABC announced that an episode of Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. would tie-in to the events of the film. The episodes \"The Frenemy of My Enemy\" and \"The Dirty Half Dozen\" feature \"Easter eggs, plot threads and other connective tissue leading into the opening scene of Avengers: Age of Ultron\" while \"Scars\" explores the aftermath of the film.\nIn January 2015, a featurette focusing on Ultron was shown at Samsung's \"Night With Marvel\" event at the 2015 Consumer Electronics Show (CES). Also at CES, Samsung revealed a selection of hardware inspired by the Avengers films, as well as a simulation of Avengers Tower via its Gear VR virtual reality device. A second trailer premiered on ESPN on January 12, 2015, during the broadcast of the 2015 College Football Playoff National Championship. Mendelson enjoyed the trailer, but wished it did not reveal as many story elements as it did. However, he added, \"the marketing thus far [for the film] has been far superior to much of what sold The Avengers three years ago, both in terms of the specific footage and the artistic choices being made [...] I'm sold, and I imagine most of the general moviegoers are already onboard too.\"\nOn February 3, 2015, Marvel \"stealth released\" a one-shot digital-only tie-in comic, Avengers: Age of Ultron Prelude\u2014This Scepter'd Isle. Written by Will Corona Pilgrim and illustrated by Wellinton Alves, it reveals how Strucker came into possession of Loki's scepter and the origin of the Maximoff twins' abilities. At the end of the month, the film's official poster was revealed. Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter criticized it for its lack of originality, calling it \"pretty much the poster for the first Avengers movie, except with added flying robots in the background\" and the fact that it incorporated many of the same tropes the other MCU Phase Two film posters did. These included the hero(es) staring off camera; destruction in the background as well as something occurring in the sky; and poor Photoshop on the poster, highlighting the fact that each of the actors were obviously photographed separately and were later composited together into the poster. Mendelson agreed with many of McMillan's observations, and called the poster \"hilariously photoshopped\".\nThe final trailer was \"unlocked\" by fans on March 4, 2015, via the use of hashtags on Twitter, ahead of its broadcast debut during the series premiere of American Crime on March 5. Mendelson felt \"this [was] a fine final trailer, teasing what we already know, hinting at the scale and a few new action beats without telling us much we don't already know\" adding, \"Here we have the fourth and final Avengers: Age of Ultron trailer and we don't know all that much about what transpires in a moment-to-moment sense in the finished 150-minute feature. I have expressed my concern dating back to October that Marvel and Disney would release too many trailers and would by default give away too much plot and character information between October and May. But if this really is the final Avengers 2 trailer, then at least on the trailer front they have kept the film relatively unspoiled.\" A week after the final trailer debuted, Marvel revealed that the trailer had \"smashed records\" with over 35 million views.\nIn April 2015, members of the cast presented Downey with the MTV Generation Award at the 2015 MTV Movie Awards, along with debuting an exclusive clip from the film. On April 27, Downey and Renner along with executives from Marvel Entertainment rang the opening bell of the New York Stock Exchange in celebration of the film's theatrical release. Disney spent a total of $26.9 million on television advertisements for the film, from an estimated total marketing budget of $180 million.\n\nMerchandise\nIn January 2015, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and Traveller's Tales announced a Lego video game adaptation of the first film and Age of Ultron for release in late 2015 on a variety of video game consoles. In March 2015, Disney said it planned to broaden its merchandising strategy with Avengers: Age of Ultron by expanding the target demographics to women and to fans of the individual superheroes that make up the Avengers. Paul Gitter, senior vice president of Marvel licensing for Disney Consumer Products, said, \"For the first film, we primarily focused on the Avengers property and the group shots [...] Now we're broadening the line and scope to create skews that focus on the team and the individuals characters, as well.\" Disney Consumer Products partnered with Hasbro, Lego, Hot Wheels, and Funko for action figures, playsets, and other toys, and with Under Armour for apparel. Disney established new partnerships in the food and packaged-goods categories, including with Sage Fruit, ConAgra, Crunchpak, and Chobani. Walt Disney India's consumer products partnered with 50 brands to promote the film in India, considered the highest ever for any film\u2014Hollywood or Bollywood\u2014released in India (the previous record held by Ra.One (2011) had 25 partners). Some of the brands include Amazon India, toy retailer Hamleys India, online fashion store Myntra, Hero Cycles, Mountain Dew, Liberty Shoes, Tupperware, and Subway restaurants, among others. A virtual pinball table based on the film was released in April 2015 by Zen Studios.\n\nRelease\nTheatrical\nAvengers: Age of Ultron had its world premiere at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on April 13, 2015, and held its European premiere on April 21 at the Vue West End in London. The film was released in 11 territories on April 22, with its release jumping to 55% of its international market (44 countries) by the end of its first weekend, before releasing on May 1 in the United States, in 3D and IMAX 3D. In the United States, the film opened in 4,276 theaters, including 2,761 3D theaters, 364 IMAX, 400 premium large format, and 143 D-Box theaters. Many independent theater owners in Germany (approximately 700 screens) boycotted the film in response to Disney raising its rental fee from 47.7% to 53% of ticket sales. The owners felt that the \"increased fees, coupled with the cost of digitization, and rising staff and marketing costs may force some of them out of business.\" Avengers: Age of Ultron is part of Phase Two of the MCU.\nOn March 4, 2015, ticket pre-sales for the film began. Variety noted, \"The two-month gap between advance sales and the release is much wider than normal and reflects the heavy fan anticipation\" for the film.\n\nHome media\nAvengers: Age of Ultron was released on digital download by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on September 8, and on Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, and DVD on October 2. The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, and a blooper reel. The film was also collected in a 13-disc box set, titled \"Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Two Collection\", which includes all of the Phase Two films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and was released on December 8. In July 2015, Whedon stated that he did not intend on releasing a director's cut of Avengers: Age of Ultron because despite the film's complexity, he was satisfied with the theatrical version and did not think it needed to be tweaked. Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the film on Ultra HD Blu-ray on August 14, 2018.\nIn September 2014, TNT acquired the US cable broadcast rights, for broadcast two years after its theatrical release.\n\nReception\nBox office\nAvengers: Age of Ultron grossed $459 million in the United States and Canada, and $943.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $1.403 billion, becoming the fifth-highest-grossing film at the time and the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2015. Avengers: Age of Ultron's worldwide opening of $392.5 million was the seventh-largest ever. The film set a worldwide IMAX opening-weekend record with $25.2 million (previously held by The Dark Knight Rises (2012)) and also broke the record for the fastest movie to make over $40 million in IMAX theaters, doing so in 12 days. According to some analysts, the opening weekend box office gross was lower than expected because of the weekend's featured boxing match between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao. Deadline Hollywood calculated the film's net profit as $382.32 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it fourth on their list of 2015's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".\nOn May 15, 2015, Avengers: Age of Ultron became the twenty-first film in cinematic history, the third Marvel Studios film, and the eighth film distributed by Disney to cross the $1 billion threshold at the box office.\n\nUnited States and Canada\nAvengers: Age of Ultron earned $84.46 million on its opening day, marking the biggest opening day for a superhero film and the second-biggest opening and second-biggest single-day gross, behind Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2 (2011) ($91.7 million). The film's Friday gross included $27.6 million from Thursday night, which began at 7 p.m., and was the sixth-highest ever for Thursday preview earnings and the highest among Marvel films. The film totaled $191.3 million in its opening weekend, the third-highest gross behind Jurassic World (2015) ($208.8 million) and The Avengers ($207.4 million). It also saw the second-highest IMAX opening weekend total with $18 million (behind The Dark Knight Rises), a record $13.5 million from premium large format theaters and the highest share for the first weekend in May, accounting for 85% of the top twelve box office total earnings (previously held by Spider-Man 3 (2007)). Of those in attendance the first weekend, 59% were male, 41% were female and 59% were over the age of 25.\nIn its second weekend, the film fell 59%, earning $77.7 million, which was the second-biggest second weekend gross behind The Avengers' $103 million (both were surpassed a month later by Jurassic World's $106.6 million). It holds the record for the second-biggest loss between first and second weekends with $113.6 million, only behind Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2's $121 million loss between its first and second weekends in 2011. It became the third-highest-grossing film of 2015.\n\nOther territories\nAvengers: Age of Ultron earned $200.2 million in its first weekend from 44 countries, opening in first in all, which was 44% above its predecessor's opening. Additionally, the film saw the largest non-China international IMAX opening with $10.4 million. The top earning countries were South Korea ($28.2 million), the United Kingdom ($27.3 million), and Russia ($16.2 million). The film broke records in many countries, including opening-day records in Mexico ($6.8 million), the Philippines ($1.6 million), and Indonesia ($900,000); opening-weekend records in Mexico ($25.5 million), Russia and the CIS ($16.2 million), Hong Kong ($6.4 million), and the Philippines ($7.7 million); and highest opening weekend for a superhero film in the United Kingdom ($27.3 million), Germany ($9.3 million), Sweden, Norway, and the Netherlands.\nIn the United Kingdom, where Age of Ultron was filmed, it earned $5.4 million on its opening day and $27.3 million during the weekend, setting an opening-weekend record for a superhero film, Marvel's biggest opening in Britain, the biggest April opening, and the eighth-biggest debut. It also set the best single-day earning for a Disney and superhero film with its $9.4 million haul on Saturday. In South Korea, also where part of the film was shot, the film earned $4.9 million on its opening day and $28.2 through the weekend. It held the record for advance-ticket sales rate, accounting for 96% of tickets reserved, breaking Transformers: Dark of the Moon's (2011) record of 94.6% in 2011, the widest release ever, across 1,826 screens, also breaking Dark of the Moon's 1,420 screens, and the fastest imported film to surpass one million admissions, doing so in two days; it topped the box office for three consecutive weekends, and became the biggest Disney\/Marvel release as well as the second-biggest Western film in the country. The Chinese opening scored the biggest weekday opening day, as well as the biggest Disney\/Marvel opening, with $33.9 million, and the second-biggest six-day start with $156.3 million (behind Furious 7 (2015)) of which $17.5 million came from IMAX theaters\u2014the biggest ever. Age of Ultron also opened at number one in Japan in early July 2015 with $6.5 million, the highest opening weekend for an MCU release. As of March 10, 2019, it is the ninth-highest-grossing film, and the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2015. Its largest markets were China ($240.1 million), the United Kingdom ($75.5 million), and South Korea ($72.3 million).\n\nCritical response\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 76%, with an average score of 6.8\/10, based on 378 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Exuberant and eye-popping, Avengers: Age of Ultron serves as an overstuffed but mostly satisfying sequel, reuniting its predecessor's unwieldy cast with a few new additions and a worthy foe.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 66 out of 100 based on 49 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, and those at PostTrak gave the film a 90% overall positive score and a 79% recommend.\nTodd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter said, \"Avengers: Age of Ultron succeeds in the top priority of creating a worthy opponent for its superheroes and giving the latter a few new things to do, but this time the action scenes don't always measure up.\" Scott Foundas of Variety wrote, \"If this is what the apotheosis of branded, big-studio entertainment has come to look like in 2015, we could be doing much worse. Unlike its title character, Age of Ultron most definitely has soul.\" Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times and giving the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, Richard Roeper said, \"Some day, an Avengers film might collapse under the weight of its own awesomeness. I mean, how many times can they save the world? But this is not that day.\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote, \"Age of Ultron is a whole summer of fireworks packed into one movie. It doesn't just go to 11, it starts there. [Joss Whedon] takes a few wrong turns, creating a jumble when the action gets too thick. But he recovers like a pro, devising a spectacle that's epic in every sense of the word.\" Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com gave the film three out of four stars, stating that despite being \"bigger, louder, and more disjointed\" than its predecessor, \"it's also got more personality\u2014specifically Whedon's\u2014than any other film in the now seven-year-old franchise.\" Helen O'Hara of Empire praised the interactions between the characters, the action set-pieces and Whedon's ability as a director in her review, stating that the film \"redefines the scale we can expect from our superheroes.\"\nConversely, Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said, \"Although this movie is effective moment to moment, very little of it lingers in the mind afterward. The ideal vehicle for our age of immediate sensation and instant gratification, it disappears without a trace almost as soon as it's consumed.\" Scott Mendelson of Forbes said, \"Avengers: Age of Ultron plays like an obligation, a box to be checked off on a list before all parties move onto the things they really want to do.\" Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote, \"This Avengers doesn't always pop the way that the first one sometimes did, partly because its villain isn't as memorable, despite Mr. Spader's silky threat.\" Camilla Long of The Sunday Times remarked, \"Two hours of boredom and boobs add up to a sorry basis for the new Avengers.\" Much like the release of Guardians of the Galaxy, the film received mixed reviews upon release in China, due to poor translations. The translations, which were said to be too literal, were thought \"to have been done by Google Translate.\"\n\nAccolades\nSequels\nAvengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame were directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, from a script by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. Infinity War was released on April 27, 2018, followed by Endgame on April 26, 2019. Much of the cast returns for the two films, with additional cast and characters joining from other MCU films.\n\nSee also\n\"What If...

Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the sequel to The Avengers (2012) and Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), and the 19th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the film features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Don Cheadle, Tom Holland, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright, Dave Bautista, Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Josh Brolin, and Chris Pratt. In the film, the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy attempt to stop Thanos from collecting the six powerful Infinity Stones as part of his quest to kill half of all life in the universe.\nThe film was announced in October 2014 as Avengers: Infinity War \u2013 Part 1. The Russo brothers came on board to direct in April 2015, and a month later, Markus and McFeely signed on to write the script for the film, which draws inspiration from Jim Starlin's 1991 comic book The Infinity Gauntlet and Jonathan Hickman's 2013 comic book Infinity. In 2016, Marvel shortened the title to Avengers: Infinity War. Filming began in January 2017 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, with a large cast consisting mostly of actors reprising their roles from previous MCU films, including Brolin as Thanos. The production lasted until July 2017, shooting back-to-back with a direct sequel, Avengers: Endgame (2019). Additional filming took place in Scotland, the Downtown Atlanta area, and New York City. With an estimated budget of $325\u2013400 million, the film is one of the most expensive films ever made.\nAvengers: Infinity War premiered at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on April 23, 2018, and was released in the United States on April 27, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. The film received praise for Brolin's performance and the Russo brothers' direction, as well as the visual effects, action sequences, dark tone, emotional weight and musical score. It was a major box-office success, being the fourth film and the first superhero film to gross over $2 billion worldwide, breaking numerous box office records, and becoming the highest-grossing film of 2018 and the fourth-highest-grossing film at the time of its release both worldwide and in the United States and Canada. It received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 91st Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. The sequel, Avengers: Endgame, was released in April 2019.\n\nPlot\nHaving acquired the Power Stone\u2014one of six Infinity Stones\u2014from the planet Xandar, Thanos and his lieutenants\u2014Ebony Maw, Cull Obsidian, Proxima Midnight, and Corvus Glaive\u2014intercept the spaceship carrying the survivors of Asgard's destruction. After subduing Thor, Thanos extracts the Space Stone from the Tesseract, overpowers the Hulk, and kills Loki. Thanos also kills Heimdall after he sends Hulk to Earth using the Bifr\u00f6st. Thanos and his lieutenants leave, destroying the ship.\nHulk crash-lands in the Sanctum Sanctorum in New York City, reverting to the form of Bruce Banner. He warns Stephen Strange and Wong about Thanos's plan to destroy half of all life in the universe, and they recruit Tony Stark. Maw and Obsidian arrive to retrieve the Time Stone from Strange, drawing Peter Parker's attention. Maw, unable to take the Time Stone due to Strange's enchantment, captures him. Stark and Parker sneak aboard Maw's spaceship while Wong stays behind to guard the Sanctum.\nThe Guardians of the Galaxy respond to the Asgardian ship's distress call and rescue Thor. Thor surmises that Thanos is after the Reality Stone, which Taneleer Tivan possesses on Knowhere. He travels with Rocket and Groot to Nidavellir to enlist the dwarf king Eitri's aid in creating the battle-axe Stormbreaker. Peter Quill, Gamora, Drax, and Mantis travel to Knowhere, finding Thanos already has the Reality Stone. Thanos kidnaps Gamora, who discloses the Soul Stone's location to save Nebula from torture. On Vormir, the Stone's keeper, Red Skull, tells Thanos that he can only acquire it by sacrificing someone he loves. Thanos sacrifices Gamora, earning the Stone.\nMidnight and Glaive ambush Wanda Maximoff and Vision in Edinburgh to retrieve the Mind Stone in Vision's forehead. Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, and Sam Wilson rescue them and they take shelter with James Rhodes and Banner at the Avengers Compound. Vision asks Wanda to destroy him and the Mind Stone to keep it from Thanos, but Wanda refuses. Rogers suggests they travel to Wakanda, which he believes has the resources to remove the Stone without killing Vision.\nNebula escapes captivity and asks the remaining Guardians to meet her on Thanos's destroyed homeworld, Titan. Stark and Parker kill Maw and rescue Strange. The trio crash-lands on Titan, where they meet Quill, Drax, and Mantis. Using the Time Stone, Strange views millions of possible futures, seeing only one in which the Avengers win. The group formulates a plan to subdue Thanos and remove the Infinity Gauntlet, with which he safely houses and wields the Stones. Thanos appears, justifying his plans as necessary to guarantee the survival of an overpopulated universe. Nebula arrives soon after and helps the others subdue Thanos, but then deduces that Thanos has killed Gamora. Enraged, Quill attacks Thanos, inadvertently allowing him to break the group's hold and overpower them. Thanos grievously wounds Stark, but Strange offers the Time Stone in exchange for sparing Stark's life.\nIn Wakanda, Rogers reunites with Bucky Barnes before Thanos' army invades. The Avengers, along with T'Challa and the Wakandan forces, mount a defense while Shuri works to extract the Mind Stone from Vision. Unable to summon the Hulk after losing to Thanos, Banner fights in Stark's Hulkbuster armor. Thor, Rocket, and Groot arrive to reinforce the Avengers. Together they kill Midnight, Obsidian, and Glaive, and rout Thanos's army. Shuri cannot complete the extraction before Thanos himself arrives on the field, slowed only briefly by Banner, Rogers, T'Challa, Wilson, Rhodes, Barnes, Okoye, Romanoff, and Groot. Vision convinces a reluctant Wanda to destroy him and the Mind Stone, but Thanos uses the Time Stone to reverse her actions, rip the stone from Vision's forehead, and complete the Gauntlet. Although Thor severely wounds Thanos with Stormbreaker, Thanos activates the completed Gauntlet by snapping his fingers before teleporting away.\nHalf of all life across the universe disintegrates, including Barnes, T'Challa, Groot, Wanda, Wilson, Mantis, Drax, Quill, Strange, Parker, Maria Hill, and Nick Fury, the last of whom sends an emergency signal on a modified pager before disintegrating. Stark and Nebula remain stranded on Titan while Banner, M'Baku, Okoye, Rhodes, Rocket, Rogers, Romanoff, and Thor are left on the Wakandan battlefield. Meanwhile, Thanos watches a sunrise on a remote planet.\n\nCast\nRobert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark \/ Iron Man: The benefactor of the Avengers who is a self-described genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist with electromechanical suits of armor of his own making. Co-director Joe Russo explained that Stark \"senses this greater threat approaching, so he is doing everything in his power to keep the Earth safe\". Downey added that Stark has smaller goals than in previous films.\nChris Hemsworth as Thor: An Avenger and the king of Asgard, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name. Joe Russo stated that Thor's storyline picks up after the events of Thor: Ragnarok (2017), which finds him in a \"very profound\", \"very interesting place\" with \"real emotional motivation\". At the recommendation of Hemsworth, writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely consulted Thor: Ragnarok director Taika Waititi and screenwriter Eric Pearson to help carry over the comedic and tragic elements of the re-toned Thor from that film. Joe Russo said that Thor has \"the driving hero's arc of the movie which stands in direct opposition to Thanos' argument\" and would have been the main protagonist of the film had Thor killed Thanos.\nMark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner \/ Hulk: An Avenger and genius scientist who, because of exposure to gamma radiation, typically transforms into a monster when enraged or agitated. Banner spends the film trying to reintegrate with the Avengers and \"impress upon everybody how dangerous Thanos is\". Joe Russo felt the Hulk refusing to appear for much of the film was only partially because he was scared, but also because he realizes that \"Banner only wants Hulk for fighting. I think he's had enough of saving Banner's ass\". Russo added that this was \"really reflective of the journey from Ragnarok [...] [where] these two characters are constantly in conflict with each other over control\". Banner's appearance in the film continues a story arc for the character that was established in Thor: Ragnarok and concludes in Avengers: Endgame, with the difference between Hulk and Banner \"starting to blur a little bit\". Ruffalo described Hulk in Infinity War as having the mental capacity of a five-year-old.\nChris Evans as Steve Rogers \/ Captain America: The fugitive leader of the non-regulation faction of Avengers. A World War II veteran, he was enhanced to the peak of human physicality by an experimental serum and frozen in suspended animation before waking up in the modern world. Joe Russo said after the events of Captain America: Civil War (2016), Rogers struggles with the conflict between his responsibility to himself and his responsibility to others. The character embodies the \"spirit\" of the comic book identity Nomad in the film, and receives new vibranium gauntlets from Shuri to replace his old shield. An early draft of the film had Rogers first appearing at the end of the film to save Vision from Corvus Glaive in Wakanda. Markus and McFeely were called \"insane\" for waiting that long to introduce Rogers into the film and ultimately conceded it was \"not [a] satisfying\" approach.\nScarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff \/ Black Widow: A highly trained spy, member of Rogers' faction of Avengers, and former agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Johansson said that Romanoff's situation following Captain America: Civil War has been \"a dark time. I wouldn't say that my character has been particularly hopeful, but I think she's hardened even more than she probably was before.\"\nBenedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Stephen Strange: A former neurosurgeon who, after a car accident that led to a journey of healing, discovered the hidden world of magic and alternate dimensions and became a Master of the Mystic Arts. Markus and McFeely described Strange as \"[ending] up being the reasonable adult in the room\" with the \"widest perspective available\". Julian \"JayFunk\" Daniels once again assisted Cumberbatch with his finger-tutting movements.\nDon Cheadle as James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes \/ War Machine: An officer in the U.S. Air Force and Avenger who operates the War Machine armor. Following his paralysis during the events of Civil War, Rhodes is given an apparatus by Stark to walk again, although he is reluctant to don his War Machine armor and rejoin the Avengers due to his injury. Cheadle believed that Rhodes is \"negotiating this reunion and his rejoining this team\". He also explained that Rhodes' relationship with Stark \"deepened\" from his accident, saying, \"I think Tony feels somewhat responsible and culpable in a way. But again, he's always had my back in a way that only he could really have\".\nTom Holland as Peter Parker \/ Spider-Man: A teenager, Avenger and Stark's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who received spider-like abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider. Downey helped coach Holland through his death scene, which was not as drawn out in the script.\nChadwick Boseman as T'Challa \/ Black Panther: The king of the African nation of Wakanda who gained his enhanced strength by ingesting the Heart-Shaped Herb. Boseman, along with the other actors from Black Panther (2018) portraying Wakandans, improvised their war chants on set ahead of the battle in Wakanda. Despite both Black Panther and Infinity War filming at the same time, the Russos were not aware of the chants, as they had not yet seen footage from Black Panther, and felt the moment was \"incredibly cool\".\nPaul Bettany as Vision: An android and Avenger created using the artificial intelligence J.A.R.V.I.S., Ultron, and the Mind Stone. Anthony Russo called Vision \"a living MacGuffin\"; his life being in direct conflict with Thanos' quest, which \"raises the stakes\".\nElizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff: A member of Rogers' faction of Avengers who can harness magic and engage in hypnosis and telekinesis.\nAnthony Mackie as Sam Wilson \/ Falcon: A member of Rogers' faction of Avengers and former pararescueman trained by the military in aerial combat using a specially designed wing pack.\nSebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes \/ Winter Soldier: An enhanced soldier and Rogers' ally and best friend who reemerged as a brainwashed assassin after being thought to have been killed in action during World War II. Barnes, formerly known as the Winter Soldier, is given the name White Wolf by the people of Wakanda, who helped remove his Hydra programming.\nTom Hiddleston as Loki: Thor's adopted brother, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name. Hiddleston knew about Loki's death in Infinity War prior to production of Thor: Ragnarok after meeting the Russos in May 2016, with his death being the first scene of the film that the Russos had conceptualized. Hiddleston's knowledge of Loki's fate in Infinity War influenced his portrayal in Ragnarok. On Loki's final moments, Hiddleston believed it was \"very powerful\" that Loki calls himself \"Odinson\", as it was a moment that \"closes the whole journey of Loki\", while his death \"takes the stakes up dramatically\", establishing the threat of Thanos.\nIdris Elba as Heimdall: The all-seeing, all-hearing Asgardian and former sentry of the Bifr\u00f6st Bridge, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name.\nPeter Dinklage as Eitri: King of the Dwarves of Nidavellir, and weaponsmith, based on the Norse mythological dwarf of the same name.\nBenedict Wong as Wong: A Master of the Mystic Arts, tasked with protecting some of Kamar-Taj's most valuable relics and books.\nPom Klementieff as Mantis: A member of the Guardians with empathic powers.\nKaren Gillan as Nebula: An adopted daughter of Thanos who was raised with Gamora as siblings.\nDave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer: A member of the Guardians and warrior in search of vengeance against Thanos for killing his family. At the end of each day of filming, Bautista would have to sit in a sauna to remove his makeup.\nZoe Salda\u00f1a as Gamora: A member of the Guardians who is an orphan from an alien world and was subsequently raised by Thanos, and is seeking redemption for her past crimes. Ariana Greenblatt portrays a young Gamora.\nVin Diesel as Groot: A member of the Guardians who is a tree-like humanoid. Executive producer James Gunn explained that Groot is still an adolescent in the film, in the same state of growth seen in one of the post-credit scenes in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017). Terry Notary provided motion capture for Groot, and said the character is \"coming of age, so you'll see the teenager find a mentor to look up to and to model himself after\".\nBradley Cooper as Rocket: A member of the Guardians who is a genetically engineered raccoon-based bounty hunter, mercenary, and master of weapons and battle tactics. Sean Gunn was again the stand-in for Rocket during filming, with his acting and expressions serving as motion reference for the character.\nGwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts: Stark's fianc\u00e9e and the CEO of Stark Industries. Downey felt that \"Pepper remains the heart of the [Iron Man] story\", which was not a focal point in some of the preceding films with Stark. Downey continued that \"we wanted to get back to that reality. Not just for them, but let's really see how that can add to the something-worth-fighting-for of it all\".\nBenicio del Toro as Taneleer Tivan \/ The Collector: One of the Elders of the Universe who is an obsessive keeper of the largest collection of interstellar fauna, relics, and species of all manner in the galaxy.\nJosh Brolin as Thanos: An intergalactic warlord from Titan who seeks all six Infinity Stones to destroy half of all life for the sake of \"re-balanc[ing] the universe\". Producer Kevin Feige added that Thanos believes the universe is becoming over-populated, which led to the destruction of his home moon Titan and is something he vowed not to let happen again, and also said \"you could almost go so far as to say he is the main character of\" the film. McFeely shared this sentiment, describing the film as his \"hero journey\" in addition to being the film's protagonist, stating, \"Part of that is the things that [mean] the most to him. We wanted to show that. It wasn't just power; it wasn't just an ideal; it was people\". Brolin likened Thanos to \"the Quasimodo of this time\" and the novel Perfume, since Thanos was born deformed and considered a \"freak\" on Titan, while Joe Russo would reference The Godfather (1972) for Brolin at times, which Brolin felt helped \"to emotionalize the whole thing\". Brolin further added that he preferred playing Thanos over Cable in Deadpool 2 (2018) because of the amount of work that went into creating the character. Thanos does not wear armor for most of the film, which is symbolic of his growing power as he collects the Infinity Stones. In addition to voicing for the character, Brolin performed motion capture on set.\nChris Pratt as Peter Quill \/ Star-Lord: The half-human, half-Celestial leader of the Guardians who was abducted from Earth as a child and raised by a group of alien thieves and smugglers called the Ravagers. Pratt described his role in the film as a \"guest star\" appearance and said \"you get to be a little more vibrant; a little more irreverent; a little bit more colorful if you want it to be\".\nAdditionally, several other actors reprise their MCU roles: Danai Gurira as Okoye, the head of the Dora Milaje; Letitia Wright as T'Challa's sister Shuri; William Hurt as Thaddeus Ross, the U.S. Secretary of State; Kerry Condon as the voice of Stark's AI F.R.I.D.A.Y.; Winston Duke as M'Baku, the leader of Wakanda's mountain tribe the Jabari; Florence Kasumba as Ayo, a member of the Dora Milaje; Jacob Batalon as Parker's friend Ned; Isabella Amara as Parker's classmate Sally; Tiffany Espensen as Parker's classmate Cindy; and Ethan Dizon as Parker's classmate Tiny. Samuel L. Jackson and Cobie Smulders make uncredited cameos as Nick Fury and Maria Hill, the former director and deputy director of S.H.I.E.L.D., respectively, in the film's post-credits scene.\nThanos' henchmen, known collectively in the comics as the Black Order and in the film as the \"Children of Thanos\", include Terry Notary as Cull Obsidian, Tom Vaughan-Lawlor as Ebony Maw, Carrie Coon as Proxima Midnight, and Michael James Shaw as Corvus Glaive. The foursome provided voices and motion-capture performances on set for their characters. As Coon was pregnant during filming, she mainly did facial capture for Proxima Midnight with some motion-capture, with stuntwoman Monique Ganderton standing-in and providing the rest on set. Ebony Maw's look was inspired by the Marvel Comics character Mephisto, who appeared in the Infinity Gauntlet storyline.\nRoss Marquand voices Johann Schmidt \/ Red Skull, the \"Stonekeeper\" and former Nazi commander of Hydra during World War II. Marquand replaces Hugo Weaving, who had expressed reluctance to reprise the character from Captain America: The First Avenger (2011). Red Skull was created through CGI and portrayed with stand-ins on set. Avengers co-creator Stan Lee makes a cameo appearance in the film as Parker's school bus driver, while screenwriter Stephen McFeely cameos as Secretary Ross' aide. Kenneth Branagh, the director of Thor (2011), voices an Asgardian distress caller in an uncredited cameo. David Cross was invited to make a cameo appearance as Tobias F\u00fcnke, his character from the television sitcom Arrested Development, which the Russo brothers had previously worked on; this was prevented by a scheduling conflict, but F\u00fcnke still appears in the film as a specimen in the Collector's collection, played by an uncredited extra. Executive producer Jon Favreau was to reprise his role as Happy Hogan, while co-director Joe Russo had a cameo appearance as a paparazzi photographer, but this scene did not make the theatrical cut of the film.\n\nProduction\nIn October 2014, Marvel Studios announced a two-part sequel to Avengers: Age of Ultron, titled Avengers: Infinity War. Part 1 was scheduled to be released on May 4, 2018, with Part 2 scheduled for May 3, 2019. Marvel's plan was to film both parts of Infinity War back-to-back. Anthony and Joe Russo were hired as directors of these films in April 2015. The next month, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely signed on to write the screenplays for both parts of the film, which drew inspiration from Jim Starlin's 1991 The Infinity Gauntlet comic and Jonathan Hickman's 2013 Infinity comic. Anthony Russo added the film was inspired by 1990s heist films, with Thanos \"on a smash-and-grab\" to acquire all of the Infinity Stones. Producer Kevin Feige said these were titled as two parts of a single film because of the shared elements between them, but he felt they would be \"two distinct\" projects, not one story split across two films. The Russos decided in May 2016 to retitle the two films to remove this misconception; Marvel simply shortened the first as Avengers: Infinity War that July.\nPrincipal photography began on January 23, 2017, under the working title Mary Lou, at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, with Trent Opaloch as director of photography. Infinity War, along with Avengers: Endgame, were shot using ARRI Alexa IMAX 2D cameras, thus marking the first time that a Hollywood feature film was shot entirely with IMAX digital cameras. In early February, Marvel confirmed the involvement of Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark \/ Iron Man, Chris Pratt as Peter Quill \/ Star-Lord, and Tom Holland as Peter Parker \/ Spider-Man in the film. Additional filming took place in Scotland beginning in February 2017. The filming occurred in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and the Scottish Highlands, with studio work taking place at Wardpark Studios in Cumbernauld. In late June 2017, filming occurred in Downtown Atlanta, as well as Atlanta's Central Park in early July, before moving to Queens, New York in the middle of the month. Filming concluded on July 14, 2017. For the film's final scene, where Thanos settles in a nipa hut, the filmmakers worked with Thailand-based studio Indochina Productions to acquire footage of the Banaue Rice Terraces at Ifugao, Philippines.\nLater in July 2017, Joe Russo stated there were a couple of unfinished scenes for Infinity War that would be shot \"in the next few months\". In early March 2018, Disney moved the release of Infinity War in the United States to April 27, 2018, to have it be released the same weekend as some of its international markets. Visual effects for the film were created by Industrial Light & Magic, Framestore, Method Studios, Weta Digital, DNEG, Cinesite, Digital Domain, Rise, Lola VFX, and Perception. With an estimated budget in the range of $325\u2013400 million, it is one of the most expensive films ever made. Evans and Hemsworth both earned $15 million for the film.\n\nMusic\nIn June 2016, Alan Silvestri, who composed the score for The Avengers, was revealed to be returning to score both Infinity War and Endgame. Silvestri recorded his score from January 2018 to late March, and found working on the film to be \"a really different experience than anything I'd done before, especially in regard to the approach and balancing quick shifts in tone\". Ludwig G\u00f6ransson's theme from Black Panther is used in the film. Hollywood Records and Marvel Music released regular and deluxe soundtrack albums digitally on April 27, 2018, with physical releases on May 18. The deluxe edition featured some extended and additional tracks.\n\nMarketing\nIn May 2017, Robert Downey Jr. and his philanthropic organization Random Act Funding partnered with Omaze for a contest in which a randomly chosen winner from those that donated would receive an Infinity War set visit. A life-sized statue of Thanos, created by Legacy Effects, was on display at D23 Expo 2017, alongside statues of the Black Order \/ \"Children of Thanos\": Corvus Glaive, Proxima Midnight, Ebony Maw, and Cull Obsidian. Additionally, Feige, Joe Russo, Downey, Brolin, Bettany, Olsen, Klementieff, Gillan, Bautista, Cheadle, Mackie, Cumberbatch, Stan, Holland, Boseman, Ruffalo, and Hemsworth appeared at D23 Expo to present a clip highlighting the 10 years of MCU films, along with footage from Infinity War. The footage, which was screened exclusively for the panel, received strong audience reaction, with fans \"literally on their feet and jumping as the footage played\". Julia Alexander of Polygon said there was \"quite a bit happening\" in the footage and it \"finally feels like Marvel has made the movie it always wanted to\u2014and the one we've always wanted to see.\" CinemaBlend's Eric Eisenberg said the footage left him \"literally shaking\", with the film looking \"like it could be one of the most epic blockbusters ever created\". Haleigh Foutch for Collider described it as \"dark and dramatic, and utterly epic. It's clear Marvel is trying to do something different here [...] to pay off a decade's worth of narrative and world-building. While it's impossible to tell from two minutes work of footage, it certainly looks like that gamble paid off\". The D23 footage was also shown at the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con. After the two convention presentations, Avengers: Infinity War generated over 90,000 new conversations on social media from July 17 to 23, the third-most during that time period behind Thor: Ragnarok and Justice League (2017), according to Comscore and its PreAct service. Infinity War stayed in third the following week, with over 41,000 new social media conversations, behind Ragnarok and It (2017). By the week of October 16, Infinity War had generated over 679,000 total social media conversations.\nTo promote the film's first teaser trailer, Marvel released a compilation video of some of its previous trailers since Iron Man (2008), \"paired with fan reaction videos to those trailers\". The first teaser for Avengers: Infinity War debuted on Good Morning America on November 29, 2017. Josh Spiegel of The Hollywood Reporter said, \"The most important part of the trailer is how it carefully, deliberately introduces the notion that the Infinity War films are going to function as a passing of the torch, from one set of Avengers to a newer group\". Scott Mendelson, writing for Forbes, noted that even though the trailer was not much different from the convention footage screened earlier in the year, it was \"damn impressive.\" Additionally, the trailer had an \"excellent effect\", using the \"Avengers Initiative speech\" by Nick Fury and the \"Avengers theme\" by Alan Silvestri from The Avengers. Conversely to Mendelson, Alexander commented on the different marketing strategy for the film between the convention footage scenes and the trailer scenes, feeling the \"two couldn't be more different\". She said the convention footage (intended to please the crowd who were \"jittery with anticipation\") was released between Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and Thor: Ragnarok, and heavily focused Thor and the Guardians, while the trailer (designed to explain the film to general audiences) heavily features Black Panther and Wakanda, which Alexander said could not have been done before the additional marketing for Black Panther that happened after the conventions provided additional context. Gael Cooper of CNET observed that the trailer was viewed nearly 500,000 times in its first 15 minutes after it was posted on YouTube, but questioned if the trailer broke the site after the view counter appeared to be stuck at 467,331. The trailer was viewed 230 million times in its first 24 hours, becoming the most viewed trailer in that time period, surpassing the record of It.\nIn January 2018, Marvel Comics published a two-issue prequel comic titled Avengers: Infinity War Prelude, which serves as a bridge between Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War. A commercial for Infinity War aired during Super Bowl LII, and generated the most social media buzz of all the films advertised according to comScore and United Talent Agency; it was viewed 17.6 million times across YouTube and Facebook. On February 27, Disney and Marvel announced the \"Marvel: The Universe Unites\" charity campaign leading to the release of merchandise for the film on March 3. The week-long event saw stars from the film create social media challenges to provide funds and raise awareness for charities that support children and families impacted by serious illness. Marvel planned to make a $250,000 donation to Starlight Children's Foundation if these posts collectively reached 1 million likes, while Disney planned to donate 10% of all Marvel's Disney Store sales in the United States and online on the weekend of March 3 to the Make-A-Wish Foundation, up to $50,000. Hasbro and Funko each donated $1 million worth of cash and products, to Give Kids the World Village and Starlight Children's Foundation, respectively.\nA second trailer was released on March 16, which earned over 1 million views on YouTube in less than three hours after it was released. Alyssa Rosenberg of The Washington Post was not overly enthused about another superhero film having \"special-effects-heavy villains, or the sight of yet another mysterious object hanging over the Manhattan skyline\", but felt the trailer made her realize \"that I'm actually looking forward to seeing [the characters of the MCU] get to know each other\". Spiegel agreed with Rosenberg about the potential for character interactions, but felt it was \"gimmicky\" to have so many \"crossover-style introductions or combinations of heroes in a movie like this\". The second trailer was viewed 179 million times in the first 24 hours, the third-most viewed trailer in that time period, behind the first trailer for the film and It, while also becoming the biggest release for a second trailer, surpassing Beauty and the Beast (2017) (128 million views). A week before the film's release, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai was lit up each night for the film, counting down to its release. Marvel also featured tie-in events across seven of their mobile games to promote the film. In early May, Marvel and Epic Games announced the \"Infinity Gauntlet Limited Time Mashup\" mode for Fortnite Battle Royale, where players could find the Infinity Gauntlet hidden on the game map and become Thanos with added abilities. The Russo brothers were fans of Fortnite and approached Donald Mustard, the worldwide creative director of Epic Games, about the potential for a crossover between the properties. On November 20, Little, Brown and Company published Marvel's Avengers: Infinity War: Thanos \u2013 Titan Consumed, written by Barry Lyga. Despite not existing within Marvel Studios' MCU canon, the novel explores the origins of Thanos before the events of the film. Lyga spoke with Marvel Studios to get an \"outline of who Thanos is and what he means to the movies\", and \"was given great latitude and a free hand [in some areas of the story], while in others I had to tip-toe very carefully through the MCU\".\nAll-in-all, the studio spent an estimated $150 million on prints and advertisements promoting the film. Additional marketing partners for the film included Coca-Cola, Quicken Loans and their Rocket Mortgage service, the Infiniti QX50 (which appears in the film), Ziploc, Go-Gurt, Yoplait, Synchrony Bank, American Airlines, and Stand Up to Cancer. The partners created television commercials \"inspired by or featuring the film's characters and themes\", interactive digital initiatives, and robust in-store presences at numerous retailers. Duracell, Unilever, Quaker Oats Company, Chevron, and Samsung ran promotions in smaller markets. Coca-Cola, Ziploc, Go-Gurt, and Yoplait created special packaging in support of the film, with Synchrony implementing a \"Save Like a Hero\" campaign, and Stand Up to Cancer and American Airlines launching a national campaign with a PSA starring Johansson and Hemsworth. In the United Kingdom, OnePlus released an Infinity War edition for one of their smartphones. Deadline Hollywood estimated the media value was $150 million, the largest for any Marvel film, with Coca-Cola contributing an estimated $40 million.\n\nRelease\nTheatrical\nAvengers: Infinity War held its world premiere at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on April 23, 2018, screening also at the adjacent El Capitan Theatre and Grauman's Chinese Theatre. It was released in most countries worldwide, including the United States, on April 27, with a few debuts beginning as early as April 25, and was shown in IMAX and 3D on select screens. In the United States, the film opened in 4,474 theaters, 408 of which were IMAX; this was the widest release for a Disney title ever and the second-widest ever after Despicable Me 3's (2017) 4,529 theaters. Three of AMC Theatres' locations screened the film for 24 hours straight, with 53 of their locations having showtimes at either 2 am or 3 am to accommodate demand. In India, the film had the biggest release ever for a Hollywood film, opening on nearly 2,000 screens in four languages. The film also screened in 515 4DX theaters in 59 countries. Avengers: Infinity War was originally scheduled to be released on May 4 in the United States. The Chinese release of the film, which opened on May 11, was originally scheduled to end on June 10, but was granted a \"rare\" extension of 30 days, to end on July 9. Avengers: Infinity War is part of Phase Three of the MCU.\nSelect footage from the film was screened in various cities during the film's press tour in early April, ahead of the Los Angeles premiere. The Russos said only a limited amount of the film would be shown at these screenings to reduce the chance of spoilers being leaked. Adam Chitwood of Collider commented that this was \"highly unusual as most Marvel movies are screened in their entirety for press about a month before they hit theaters\". Ahead of the United States release, AMC Theatres in New York City and Orlando, Florida aired an eleven-MCU film marathon beginning on April 25, ending in a screening of Infinity War. The El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles had a similar marathon for the film's release.\n\nHome media\nAvengers: Infinity War was released on digital download by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on July 31, 2018, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on August 14. The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, and a blooper reel. The digital release also features a roundtable discussion between MCU directors the Russos, Jon Favreau, Joss Whedon, James Gunn, Ryan Coogler, Peyton Reed, and Taika Waititi. In terms of home media sales, the physical versions of the film were collectively the top home media release of the week in which they were first released.\nDespite being shot with IMAX cameras and released in IMAX theaters in the 1.90:1 aspect ratio, the home media release did not present the film in that aspect ratio, instead including a cropped 2.39:1 aspect ratio that was used for non-IMAX screenings. Joe Russo said they \"spent a long time trying to\" have the IMAX version on the home media, but since the IMAX Corporation has \"agency over that format\", the situation was \"complicated\". He did not rule out the possibility that this version could be available at a later point. The IMAX Enhanced version of the film was made available on Disney+ beginning on November 12, 2021.\n\nReception\nBox office\nAvengers: Infinity War grossed $678.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $1.374 billion in other territories, for a worldwide total of $2.052 billion, becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film of all time, the highest-grossing film of 2018, the highest-grossing MCU film, and the highest-grossing superhero film.\nIts worldwide opening weekend of $640.5 million was the biggest of all time, beating The Fate of the Furious's (2017) $541.9 million. It was later beat by its sequel, Avengers: Endgame, which grossed $1.222 billion in its opening weekend.\nIt was the fastest film to make $1 billion at the worldwide box office, doing so in 11 days to eclipse Star Wars: The Force Awakens's (2015) record of 12 days. Also, in its second weekend, Infinity War passed $13.5 million from 4DX screens, which was the all-time record for the format. On June 12, 2018, Avengers: Infinity War passed the $2 billion mark at the worldwide box office, becoming the fourth film to cross that milestone after Avatar (2009), Titanic (1997), and The Force Awakens. Crossing the mark in 48 days, it was the second-fastest to that point, after Avatar's 47-day record and later the 11-day record of Avengers: Endgame. With $140 million worldwide from IMAX, the film is the third-largest worldwide in the format, behind Avatar and The Force Awakens, and the largest for a Marvel film. Deadline Hollywood calculated the film's net profit as $500 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it first on their list of 2018's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".\n\nPre-sale ticket records\nIn December 2017, a survey from Fandango indicated that Infinity War was the most anticipated film of 2018. Fandango later reported that Infinity War achieved the largest initial 24-hour ticket pre-sales for a superhero film, taking just 6 hours to surpass the previous 24-hour record set by Black Panther. Atom Tickets reported that Infinity War sold more tickets in its first pre-sales day than Black Panther sold in its first month. Within 72 hours, the film generated the largest pre-sales for any superhero film at AMC Theatres, with its advance ticket sales being 257.6% ahead of Black Panther's, 751.5% ahead of Captain America: Civil War, and 1,106.5% ahead of Avengers: Age of Ultron during the same time frame. Two weeks before its release, Fandango revealed that advance ticket sales for Infinity War were outpacing the last seven MCU films combined in the same timeframe, and had become the company's top April release. It was also on pace to become the top superhero film. A week before the film released, The Wall Street Journal said the film had sold more than $50 million worth of advance tickets, behind only The Force Awakens and Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017), with Fandango reporting that more than 2,500 showtimes had sold out. On Atom Tickets, Infinity War had the most pre-sale volume, selling 7% higher than The Last Jedi and 250% higher than Black Panther at the same point in their sales. Atom also reported that ticket sales for Infinity War were doubling daily the week of its release, the fastest rate of increase the service has seen for any MCU title.\n\nUnited States and Canada\nAvengers: Infinity War earned $106.7 million on its opening day in the United States and Canada (including $39 million from Thursday night previews), for an opening weekend total of $258.2 million. The Thursday night preview earning was the best for an MCU film (beating Avengers: Age of Ultron's $27.6 million) and the fourth-best of all time, behind The Force Awakens ($57 million), The Last Jedi ($45 million), and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2 (2011) ($43.5 million). Fandango reported that $14 million of the $39 million came from ticket pre-sales from the company. The opening day gross was the second-best ever, behind The Force Awakens's $119.1 million; its Saturday gross of $83 million was the best-ever Saturday gross, beating Jurassic World's (2015) $69.6 million; and its Sunday gross of $69.2 million was the best-ever, beating The Force Awakens's $60.5 million. The total weekend gross became the highest-grossing opening weekend, beating The Force Awakens's $248 million. IMAX contributed $22.5 million to the opening weekend gross, which was the best opening for a Marvel film in the format and the third-biggest opening, behind The Force Awakens ($30 million) and The Last Jedi ($24.7 million). AMC reported that the film had the highest Friday and Saturday box office gross for a single title in the company's history, while Fandango reported that approximately $84 million worth of tickets were sold through the service, approximately 30%, which was the largest share of the weekend box office for any film in the company's history. Avengers: Infinity War earned an additional $25 million the Monday after its opening weekend, which was the highest-grossing Monday in April, beating Furious 7 (2015) ($14 million), and the second-best Monday gross for an MCU film, after Black Panther ($40.1 million). The next day, it earned $23.5 million, which was the highest-grossing Tuesday for an MCU film, beating Black Panther ($20.8 million), and the highest-grossing Tuesday in May, beating The Avengers ($17.6 million). It also tied The Force Awakens for the fastest to reach $300 million at five days.\nThe film remained number one in its second weekend, earning $115.5 million, which was the second-best second weekend ever after The Force Awakens ($149.2 million). Infinity War also surpassed $400 million in the weekend, doing so in nine days, becoming the second fastest film to reach that mark, again after The Force Awakens's eight days. In its third weekend, Infinity War remained number one at the box office, and became the second-fastest film to surpass $500 million, doing so in 15 days (behind The Force Awakens's 10 days). The weekend also saw its total domestic IMAX gross become $48.1 million, which was the highest for any MCU film. The film's fourth weekend saw it come in second, behind Deadpool 2, and in its fifth it finished third behind Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018) and Deadpool 2. By May 23, Infinity War surpassed $600 million, becoming the second-fastest film to do so in 26 days, after The Force Awakens (12 days). It remained in the top ten through its ninth weekend. In the United States and Canada, it went on to become the fourth-highest-grossing film of all time, and the second-highest-grossing superhero film, behind Black Panther.\n\nOther territories\nOutside the United States and Canada, the film earned $382.7 million from 52 markets, opening number one in all, and became the number two opening internationally, behind The Fate of the Furious ($444.2 million). IMAX contributed $18.5 million, which was the best opening outside of the US, Canada, and China, surpassing The Force Awakens ($17.5 million). All-time opening weekend records were set in South Korea ($39.2 million), Mexico ($25.4 million), Brazil ($19.1 million), India (for a Western release, $18.6 million), the Philippines ($12.5 million), Thailand ($10 million), Indonesia ($9.6 million), Malaysia, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Central America, Peru, Chile, Ecuador, Venezuela, Bolivia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and West Africa, with many also setting opening day records. France had the biggest superhero opening in the market with $17.7 million, as did Denmark, Finland, Norway, Portugal, and Sweden. The United Kingdom earned $8.9 million, which was the biggest MCU opening day and third-highest opening day for a Disney film; it would go on to earn $41.4 million for the weekend, which was the third-highest of all time and the second-highest Disney opening. Argentina had the second-highest opening day of all time, while Germany had the best superhero film opening day of all time, ultimately earning $14.7 million, which was the best superhero opening ever. Many other European countries and the Middle East also broke superhero film records. Japan had the second-biggest opening for an MCU film with $9 million, and Australia had the second-highest opening weekend ever, with $23.2 million.\nAvengers: Infinity War remained number one in its 54 markets in its second weekend. The $4.9 million opening day in Russia was the biggest of all time. However, there was some controversy with the film's release in that country. Originally, the Russian government ordered it to be released on May 11, but after a scandal the government made concessions and agreed to let it premiere on May 3 with a condition that on May 9, during the Victory Day, only Russian films would be played in the cinema theatres. Infinity War was also the first film in Russia to sell more than 1 million tickets in a single day, and went on to gross $17.6 million in the market, a new opening weekend record. IMAX contributed $2.2 million in the market, which was also an opening weekend record. In its third weekend, the film remained number one in a majority of its markets. Infinity War opened in China to $200 million (RMB 1.266 billion), which was the second-highest opening weekend in local currency behind The Fate of the Furious ($184 million and RMB 1.352 million). IMAX contributed $20.5 million, which was the third-largest opening in China. Infinity War also broke China's pre-sale record of 400 million yuan ($63 million). In India, Infinity War became the first Hollywood film to earn over \u20b92 billion net ($29.7 million), and also became the highest-grossing MCU film in the United Kingdom. In its sixth weekend, the film became the highest-grossing MCU film in Japan with $33 million.\nThe film became the highest-grossing release ever in Brazil, Indonesia, the Philippines, Central America, Bolivia, Venezuela, Latin America as a region, Mexico, Chile, Ecuador, Peru, Malaysia, Singapore, India (for a Western release), Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand (for a Western release), and Mongolia, the second-highest in the Asia-Pacific region (for a Western release), Hong Kong, and South Korea (for a Western release), and the third-highest in China (for a Western release). It is also the highest-grossing superhero film in many European countries, including the United Kingdom. As of June 17, 2018, the film's top markets are China ($373.4 million), the United Kingdom ($95.7 million), and South Korea ($92.8 million). The film is the third-highest-grossing film of all time in territories outside the United States and Canada.\n\nCritical response\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 85%, with an average score of 7.6\/10, based on 492 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Avengers: Infinity War ably juggles a dizzying array of MCU heroes in the fight against their gravest threat yet, and the result is a thrilling, emotionally resonant blockbuster that (mostly) realizes its gargantuan ambitions.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 68 out of 100 based on 54 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\nTodd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter praised the writers' and directors' ability to balance the large cast of characters, saying they, \"under the supervision of Marvel Films maestro Kevin Feige, acknowledge the traffic jam of egos and play it for laughs\". Owen Gleiberman of Variety concurred, stating, \"Infinity War is a brashly entertaining jamboree, structured to show off each hero or heroine and give them just enough to do, and to update their mythologies without making it all feel like homework\". Rolling Stone's Peter Travers said the film is \"too much of a good thing\" and wrote, \"The Russo brothers have clearly never learned the concept that less is more. They've used the premise of an Avengers reunion to put on a fireworks explosion of action and laughs that won't quit\". Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times called it Marvel's \"biggest and most ambitious movie yet\", but concluded \"it's certainly not the best. However, there's plenty of action, humor and heart\u2014and some genuinely effective dramatic moments\". Roeper went on to praise the film's cast and Josh Brolin in particular, whom he called \"the film's most interesting performance\". Gleiberman called Brolin's motion capture performance \"supremely effective\" and said, \"Brolin infuses Thanos with his slit-eyed manipulative glower, so that the evil in this movie never feels less than personal\". McCarthy wrote, \"Brolin's calm, considered reading of the character bestows this conquering beast with an unexpectedly resonant emotional dimension, making him much more than a thick stick figure of a supervillain\". Gleiberman also praised the film's action sequences, saying \"Infinity War brims with tensely spectacular combat sequences, even if the question of who's going to win each one has that extravagantly arbitrary could-Mighty-Mouse-beat-up-Superman? quality\". McCarthy called the scale of the action \"astonishing\", and Travers wrote, \"Avengers: Infinity War leaves viewers up in the air, feeling exhilarated and cheated at the same time, aching for a closure that never comes\". Josh Spiegel, also of The Hollywood Reporter, said the film takes \"a cue from the ending of The Empire Strikes Back in its super-sized finale; this is the equivalent of Han Solo frozen in the carbonite, on steroids\".\nA. O. Scott of The New York Times criticized the film's reliance on other films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, saying, \"Considered on its own, as a single, nearly 2-hour-40-minute movie, Avengers: Infinity War makes very little sense\", but conceded that it \"was never meant to be viewed or judged in isolation\". Richard Brody of The New Yorker agreed, stating, \"The insubstantiality of the film isn't due to the infinite yet flimsy malleability of C.G.I. gimmickry but, instead, to the dispersion of its drama throughout the many cinematic installations set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe\". Stephanie Zacharek of Time said, \"[It] isn't really a beginning, but more of a middle or an end with a new piece of yarn attached. You need to have seen and internalized every one of the previous 18 Marvel Cinematic Universe movies to fully get it\". Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times called it a \"brisk, propulsive, occasionally rousing and borderline-gutsy continuation of a saga that finally and sensibly seems to be drawing to a close\", but called its ultimate bid for catharsis \"unsuccessful\" since the Marvel \"assembly line [is not stopped] from chugging ahead with its signature polished, mechanized efficiency\". Scott also criticized the action sequences, calling them \"tedious and predictable\" and \"surely the most expensive parts of the movie, but the money seems less like an imaginative tool than a substitute for genuine imagination\". Likewise, Zacharek said, \"There's no pacing in Avengers: Infinity War. It's all sensation and no pulse. Everything is big, all of the time\".\n\nAudience response\nAudiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, and those at PostTrak gave the film an 87% overall positive score and a 68% \"definite recommend\". American YouTube personality Tony \"Nem\" Mitchell watched the film 103 times in theaters, a world record. When Mitchell's streak was gaining media awareness around his 44th viewing, he noted that IMAX reached out to give him 50 free tickets to continue the streak, and the Russo brothers invited him to Endgame's premiere. Mitchell said this was the way he \"want[ed] to support Marvel and the Russo brothers\". Seventeen-year-old Kieran Harvey from Staffordshire also watched the film in theaters 100 times. Harvey stated that he \"didn't plan on seeing it this many times it just sort of happened\" adding that Infinity War \"just felt so different to anything I've ever seen before, and I just love it so much so have been going as much as I can!\"\nThe ending of the film sparked various Internet meme reactions, including one referencing Spider-Man saying he does not feel good as he disintegrates, which was applied to other things. The website, DidThanosKill.Me was created for fans to see if they would have been spared by Thanos or not. The ending also spawned the creation of the Reddit subreddit, \/r\/thanosdidnothingwrong. A user within the subreddit suggested that half of the approximately 20,000 subscribers at the time be banned from the subreddit, in order to mimic the events of the film. After the community agreed to the measure, the moderators approached Reddit's administrators to see if the mass ban would even be possible. Once the administrators agreed to the random ban of half the subscribers, it was set to occur on July 9, 2018. Notice of the impending ban made the subreddit's subscribers increase to over 700,000, including both of the Russos who subscribed. Ahead of the ban, Brolin posted a video saying \"Here we go, Reddit users,\" and ending it with a snap. Over 60,000 people watched a live Twitch stream of the ban occurring, which lasted several hours. The ban of over 300,000 accounts, which included Anthony Russo, was the largest in Reddit's history. Those banned then gathered in the new subreddit, \/r\/inthesoulstone. One Reddit user who participated described the ban as embodying \"the spirit of the Internet\" with people \"banding together, en masse, around something relatively meaningless but somehow decidedly awesome and hilarious\". Andrew Tigani of Screen Rant said this showed \"how impactful the film has already become to pop culture. It is also a testament to how valuable fan interaction can be via social media\".\n\nAccolades\nAt the 91st Academy Awards, Avengers: Infinity War received a nomination for Best Visual Effects. The film's other nominations include an Annie Award, a British Academy Film Award, and two Critics' Choice Awards, among others. In 2020, Infinity War was ranked seventh in an Empire magazine poll for the 100 greatest films of the 21st century.\n\nSequel\nAvengers: Endgame was released on April 26, 2019, with the Russos returning to direct, and Markus and McFeely once again writing the screenplay.\n\nSee also\n\"What If...

Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the direct sequel to Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and the 22nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the film features an ensemble cast which includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Paul Rudd, Brie Larson, Karen Gillan, Danai Gurira, Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau, Bradley Cooper, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Josh Brolin. In the film, the surviving members of the Avengers and their allies attempt to reverse Thanos's actions in Infinity War which erased half of all life in the universe.\nThe film was announced in October 2014 as Avengers: Infinity War \u2013 Part 2, but Marvel Studios later removed this title. The Russo brothers joined as directors in April 2015, with Markus and McFeely signing on to write the script a month later. It is a conclusion to the story of the MCU up to that point, ending the story arcs of several main characters. The film's plot revisits several moments from earlier films, bringing back actors and settings from throughout the franchise. Filming began in August 2017 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, shooting back-to-back with Infinity War, and ended in January 2018. Additional filming took place in the Metro and downtown Atlanta areas, New York State, Scotland, and England. The official title was announced in December 2018. With an estimated budget of $356\u2013400 million, the film is one of the most expensive films ever produced.\nAvengers: Endgame premiered at the Los Angeles Convention Center on April 22, 2019, and was released in the United States on April 26 as part of Phase Three of the MCU. The film received praise for its direction, acting, musical score, action scenes, visual effects, and emotional weight, with critics lauding its culmination of the 22-film story. It grossed $2.799 billion worldwide, surpassing Infinity War's entire theatrical run in eleven days and setting a number of box-office records; it was the highest-grossing film of all time from July 2019 to March 2021. The film was nominated for Best Visual Effects at the 92nd Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. Two further films, Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars, are scheduled for release in 2026 and 2027, respectively.\n\nPlot\nIn 2018, 23 days after Thanos erased half of all life in the universe, Carol Danvers rescues Tony Stark and Nebula from deep space. They reunite with the remaining Avengers\u2014Bruce Banner, Steve Rogers, Thor, Natasha Romanoff, and James Rhodes\u2014and Rocket on Earth. Locating Thanos on an uninhabited planet, they plan to use the Infinity Stones to reverse his actions but find that Thanos has destroyed them. Enraged, Thor decapitates Thanos.\nFive years later, Scott Lang escapes from the Quantum Realm. Reaching the Avengers Compound, he explains that he experienced only five hours while trapped. Theorizing that the Quantum Realm allows time travel, they ask a reluctant Stark to help them retrieve the Stones from the past to reverse Thanos's present actions. Stark, Rocket, and Banner, who has merged his intelligence with the Hulk's strength, build a time machine. Banner notes that altering the past does not affect the present; any changes create alternate realities. Banner and Rocket travel to Norway, where they visit the Asgardian refugee settlement of New Asgard and recruit an overweight, despondent Thor. In Tokyo, Romanoff recruits Clint Barton, who became a vigilante after the erasure of his family.\nBanner, Lang, Rogers, and Stark time-travel to New York City during Loki's attack in 2012. At the Sanctum Sanctorum, Banner convinces the Ancient One to give him the Time Stone after promising to return the Infinity Stones to their proper points in time. At Stark Tower, Rogers retrieves the Mind Stone from Hydra sleeper agents; Stark and Lang's attempt to steal the Space Stone fails, allowing 2012-Loki to escape with it. Rogers and Stark travel to Camp Lehigh in 1970, where Stark obtains an earlier version of the Space Stone and encounters his father, Howard. Rogers steals Pym Particles from Hank Pym to return to the present and sees his lost love, Peggy Carter.\nRocket and Thor travel to Asgard in 2013; Rocket extracts the Reality Stone from Jane Foster. Thor is encouraged by his mother, Frigga, and retrieves his old hammer, Mjolnir. Barton, Romanoff, Nebula, and Rhodes travel to 2014; Nebula and Rhodes go to Morag and steal the Power Stone before Peter Quill can, while Barton and Romanoff travel to Vormir. The Soul Stone's keeper, Red Skull, says that it can only be acquired by sacrificing a loved one. Romanoff sacrifices herself, allowing Barton to get the Stone. Rhodes and Nebula attempt to return to their own time, but Nebula is incapacitated when her cybernetic implants link with her past self; this allows 2014-Thanos to learn about his future self's success and the Avengers' attempt to undo it. 2014-Thanos sends 2014-Nebula forward in time to prepare for his arrival.\nReuniting in the present, the Avengers place the Stones into a gauntlet that Stark, Banner, and Rocket have built. Banner, who has the most resistance to their radiation, uses the gauntlet to undo Thanos's disintegrations. Meanwhile, 2014-Nebula (impersonating her future self) uses the time machine to transport 2014-Thanos and his warship to the present and destroys the Avengers Compound. Present-day Nebula convinces 2014-Gamora to betray Thanos, but is unable to convince 2014-Nebula and kills her. Thanos overpowers Stark, Thor and a Mjolnir-wielding Rogers; he summons his army to retrieve the Stones, intent on using them to destroy the universe and create a new one. A restored Stephen Strange arrives with other sorcerers, the restored Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy, the Ravagers, and the armies of Wakanda and Asgard to fight Thanos's army. Danvers also arrives and destroys Thanos's warship, but Thanos overpowers her and seizes the gauntlet. Stark steals the Stones and uses them to disintegrate Thanos and his army, sacrificing himself.\nAfter Stark's funeral, Thor appoints Valkyrie as the new king of New Asgard and joins the Guardians. Rogers returns the Stones and Mjolnir to their proper timelines and remains in the past to live with Carter. In the present, an elderly Rogers passes his shield to Sam Wilson.\n\nCast\nRobert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark \/ Iron Man:The benefactor of the Avengers who describes himself as a \"genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist\" with electromechanical suits of armor he made. According to directors Joe and Anthony Russo, Downey was the only actor to receive the entire screenplay for the film. Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely knew that Stark's death was inevitable as a \"[move] to selflessness\" and as an end to the \"chapter\" Stark began. They felt that his death was earned after granting him \"the perfect retirement life ... That's the life he's been striving for [...] They got married, they had a kid, it was great. It's a good death. It doesn't feel like a tragedy. It feels like a heroic, finished life.\" Joe Russo said that Stark \"always knew he was going to die because he could never reconcile that notion in himself of not protecting the universe,\" and was the most defiant of the Avengers: \"Stark is the most formidable of all of them [...] because of his heart.\" The Russos sought Downey's approval for Stark's arc, which they had developed since Captain America: Civil War (2016).\nChris Evans as Steve Rogers \/ Captain America:The leader of the Avengers, World War II veteran and former fugitive, he was enhanced to the peak of human physicality by an experimental serum and frozen in suspended animation before waking up in the modern world. Markus described Rogers as someone who is \"moving toward some sort of enlightened self-interest\". McFeely knew that Rogers \"was going to get his dance\" that he promised Peggy Carter in Captain America: The First Avenger (2011). He initially planned to complete Rogers's story arc by killing him off, given the character's long life for his occupation, before deciding to have Rogers abandon his shield. Patrick Gorman provided an on-set reference for an elderly Steve Rogers.\nMark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner \/ Hulk:An Avenger and genius scientist who, because of exposure to gamma radiation, transforms into a monster when enraged or agitated. Banner balances his two sides with gamma experimentation in this film, enabling him to combine his intelligence with the Hulk's strength and physical stature based on his \"Professor Hulk\" comic-book identity. Compared to other heroes who were demotivated by their loss to Thanos, Banner is the only character to remain hopeful; according to Anthony Russo, \"Banner is the sole character who is actually forging into a bright new future, trying to build something totally new and find something completely new [...] Banner is the one who is most heroic in a sense that he maintains his will to keep trying.\" This concludes a character arc that was established in Thor: Ragnarok (2017) and continued in Avengers: Infinity War.\nChris Hemsworth as Thor:An Avenger and the king of Asgard, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name. Thor now wields a mystical axe known as Stormbreaker after the destruction of his hammer, Mjolnir, in Thor: Ragnarok. In the film, Thor has become an overweight, drunken ruler of Asgard's refugees in T\u00f8nsberg, Norway.  Hemsworth said about this drastic character change, \"I just had an opinion. I wanted to do something different this time. Each film I've wanted to, in particular, the last couple, and they were on board,\" and added, \"We shot for many hours and days and discussed how far could we push (Thor) and what we could do different.\" According to Anthony Russo, \"Even though there's a lot of fun to be had in the movie with his physical condition, it's not a gag. It's a manifestation of where he is on a character level, and we think it's one of the most relatable aspects of him. I mean, it's a very common sort of response to depression and pain.\" Thor's story was Russo's favorite arc: \"Part of Chris' magic as a comedic actor is his dedication to the depth of the character on a very earnest level [...] It's so devious and subversive when comedy is coming from a place of complete commitment and emotional complexity.\" Hemsworth underwent around three hours of hair and makeup work for the transformation, which also required him to wear a large silicone prosthetic suit; he called himself \"Lebowski Thor\" on set. Thor was initially supposed to revert to his \"old chiseled self\" in the middle of Endgame, but Hemsworth wanted to retain Thor's new physique.\nScarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff \/ Black Widow:An Avenger and a highly trained spy and former agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Romanoff continues to command several teams from around the galaxy in the Avengers headquarters at the beginning of the film,  which Joe Russo said stemmed from her inability to move on from their failure to stop Thanos: \"[S]he's doing everything she can to try and hold the community together [...] She's the watcher on the wall still.\" On the decision for Romanoff to sacrifice herself for Barton to acquire the Soul Stone to bring everyone back, Joe Russo said that it was part of a larger theme of the desires to sacrifice or protect in Infinity War: \"When she gets to that [Soul Stone] scene, I think she understands that the only way to bring the community back is for her to sacrifice herself.\" McFeely said, \"Her journey, in our minds, had come to an end if she could get the Avengers back. She comes from such an abusive, terrible, mind-control background, so when she gets to Vormir and she has a chance to get the family back, that's a thing she would trade for.\" To prepare for the film, Johansson adopted an intense workout regimen which included plyometrics, Olympic weightlifting and gymnastics and a time-restricted diet. All were supervised by her longtime trainer, Eric Johnson, with whom she had worked since Iron Man 2 (2010) \u2013 the film which introduced her character.\nJeremy Renner as Clint Barton \/ Hawkeye:A master archer and a former Avenger and agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. who was recently under house arrest. McFeely described Barton's dark turn as \"a good example of people who had much stronger stories after the Snap.\" The film's cold open, with the disintegration of Barton's family, was initially supposed to be in Infinity War after Thanos snapped; it was moved to Endgame, however, with Markus saying that it was \"going to blunt the brutality of what [Thanos] did.\" Joe Russo called it \"a very tragic scene to open the movie with. It's one of the few scenes in the movie that actually makes me tear up when I watch it, because I think about my own family [...] And then you think about what would happen to you, as a father. You'd become very self-destructive.\"\nDon Cheadle as James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes \/ War Machine:An officer in the U.S. Air Force and an Avenger who operates the War Machine armor. Cheadle described Rhodes's newfound belonging as an Avenger as \"not so much straddling one foot in the military. He's much more on the side of The Avengers than he was prior.\" This is reflected on Rhodes's more instinctive and realistic worldview in the midst of encountering the fantastic; according to Cheadle, \"He's definitely got some 'what-the-eff-is-happening' [attitude,] more than maybe the rest of them do, given his background. But it's a trial by fire, and he's quickly adapted to what [the threat] is, rather than what he wishes it were.\"\nPaul Rudd as Scott Lang \/ Ant-Man:A former petty criminal and Avenger who acquired a suit that allows him to shrink or grow in size while also increasing in strength. Lang is portrayed by twins Bazlo and Loen LeClair as a baby, by Jackson A. Dunn at age 12, and by Lee Moore at age 93. This was Moore's final film before his death in August 2018. Markus explained that adding Lang helped with implementing time travel into the film, saying, \"we had access to him in the second movie, and the fact that he was bringing a whole subset of technology that did have something to do with a different concept of time was like a birthday present.\"\nBrie Larson as Carol Danvers \/ Captain Marvel:An ex-U.S. Air Force fighter pilot and Avenger whose DNA was altered during an accident, giving her superhuman strength, energy projection, and flight. Markus said that Danvers's powers are on a scale that has not previously existed in the MCU and compared her personality to Rogers's, \"which is sort of a person who's right and knows they're right and doesn't really want to hear it when you tell them they're wrong\". Danvers has little screen time in the film, which McFeely said was \"not the story we're trying to tell\u2014it's the original Avengers dealing with loss and coming to a conclusion, and she's the new, fresh blood.\" Larson filmed her scenes for Endgame before beginning work on her solo film, Captain Marvel (2019), which was released first. Captain Marvel directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck were present for the filming of her scenes in Endgame, and gave Danvers's characterization in the film their blessing.\nKaren Gillan as Nebula:An adopted daughter of Thanos and an Avenger who was raised with Gamora. After being an antagonist or an anti-hero in previous MCU films, Nebula undergoes a redemption arc and makes amends for her past actions (including an encounter with a past version of herself); according to Gillan, she is \"staring her former self in the face and it's really clear how far she's come from that angry, bitter and twisted person. She's starting to connect with other people and find some level of forgiveness.\" Gillan guessed that Nebula would play a prominent role in the film when she realized that Infinity War and Endgame would be adapted from The Infinity Gauntlet, which she had read when she was initially cast as Nebula in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014). Gillan shared several scenes, most of which were improvised, with Downey in the film's opening.\nDanai Gurira as Okoye: The general of the Dora Milaje, a group of elite women warriors.\nBenedict Wong as Wong: A Master of the Mystic Arts and a companion of Doctor Strange.\nJon Favreau as Happy Hogan: The former head of security at Stark Industries and Stark's friend and former driver.\nBradley Cooper as Rocket:A member of the Guardians and Avenger who is a genetically engineered, raccoon-based bounty hunter, mercenary, and master of weapons and battle tactics. Sean Gunn was again the stand-in for Rocket during filming, with his acting and expressions the character's motion reference. Rocket's appearance continues a story arc that was established by Guardians of the Galaxy writer-director and Endgame executive producer James Gunn in the first two Guardians of the Galaxy films, was continued in Infinity War and Endgame, and concluded in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023).\nGwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts:Stark's wife and the CEO of Stark Industries. Potts wears a weaponized powered exosuit of armor made for her by Stark, based on the Rescue armor. Paltrow said this would be her final major appearance in the MCU.\nJosh Brolin as Thanos:An intergalactic warlord from Titan who acquired all six Infinity Stones in Infinity War and triggered the Snap, killing half of all life in the universe. Joe Russo said that after Thanos was successful in Avengers: Infinity War, he was \"done\" and \"retired\". Markus and McFeely had difficulty in factoring the older, post-Infinity War Thanos into the film (because the character already had the Infinity Stones) until executive producer Trinh Tran suggested that they kill Thanos in the film's first act. Markus said that the character's early death improved his agenda. Thanos has less screen time in Endgame than in Infinity War, where he was considered the main character. According to McFeely, \"We had to give ourselves permission to backseat the villain a little bit. I don't think anyone in the first half of the movie is going, 'Oh I wish there was a villain'. You're rolling around in the loss and the time heist, and you think it's sort of Avengers against nature.\" The younger version of Thanos was nicknamed \"Warrior Thanos\" by the filmmakers. In addition to voicing the character, Brolin did the motion capture. Joe Russo was a stand-in for Thanos for some scenes with Nebula.\nSeveral actors from Infinity War reprise their roles in Endgame, including Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Stephen Strange, Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa \/ Black Panther, Tom Holland as Peter Parker \/ Spider-Man, Zoe Salda\u00f1a as Gamora, Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff, Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson \/ Falcon, Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes \/ Winter Soldier, Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Pom Klementieff as Mantis, Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer, Letitia Wright as Shuri, William Hurt as Thaddeus Ross, Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill, Winston Duke as M'Baku, Tom Vaughan-Lawlor as Ebony Maw, Jacob Batalon as Ned, Vin Diesel as Groot, Chris Pratt as Peter Quill \/ Star-Lord, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Ross Marquand as Red Skull \/ Stonekeeper, Michael James Shaw as Corvus Glaive, Terry Notary as Cull Obsidian, and Kerry Condon as the voice of Stark's suit AI F.R.I.D.A.Y. Monique Ganderton again provided motion capture for Proxima Midnight.\nAlso reprising their roles from previous MCU films were Evangeline Lilly as Hope van Dyne \/ Wasp, Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie, Rene Russo as Frigga, John Slattery as Howard Stark, Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One, Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter, Marisa Tomei as May Parker, Taika Waititi as Korg, Angela Bassett as Ramonda, Michael Douglas as Hank Pym, Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet van Dyne, Linda Cardellini as Laura Barton, Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez as Jasper Sitwell, Frank Grillo as Brock Rumlow, Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce, Callan Mulvey as Jack Rollins, and Ty Simpkins as Harley Keener. Sean Gunn reprised his role as Kraglin and was credited for the role, although he is not clearly visible in the film. Natalie Portman appears as Jane Foster in footage from a deleted Thor: The Dark World (2013) scene and a voiceover when Foster is talking in the distance. James D'Arcy reprised his role as Edwin Jarvis from the MCU television series Agent Carter, the first time a character introduced in an MCU television series appeared in an MCU film.\nHiroyuki Sanada played Akihiko, a Yakuza boss in Tokyo who opposes Barton. Lexi Rabe played Morgan Stark, Tony and Pepper's daughter. Katherine Langford was cast as an older Morgan, but her scene was cut from the final film. Emma Fuhrmann played an older Cassie Lang, Scott's daughter, after the character was played as a child by Abby Ryder Fortson in previous MCU films. Avengers co-creator Stan Lee had a posthumous cameo in the film, digitally de-aged as a car driver in 1970, in his final film appearance. Ken Jeong and Yvette Nicole Brown had cameo appearances as a storage facility guard and a S.H.I.E.L.D. employee, respectively. Co-director Joe Russo (credited as Gozie Agbo) had a cameo appearance as a grieving gay man, the first appearance of an openly homosexual character in an MCU film. Joe's daughters Ava and Lia Russo played Barton's daughter Lila and a fan of Hulk, respectively. Thanos creator Jim Starlin also appeared as a grieving man. The character Howard the Duck appeared in a non-speaking cameo.\n\nProduction\nIn October 2014, Marvel Studios announced a two-part sequel of Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) entitled Avengers: Infinity War. Part 1 was scheduled to be released on May 4, 2018, and Part 2 was scheduled for May 3, 2019. Marvel's plan was to film both parts of Infinity War back-to-back. Anthony and Joe Russo were hired to direct the films in April 2015. The next month, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely signed on to write screenplays for both parts of the film. Producer Kevin Feige said that the sequel was titled as two parts of a single film because of shared elements but they would be \"two distinct\" projects, not one story split across two films. The Russos decided to re-title the two films to remove any misconceptions in May 2016, and Marvel left the second film untitled that July. Feige and the Russo brothers indicated that the title was being withheld because it would give away plot details for this film and Infinity War.\nPrincipal photography began on August 10, 2017, under the working title Mary Lou 2 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, with Trent Opaloch the director of photography. The film and Infinity War were shot with ARRI Alexa IMAX 2D cameras, the first time a Hollywood feature film was shot entirely with IMAX digital cameras. Filming was done that month in the Gulch area of downtown Atlanta, near the Five Points MARTA station, and in Piedmont Park. Feige said that the films were originally scheduled to be filmed simultaneously but were ultimately shot back-to-back: \"It became too complicated to cross-board them like that, and we found ourselves\u2014again, something would always pay the price. We wanted to be able to focus and shoot one movie and then focus and shoot another movie.\" Anthony Russo originally felt that it made more sense to shoot the films simultaneously for financial and logistical reasons (including the large number of cast members), and had suggested that \"some days we'll be shooting the first movie and some days we'll be shooting the second movie. Just jumping back and forth.\" The 2013 Asgard scenes were shot at Durham Cathedral in Durham, England during production of Infinity War in early May 2017. Production wrapped on January 11, 2018, although additional filming took place in New York's Dutchess and Ulster counties in June 2018. Re-shoots began by September 7, 2018, and ended on October 12. More re-shoots were done in January 2019. Location shooting also took place in St Abbs, Scotland, which doubled for New Asgard in Norway. Evans and Hemsworth earned $15 million each for the film.\nThe film's official title, Avengers: Endgame, and final U.S. release date of April 26, 2019, were revealed with the film's first trailer in December 2018. Visual effects for the film were created by Industrial Light & Magic, Weta Digital, DNEG, Framestore, Cinesite, Digital Domain, Rise, Lola VFX, Cantina Creative, Capital T, Technicolor VFX, and Territory Studio. Like previous MCU films, Lola worked on the de-aging scenes; the film has 200 de-aging and aging shots. Downey, Evans, Ruffalo, Hemsworth, Johansson, and Renner were de-aged to their 2012 appearances for scenes recreated from The Avengers (2012). Michael Douglas, John Slattery, and Stan Lee were also de-aged for the 1970 New Jersey scene, and Douglas's appearance in The Streets of San Francisco was referenced. Lola aged Evans for the final scene, where he is an elderly man, with make-up and a stand-in. Jeffrey Ford and Matthew Schmidt were the film's editors.\n\nMusic\nAlan Silvestri, who composed the score for The Avengers, was announced in June 2016 to be returning to score Infinity War and Endgame. The Russos began working with Silvestri on the Endgame score in early November 2018, and it was completed in late March 2019. A soundtrack album with Silvestri's score was released digitally by Hollywood Records on April 26, 2019, with a physical release on May 24. A video for the track \"Portals\", composed for the climactic \"Avengers assemble\" scene in which reinforcements arrive for the Avengers, was released on June 13.\nSilvestri described the score as having the franchise's most versatile tone, ranging from \"thunderous percussion and powerful brass\" for the action scenes to minimalist, jazz-inspired music for Ant-Man and the Quantum Realm. He reprised his themes from the previous Avengers films and Captain America: The First Avenger, including material he wrote for Thanos and the Infinity Stones in Infinity War. Silvestri found writing the music to end Captain America's story poignant, since he had \"been on this journey with him since the beginning\". The film also used the Ant-Man (2015) theme by Christophe Beck, the Doctor Strange (2016) theme by Michael Giacchino, and the Captain Marvel theme by Pinar Toprak. The songs \"Come and Get Your Love\" by Redbone and \"It's Been a Long, Long Time\" by Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn were also used after previously being heard in Guardians of the Galaxy and Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), respectively.\n\nMarketing\nThe marketing campaign for Endgame cost over $200 million, the most for any Marvel Studios film. Promotional partners included Stand Up to Cancer, Mastercard, Ulta Beauty, the Audi e-tron GT concept car (which appears in the film), McDonald's, GEICO, Coca-Cola, Google, General Mills, Hertz, Ziploc, Oppo, and Synchrony Financial. A year before the film's release, Germain Lussier of io9 spoke on the approach Marvel might have to take in marketing the film, given the end of Infinity War where many established characters die. He questioned if those characters would appear on posters and in toy campaigns, and if the actors playing them would participate in press events leading up to the film's release. Lussier felt that Disney and Marvel could focus on the original Avengers team members (most of the living characters), but noted that it would be more beneficial to show the return of the dead characters; this would create a \"mystery and curiosity about how they come back\" and a \"whole new level of interest\" for the film \"while having all the stars front and center\". Feige said in June 2018 that the dead characters would not be featured in the film's marketing. He presented a behind-the-scenes video from the film at CineEurope, and said that its marketing campaign would begin at the end of 2018. In early December 2018, before the first trailer's release, Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter spoke about the \"fevered anticipation\" surrounding it and felt it \"remarkable\", mostly \"fan-created, without [the] noticeable direction from Marvel or the filmmakers involved\"; knowledge about the film, without promotion was, \"a kind of brand awareness\" that was unusual. McMillan urged Marvel not to release any trailers for the film, since \"the advanced level of enthusiasm [...] [was] likely to build\" before its release; a trailer would take away the \"Schr\u00f6dinger's cat-esque position\", as it was \"almost guaranteed\" to disappoint fans.\nThe first trailer for the film was released on December 7, 2018. Dustin Sandoval, vice president of digital marketing for Marvel Studios, said that the marketing team \"made the choice\" to omit the \"title or hashtag\" for the film in its trailer posts, allowing fans to see the trailer without spoiling it by watching \"at the end\". Richard Newby, also of The Hollywood Reporter, felt that although little new material was revealed in the trailer, it offered a \"somber glimpse of a universe made unrecognizable\" and let the viewer consider \"the ending of Avengers: Infinity War and our questions of loss\". Newby noted that the trailer highlighted the characters' \"humble beginnings\" with its visual language, and left viewers with \"just as many questions as we had before\". Austen Goslin of Polygon said that the title references a line by Doctor Strange to Tony Stark in Infinity War and a line by Stark in Age of Ultron. Goslin said, \"The scene surrounding this line in Age of Ultron is one of the most important ones in the movie. Things look dark, and the group of heroes face an enemy they don't think they can defeat.\" The Endgame trailer \"mirrors this perfectly\", and \"shows us that the Avengers' two most prominent characters are who they've always been: Iron Man, a pessimist who keeps fighting no matter how hopeless things look, and Captain America, an optimist who believes that nothing is hopeless when the world's heroes fight together.\" The trailer was viewed 289 million times in its first 24 hours and was the most-viewed trailer in that time period, surpassing the record of Avengers: Infinity War (230 million views). It set a record for Twitter conversation for a film trailer in the first 24 hours, generating 549,000 mentions. By January 3, 2019, BoxOffice's \"Trailer Impact\" metric service indicated that 77 to 78 percent of people surveyed who viewed the Endgame trailer in the past three weeks had expressed interest in seeing the film. In the three weeks it was measured by the service, the trailer was number one for all and had the top two percent of respondents express interest in seeing the film since the service's introduction in March 2018.\nThe second trailer for the film and its theatrical release poster were released on March 14, 2019. All 13 actors on the poster received top billing except for Danai Gurira, whose name appeared in the poster's bottom billing block with Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau, and Gwyneth Paltrow (none of whom appeared on the poster). Despite this, her exclusion from the top billing prompted criticism from some fans. Petrana Radulovic of Polygon said that how an actor is credited on a poster \"is a complex process\" based on \"dealing with agents, fees, and movie star demands.\" Marvel Studios released an updated poster later that day, with Gurira in the top billing. The second trailer was viewed 268 million times in the first 24 hours, becoming the second-most-viewed trailer in that time period (behind the first trailer).\n\nRelease\nTheatrical\nAvengers: Endgame had its world premiere at the Los Angeles Convention Center on April 22, 2019. Disney converted the convention center's Hall K for the film's premiere, working with Dolby and QSC Audio to install a 70-foot (21-metre) screen, Dolby Vision projectors, and a Dolby Atmos sound system. The convention center also held the red carpet arrival and after-party for the premiere. The film was released in Australia, China, and other parts of Asia and Europe on April 24, in the United Kingdom on April 25, in the United States and India on April 26, and in Russia on April 29 in IMAX and 3D. It was originally scheduled to be released in the United States on May 3. Radio Liberty alleged that the Russian government postponed the film's release in that country to promote Russian-produced films. Avengers: Endgame is part of Phase Three of the MCU.\nFollowing the release of the second trailer for Marvel Studios' Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019) on May 6, Marvel began showing it at the end of Endgame screenings with a message before the film from Far From Home star Tom Holland telling the audience to stay until the end of the credits to see the trailer. In June, Feige announced that Avengers: Endgame would be re-released in theaters with seven minutes of new post-credits footage which included a Stan Lee tribute, an unfinished deleted scene, and the opening scene of Far From Home. A limited-edition poster would be given out at select theaters. The re-release began on June 28 in 1,040 theaters in the United States.\n\nHome media\nThe film was released for digital download by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on July 30, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on August 13. Streaming became exclusive to Disney+ on November 12, 2021. The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, and a blooper reel. Despite being filmed with IMAX cameras and released in IMAX theaters in the 1.90:1 aspect ratio, the home-media release has the cropped 2.39:1 aspect-ratio version used for non-IMAX screenings. The IMAX Enhanced version of the film was made available on Disney+ on November 12, 2021, and it earned $107.8 million from DVD and Blu-ray sales in the US.\n\nReception\nBox office\nAvengers: Endgame grossed $858.4 million in the United States and Canada and $1.941 billion in other territories for a worldwide total of $2.799 billion. It was the highest-grossing film of all time until it was surpassed by Avatar (2009) due to the 2021 re-release in China, and was the second-highest-grossing film of all time in the United States and Canada. Gone with the Wind (1939) remains the highest-grossing film (adjusted for inflation), and Avengers: Endgame is the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time worldwide.\nThe film had a worldwide opening of $1.2 billion, the biggest of all time, and nearly double Infinity War's previous record of $640 million. It is the fastest film to reach the $1 billion and $1.5 billion marks, doing so in five and eight days respectively. Deadline Hollywood estimated that the film would break even five days after release, \"unheard of for a major studio tentpole during its opening weekend\". The website calculated Avengers: Endgame's final net profit as $890 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participation, and other costs; box-office grosses and home-media revenue placed it first on its list of 2019's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".\nOn May 4, the film's earnings at the global box office surpassed the theatrical run of Infinity War. It was the fastest film to gross $2 billion worldwide, reaching that threshold in 11 days; Avatar did so in 47 days. Avengers: Endgame was the fifth film to surpass this threshold (after Avatar, Titanic (1997), Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015), and Infinity War), and reached the $2.5 billion mark in 20 days; Avatar did so in 72.\n\nPre-sale records\nEndgame was one of 2019's most anticipated films of 2019 in late December 2018, ranked second by IMDb and first by Fandango and Atom Tickets. Due to high demand when pre-sale tickets became available in the U.S. on April 2, 2019, customers on Atom Tickets and Fandango experienced long wait times and system delays; AMC Theatres' website and app crashed for several hours. Fandango announced that day that the film was its top-selling pre-sale title for the first 24 hours, breaking Star Wars: The Force Awakens's record in six hours. Atom said that the film was the website's bestselling first-day film (outselling Aquaman (2018) by four times), and Regal Cinemas reported that Endgame had sold more tickets in its first eight hours than Infinity War did in its first week. The film grossed $120\u2013140 million in pre-sales. Fandango announced the day before release that Endgame was its biggest pre-selling title of all time, surpassing The Force Awakens with over 8,000 sold-out showtimes across the US.\nIn India, the film sold one million tickets in one day for its English, Hindi, Tamil, and Telugu-language screenings; 18 tickets were sold every second. In China, pre-sale tickets became available on April 12; a record one million were sold in six hours, surpassing Infinity War's first-24-hours total in the first hour and earning $114.5 million (RMB 770 million) in pre-sales.\n\nUnited States and Canada\nOn April 4, industry tracking projected that the film would gross $200\u2013250 million domestically during its opening weekend; some insiders saw those figures as conservative, and expected a $260\u2013300 million debut. By the week of its release, domestic estimates had risen to $260\u2013270 million and some insiders suggested that a $300 million debut was possible. The film played in 4,662 theaters, 410 of which were in IMAX; it was the widest release ever, surpassing the record of Despicable Me 3's (2017) 4,529 theaters. Avengers: Endgame earned $357.1 million in its opening weekend, breaking Infinity War's record by nearly $100 million. It set records for Friday ($157.5 million, including $60 million from Thursday night previews), Saturday ($109.3 million), and Sunday ($90.4 million) totals, and had a higher total weekend gross than the previous box-office high of all films combined ($314 million). The film earned an average of $76,601 per theatre, breaking records for highest per-theatre average for a nationwide release ($59,982 for The Force Awakens) and the inflation-adjusted record held by Return of the Jedi (approximately $66,400, set in 1983). It earned $36.9 million the following Monday and $33.1 million on Tuesday, both the third-highest of all time. In its second weekend, the film made $147.4 million (the second-best second weekend ever) for a 10-day total of $621.3 million. It was the fastest film to pass the $600 million mark, ahead of The Force Awakens's 12 days and less than half the 26 days it took Infinity War. The film grossed $64.8 million the following week, the fourth-best third weekend ever. It passed the $700 million mark, tying The Force Awakens's record of 16 days. Endgame was finally dethroned in its fourth weekend by newcomer John Wick: Chapter 3 \u2013 Parabellum (2019). It earned $17.2 million the following weekend (a total of $22.3 million over the four-day Memorial Day weekend), crossing the $800 million threshold domestically. The film was added to 1,040 theaters during its tenth-weekend re-release and earned $6.1 million, an increase of 207 percent from the previous weekend. It earned $1.2 million in its thirteenth weekend, breaking Avatar's all-time record.\n\nOther territories\nEndgame was projected to gross around $680 million internationally over its first five days, for a global debut of $850\u2013950 million. The film was initially projected to gross $250\u2013280 million in China in its opening weekend but earned a record $107.5 million (RMB 719 million) in the country on its first day; this included $28.2 million (RMB 189 million) from midnight, 3 am and 6 am screenings, eclipsing The Fate of the Furious's (2017) record of $9.1 million. Due to the record-breaking first day and word of mouth (with a 9.1 on local review aggregator Douban and a 9.3 on ticket website Maoyan), debut projections were increased to over $300 million. The film made $169 million on its first day, the highest total of all time. Its largest markets after China were India ($9 million), South Korea ($8.4 million, the largest non-holiday single-day gross ever), Australia ($7.1 million), France ($6 million), and Italy ($5.8 million). The film over-performed, opening with $866 million overseas. Its largest markets, setting records for the best-ever opening in each country, were China ($330.5 million, RMB 2.22 billion), the United Kingdom ($53.8 million), South Korea ($47.4 million), Mexico ($33.1 million), Australia ($30.8 million), Brazil ($26 million), Spain ($13.3 million), Japan ($13 million), and Vietnam ($10 million). The film earned $21.6 million over its first four days in Russia after a government-caused delay of its premiere.\nIn its first week, the film's top five largest international markets were China ($459.4 million), the United Kingdom ($68.2 million), South Korea ($60.3 million), Mexico ($48.6 million), and India ($40.9 million). A week after its release, it became the highest-grossing foreign film of all time in China and India. The film's running total passed $1.569 billion from international markets in its second weekend, passing Titanic as the second-highest film overseas of all time. By January 2021, its top international markets were China ($632 million), the United Kingdom ($115 million), South Korea ($105 million), Brazil ($86 million), and Mexico ($78 million).\n\nCritical response\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 94%, with an average score of 8.2\/10 based on 557 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Exciting, entertaining, and emotionally impactful, Avengers: Endgame does whatever it takes to deliver a satisfying finale to Marvel's epic Infinity Saga.\" Metacritic (which uses a weighted average) gave the film a score of 78 out of 100 based on 57 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an A+ grade on an A+-to-F scale, the third Marvel film to receive the grade after The Avengers and Black Panther (2018). PostTrak audiences gave the film five stars out of five and an 85-percent \"definite recommend\".\nWriting for NPR, Glen Weldon gave the film a positive review and found it a worthy sequel to its predecessor: \"The Russos' decision to stick close to the experiences of the remaining Avengers proves a rewarding one, as they've expressly constructed the film as an extended victory lap for the Marvel Cinematic Universe writ large. Got a favorite character from any Marvel movie over the past decade, no matter how obscure? Prepare to get serviced, fan.\" In his Rolling Stone review, Peter Travers gave the film four stars out of five: \"You don't have to make jokes about the clich\u00e9d time travel plot \u2013 the film is ready, willing and able to make its own, with Back to the Future coming in for a serious ribbing.\"\nPeter Debruge of Variety wrote, \"After the must-see showdown that was Infinity War, the Russo brothers deliver a more fan-facing three-hour follow-up, rewarding loyalty to Marvel Cinematic Universe.\" J. R. Kinnard of PopMatters wrote, \"Big budget action filmmaking doesn't get much better than this.\" Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter said, \"[W]hat comes across most strongly here, oddly enough for an effects-driven comic-book-derived film, is the character acting, especially from Downey, Ruffalo, Evans, Hemsworth, Brolin, and Paul Rudd\". Richard Roeper, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, gave the film four stars and praised its \"emotional punch\" and the \"funny, well-paced, smart, expertly rendered screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, crisp direction from Anthony Russo and Joe Russo, [...] and the universally stellar performances\".\nThe New York Times reviewer A. O. Scott gave the film a positive-but-guarded review: \"Endgame is a monument to adequacy, a fitting capstone to an enterprise that figured out how to be good enough for enough people enough of the time. Not that it's really over, of course: Disney and Marvel are still working out new wrinkles in the time-money continuum. But the Russos do provide the sense of an ending, a chance to appreciate what has been done before the timelines reset and we all get back to work.\" Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times wrote that \"Avengers: Endgame achieves and earns its climactic surge of feeling, even as it falls just short of real catharsis\". Some called the film a notable improvement over its predecessor, Avengers: Infinity War, including Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com: Endgame is \"a more patient, focused film [than Infinity War], even as its plot draws in elements of a dozen other movies.\" Matt Zoller Seitz (also of RogerEbert.com) compared the film positively to Infinity War, which he considered \"too crowded, too rushed and yet too long\". Seitz called Endgame \"a heartfelt and satisfying experience\" and a \"surprisingly relaxed, character-driven, self-aware yet sincere comedy [for] two-thirds of [the film]. Much of the script suggests a laid-back Richard Linklater movie with superheroes\". Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal cited Avengers: Endgame as the conclusion of the Infinity Saga, calling the final battle \"inevitably unwieldy [...] but thrilling all the same, and followed by a delicate coda. So many stories. So many adventures. So much to sort out before the next cycle starts.\"\nRichard Brody was more critical of the film in The New Yorker, saying that its good acting was not matched by comparable skill from its directors: \"The Russos have peculiarly little sense of visual pleasure, little sense of beauty, little sense of metaphor, little aptitude for texture or composition; their spectacular conceit is purely one of scale, which is why their finest moments are quiet and dramatic ones\". Anthony Lane of The New Yorker gave the film a negative review, finding it overdeveloped and overwrought: \"The one thing you do need to know about Avengers: Endgame is that it runs for a little over three hours, and that you can easily duck out during the middle hour, do some shopping, and slip back into your seat for the climax. You won't have missed a thing.\"\n\nAccolades\nAt the 92nd Academy Awards, Avengers: Endgame received a nomination for Best Visual Effects. The film's other nominations include an Annie Award (which it won), a British Academy Film Award, and three Critics' Choice Movie Awards (winning two). Its Wikipedia page was the most-viewed article of 2019, with 44.2 million views. Endgame ranked 41st in a March 2020 Empire magazine poll of the 100 greatest films of the 21st century. The Avengers' assembling moment was one of five finalists for an Oscars Cheer Moment in the \"Oscars Fan Favorite\" contest for the 94th Academy Awards in February 2022, despite the film's ineligibility for other Academy Awards that year.\n\nFuture\nIn May 2018, the Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger said about Marvel's plans beyond Endgame: \"I'm guessing we will try our hand at what I'll call a new franchise beyond Avengers, but that doesn't necessarily mean you won't see more Avengers down the road. We just haven't made any announcements about that.\" Iger added that audiences should not assume that there would not be another Avengers film, due to the popularity of the characters and the franchise. Shortly after the film's premiere, the Russo brothers said that they were not opposed to returning to the MCU in the future due to their positive relationship with Marvel Studios, but did not plan to do so at that time. In January 2021, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige said that another Avengers film would be produced \"at some point\".\nAt the 2022 San Diego Comic-Con, Feige announced Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and Avengers: Secret Wars, scheduled to be released on May 2, 2025, and November 7, 2025, respectively. The films would conclude Phase Six of the MCU. Feige later said that the Russo brothers would not return to direct the films. Destin Daniel Cretton, who directed Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021), was confirmed as director of The Kang Dynasty shortly afterwards. In September, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023) writer Jeff Loveness was announced as writing the screenplay. The next month, Loki season one (2021) head writer and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022) writer Michael Waldron was hired to write the screenplay for Avengers: Secret Wars. Shortly afterwards, Secret Wars's release date was pushed back to May 1, 2026. In June 2023, Disney delayed The Kang Dynasty to May 1, 2026, and Secret Wars to May 7, 2027. Cretton had stepped down as director of The Kang Dynasty by November 2023, when Waldron was hired to replace Loveness as the writer for The Kang Dynasty. Jonathan Majors, who portrayed Kang the Conqueror and was expected to appear in both films, was fired by Disney and Marvel Studios in December 2023 after he was convicted of assault. By then, Marvel was referring to The Kang Dynasty internally as Avengers 5.\nAt the 2024 San Diego Comic-Con, the Russo brothers were announced to be directing the next two Avengers films. They revealed that Avengers 5 was now titled Avengers: Doomsday and would feature Doctor Doom as the main antagonist rather than Kang. Downey was revealed to have been cast as Doom for both films, and McFeely had taken over as writer for the films from Waldron.\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website \nAvengers: Endgame at IMDb \nAvengers: Endgame at AllMovie \nAvengers: Endgame at Disney A to Z \nScript Archived December 7, 2019, at the Wayback Machine. Additional archives: April 20, 2020.","30":"Avengers is a compilation album by the American punk group Avengers. It was released on vinyl in 1983 by CD Presents. It is the closest thing to a studio album the band has, although it was compiled by drummer Danny Furious from various recordings the band did in their three years of existence.\nThe album includes some songs previously released, including all of the songs from the We Are the One EP, two songs from the Avengers EP (as well as other songs recorded during the EP's sessions) and both songs from the \"Paint it Black\" single.\n\nRe-releases\nThe album has been re-released multiple times over the years. The first re-release came when the album was first released on cassette by CD Presents with two more tracks; the 1989 release on CD included the same bonus tracks. In 2000, Lady Butcher released the album on CD with 10 bonus tracks that were recorded live at the Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles, California, in August 1978. Sometime by 2003, singer Penelope Houston was selling CD-R copies of the album on her website. In 2010, CD Presents re-released the album through online music stores such as iTunes Store and Amazon MP3 and on CD only through Amazon.com featuring four alternate takes although this release appears to have been pulled due to a rights issues from Penelope Houston.  In 2012 Water Music Records re-released the compilation as a 2-CD set, with the first CD containing the 14 tracks of the original vinyl release, and the second CD containing additional demo and live recordings of the era.\n\nTrack listing\nVinyl (1983)\nSide One\n\"We Are the One\"\n\"Car Crash\"\n\"I Believe in Me\"\n\"Open Your Eyes\"\n\"No Martyr\"\n\"Desperation\"\n\"Thin White Line\"\n\nSide Two\n\"Paint it Black\" (Mick Jagger, Keith Richards)\n\"The Amerikan in Me\"\n\"White Nigger\"\n\"Uh Oh\"\n\"Second to None\"\n\"Corpus Christie\"\n\"Fuck You\" (live)\n\nCD (1989)\n\"We Are the One\"\n\"Car Crash\"\n\"I Believe in Me\"\n\"Open Your Eyes\"\n\"No Martyr\"\n\"Desperation\"\n\"Thin White Line\"\n\"Money, Money\"\n\"Paint it Black\"\n\"The Amerikan in Me\"\n\"White Nigger\"\n\"Uh Oh\"\n\"Second to None\"\n\"Cheap Tragedies\"\n\"Corpus Christie\"\n\"Fuck You\" (live)\n\nCD (2000)\n\"We Are the One\" \u2013 2:40\n\"Car Crash\" \u2013 4:20\n\"I Believe in Me\" \u2013 2:54\n\"Open Your Eyes\" \u2013 2:40\n\"No Martyr\" \u2013 3:04\n\"Desperation\" \u2013 2:33\n\"Thin White Line\" \u2013 3:12\n\"Money Money\" \u2013 2:25\n\"Paint It Black\" \u2013 3:17\n\"The American in Me\" \u2013 2:09\n\"White Nigger\" \u2013 3:37\n\"Uh-Oh\" \u2013 3:07\n\"Second to None\" \u2013 2:29\n\"Cheap Tragedies\" \u2013 3:05\n\"Corpus Christi\" \u2013 3:27\n\"Fuck You (live)\" \u2013 2:37\n\"The American in Me (live)\" \u2013 1:51\n\"White Nigger (live)\" \u2013 2:55\n\"Don't You (live)\" \u2013 2:58\n\"Open Your Eyes (live)\" \u2013 2:25\n\"C'Mon Everybody (live)\" \u2013 1:45\n\"Kingdom (live)\" \u2013 3:30\n\"We are the One (live)\" \u2013 2:19\n\"Thin White Line (live)\" \u2013 2:41\n\"No Martyr (live)\" \u2013 2:44\n\"I Believe in Me (live)\" \u2013 3:12\n\nCD\/digital (2010)\n\"We Are the One\" \u2013 2:40\n\"Car Crash\" \u2013 4:20\n\"I Believe in Me\" \u2013 2:53\n\"Open Your Eyes\" \u2013 2:40\n\"No Martyr\" \u2013 3:01\n\"Desperation\" \u2013 2:29\n\"Thin White Line\" \u2013 3:14\n\"Paint it Black\" \u2013 3:15\n\"The Amerikan in Me\" \u2013 2:05\n\"White Nigger\" \u2013 3:34\n\"Uh Oh\" \u2013 3:04\n\"Second to None\" \u2013 2:27\n\"Corpus Christi\" \u2013 3:31\n\"Fuck You\" (live) \u2013 2:42\n\"Cheap Tragedies\" \u2013 3:04\n\"No Martyr\" (alternate take) \u2013 3:01\n\"Thin White Line\" (alternate take) \u2013 2:53\n\"Desperation\" (alternate take) \u2013 2:11\n\"Corpus Christi\" (alternate take) \u2013 3:21\n\n2CD\/digital (2012)\nDISC 1\n\"We Are the One\" \u2013 2:40\n\"Car Crash\" \u2013 4:20\n\"I Believe in Me\" \u2013 2:53\n\"Open Your Eyes\" \u2013 2:40\n\"No Martyr\" \u2013 3:01\n\"Desperation\" \u2013 2:29\n\"Thin White Line\" \u2013 3:14\n\"Paint it Black\" \u2013 3:15\n\"The Amerikan in Me\" \u2013 2:05\n\"White Nigger\" \u2013 3:34\n\"Uh Oh\" \u2013 3:04\n\"Second to None\" \u2013 2:27\n\"Corpus Christi\" \u2013 3:31\n\"Fuck You\" (live) \u2013 2:42\n\nDISC 2\n\"Teenage Rebel\" (1977 Iguana rehearsal studio recording) \u2013 1:55\n\"Friends of Mine\" (1977 Iguana rehearsal studio recording) \u2013 2:14\n\"White Nigger\" (early version demoed at Wally Heider Studios in 1978) \u2013 3:26\n\"Cheap Tragedies\" (recorded on May 13, 1979, at Peter Miller Studios) \u2013 3:04\n\"The Good, the Bad, and the Kowalskis\" (1977 Iguana rehearsal studio recording) \u2013 5:04\n\"Crazy Homicide\" (Live January 14, 1978, at the Winterland Ballroom) \u2013 2:05\n\"Summer of Hate\" (Live January 14, 1978, at the Winterland Ballroom) \u2013 2:24\n\"I Believe in Me\" (Live January 14, 1978, at the Winterland Ballroom) \u2013 3:17\n\"Your Parents Sins\" (Live January 20, 1978, at the Mabuhay Gardens for the Miner's Benefit) \u2013 3:04\n\"Something's Wrong\" (Live August 12, 1978, at the Steamship in Santa Cruz) \u2013 2:42\n\"Money Money\" (1977 Iguana rehearsal studio recording) \u2013 2:22\n\"Misery\" (Live June 13, 1979, at the Old Waldorf) \u2013 2:58\n\"Time To Die\" (Live June 13, 1979, at the Old Waldorf) \u2013 5:12\n\"Release Me\" (Live June 13, 1979, at the Old Waldorf) \u2013 4:24\n\"Zero Hour\" (Live June 13, 1979, at the Old Waldorf) \u2013 3:38\n\"The American in Me\" (recorded on October 12, 1978, at Different Fur, and originally released in 1979 on White Noise) \u2013 2:15\n\"Uh-Oh\" (recorded on October 12, 1978, at Different Fur, and originally released in 1979 on White Noise) \u2013 3:07\n\nPersonnel\nPenelope Houston \u2013 vocals\nGreg Ingraham \u2013 guitar\nBrad Kunt \u2013 guitar on \"Corpus Christi\"\nDanny Furious \u2013 drums\nJimmy Wilsey \u2013 bass\n\n\n== References ==","31":"The Avengers are an American punk rock band formed in 1977 in San Francisco, California, United States. The band recorded an EP, We Are the One (1977), and after opening for the Sex Pistols worked with Steve Jones, but had not released an album before breaking up in 1979. After the breakup an EP with the Steve Jones-produced songs was released (The Avengers), and later an album, Avengers, in 1983. Their lead singer, Penelope Houston, is also a folk singer who has a solo career. Since 1999 a number of other albums were released with studio and live tracks, and the band has come together for various occasions.\n\nHistory\nEarly history\nDrummer Danny Furious (Danny O'Brien) and guitarist Greg Ingraham decided to start a band, and Furious approached Penelope Houston to be their singer, who agreed. They finished their lineup with Jonathon Postal on bass, although he was replaced shortly after by Jimmy Wilsey. Their first release (and only release while the band was originally together) was We Are the One, a three-song EP which was released on Dangerhouse Records in 1977.\nThe Avengers opened for the Sex Pistols in San Francisco at their final show at Winterland, which led to Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones producing a recording session for the band. In January 1979, Ingraham left the band and was replaced by Brad Kent, although the band only lasted a few more months until June 1979. An EP, titled Avengers, was released on White Noise Records a few months after the band broke up, which included songs from the Steve Jones produced session. Houston went on to record as a solo artist.\nAn album called Avengers (sometimes referred to as the Pink Album, including by Houston herself) was released in 1983. It featured tracks recorded through the band's whole time together, and was compiled by drummer Danny Furious. The album was out-of-print for a long time due to being in \"legal limbo\", during which time Houston sold the album in CD-R format directly through her website. The album was re-released in 2010.\n\nNew releases and re-formation\nIn 1999, a compilation album called Died for Your Sins was issued by Lookout! Records. In addition to original unreleased studio recordings and live tracks, three tracks were newly recorded in 1999 by the scAvengers, featuring original members Houston and Ingraham with new members bassist Joel Reader (The Mr. T Experience, The Plus Ones) and drummer Danny Panic (Screeching Weasel). To support the album, the scAvengers did a few shows. In 2003, a live album titled Zero Hour was released in Italy. The next year, The American in Me was released, featuring all of the tracks from Zero Hour plus four other unreleased studio recordings. Houston and Ingraham again joined with Reader and new drummer Luis Illades to perform some record release shows, and this lineup has performed sporadic live shows since.\nOn July 16, 2006, Houston and Ingraham joined Pearl Jam to perform \"American in Me\" at the Bill Graham Civic Center. By January 2017, they were recording in Berkeley with Robert Shimp.\n\nReception\n\" The Avengers were one of the best punk bands.

Founded by S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury, the team is a United States-based organization composed primarily of superpowered and gifted individuals, described as \"Earth's Mightiest Heroes\", who are committed to the world's protection from a variety of threats. The Avengers are depicted as operating in the state of New York: originally from the Avengers Tower in Midtown Manhattan and subsequently in the Avengers Compound in Upstate New York. Arranged as an ensemble of core MCU characters originally consisting of Tony Stark \/ Iron Man, Steve Rogers \/ Captain America, Thor, Bruce Banner \/ Hulk, Natasha Romanoff \/ Black Widow, and Clint Barton \/ Hawkeye, it later expands to include 16 total members. Regarded as an important part of the franchise, they are central to the MCU's first 23 films, collectively known as the Infinity Saga. The Avengers from alternate universes were depicted in subsequent MCU properties across the Multiverse Saga, including appearances in the Disney+ animated series What If...? (2021\u2013present) and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022). The Avengers are set to return in Avengers: Doomsday (2026) and Avengers: Secret Wars (2027). Both films will be part of the MCU's Phase Six, concluding the Multiverse Saga.\nFollowing the formation Marvel Studios as an independent film studio by Avi Arad, the head of Marvel's film division, producer Kevin Feige envisioned creating a shared cinematic universe to introduce the Avengers, similar to Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's comic books in the 1960s. Once Feige became studio chief in 2007 and formed his creative team, his strategy involved creating individual films for each major character in Phase One, beginning with Iron Man (2008) and concluding with The Avengers (2012). Casting for the original six members occurred from 2006 to 2010, beginning with Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man and concluding with Mark Ruffalo replacing Edward Norton as the Hulk by 2010. Successive MCU installments introduced new members, with actors from other MCU films reprising their roles. Following the financial and critical success of The Avengers, a sequel, Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), was subsequently developed, with Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen joining as Pietro and Wanda Maximoff, respectively. Then, Captain America: Civil War (2016) was gradually reworked into a film influenced by the \"Civil War\" comic storyline, depicting the Avengers's division and introducing Tom Holland as Peter Parker \/ Spider-Man. Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019) concluded the Infinity Saga and depicted their disbandment.\nThe four Avengers films are currently the third highest-grossing superhero franchise and the sixth highest-grossing film franchise of all time, grossing more than US$7.7 billion. The Avengers have received praise as a group from critics including their dynamic together, with Endgame received praise from critics as a conclusion for that iteration of the team. Due to their successful introduction, other film studios decided to create own shared superhero universes, notably DC Entertainment and Warner Bros. Pictures announcing plans to release a Justice League film. Avengers Campus, a series of attractions at various Disney Parks, opened in June 2021 at Disney California Adventure, while an immersive family dining experience called \"Avengers: Quantum Encounter\" debuted at the Worlds of Marvel restaurant in the Disney Wish cruise ship in July 2022.\n\nFictional team biography\nThe Avengers' story in the MCU takes place in the Earth-616 universe. The fictional biography below includes events that happened to the team from more than one Earth-616 timeline, as well as events that occurred in alternate universes.\n\nThe Avengers Initiative\nIn 1995, S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury creates the Avengers Initiative, envisioning it as a group of heroes working to respond to planetary threats, following the appearance of Carol Danvers and naming it after her U.S. Air Force callsign, \"Avenger\". Years later, Fury assesses various individuals for it, including Tony Stark and Steve Rogers. Stark's membership is declined after a negative report by S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Natasha Romanoff. The World Security Council wanted Emil Blonsky to join, but rejected it after Stark deters Thaddeus Ross from the idea, hiring Bruce Banner instead.\n\nThe first assembly\nIn 2012, the Asgardian Loki teleports to the Joint Dark Energy Mission Facility on Earth, where he steals the Tesseract and brainwashes Clint Barton and Dr. Erik Selvig using his scepter. Subsequently, Fury recruits Stark and Banner to locate the Tesseract. Rogers, Romanoff, and Stark apprehend Loki, but are disrupted by Thor's arrival. This leads to confrontations between the group, exacerbated by the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. is using the Tesseract to create weapons of mass destruction. Barton attacks the Helicarrier, causing Banner to transform into the Hulk and cause damage. After Loki kills S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson, the team unites to avenge him, with Romanoff freeing Barton from the scepter's control. Rogers then recruits Barton to the team as a new member. The Avengers, led by Rogers, confront Loki, who opens a wormhole using the Tesseract and begins an invasion with his Chitauri army, starting a battle. Stark introduces the team to Loki by referring to them as \"Earth's Mightiest Heroes\". Eventually, the World Security Council launches a nuclear missile towards Manhattan, but Stark intercepts and flies it through the wormhole, destroying the Chitauri mother ship and stopping the invasion. Romanoff closes the portal with the scepter and the team apprehends Loki, who is taken back to Asgard.\n\nFighting Hydra and Ultron\nThree years after the Battle of New York, Hydra uses Loki's scepter following their infiltration of S.H.I.E.L.D. The Avengers locate it in Sokovia, where they recover it and encounter twin superhuman Hydra test subjects, Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Barton is wounded and Rogers captures Hydra leader Wolfgang von Strucker while Stark retrieves the scepter, despite being subjected to hallucinations by Wanda's telepathy. Stark and Banner unilaterally decide to use the scepter to create the Ultron Program, a sentient artificial intelligence (AI) peacekeeping force. However, Ultron resolves to eradicate humanity.\nIn Africa, the Avengers fight Ultron, now allied with the Maximoffs. Wanda induces telekinetic hallucinations, triggering Banner's transformation into the Hulk before Barton stops her, while Stark stops Hulk's rampage with his Hulkbuster armor. After reconvening at Barton's farmhouse, Rogers, Barton, and Romanoff retrieve a new vibranium body created by Ultron. Stark and Banner use it to create Vision, a sentient and benevolent being powered from the Stark's J.A.R.V.I.S. program, Mjolnir, and the Mind Stone. Ultron tries to use Sokovia as a meteor to cause an extinction event. The Avengers, joined by James Rhodes and the Maximoffs, defeat Ultron's sentries and evacuate civilians. Pietro sacrifices himself to save Barton, while Stark and Thor destroy Sokovia, and Vision fully terminates Ultron to avert the event. In the aftermath, Stark and Barton retire, Banner disappears, and Thor decides to find the Infinity Stones, while Rhodes, Sam Wilson, Wanda, and the Vision join the team. The Avengers relocate their primary headquarters to the Avengers Compound in Upstate New York.\n\nCivil War\nMonths after the Battle of Sokovia, the Avengers' new facility becomes targeted in a heist, with a skirmish between Wilson and Scott Lang. In 2016, Rogers, Romanoff, Maximoff, and Wilson defend a research lab in Lagos from Brock Rumlow. They successfully stop Rumlow and his crew of mercenaries, but Maximoff's usage of telekinesis to try to save civilians kills Wakandan diplomats. Thus, United States Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross presents the Sokovia Accords, United Nations (U.N.) legislation intended to regulate superhumans' activities. The Avengers are divided: Stark, Rhodes, Vision, and Romanoff support it, while Rogers and Wilson object due to fears of authoritarianism.\nAfter Bucky Barnes is accused of killing Wakandan King T'Chaka, Rogers and Wilson protect him from an arrest warrant, causing them to clash with Stark, Rhodes, Romanoff, and T'Challa, T'Chaka's son. After Barnes is detained, Helmut Zemo activates Barnes' Winter Soldier persona using the Winter Soldier Book, although Barnes later recovers and reveals Zemo's interest in the Winter Soldier Program. To aid them, Wilson and Rogers recruit Lang and Barton, then take Maximoff out of confinement at the Avengers Compound. The divided Avengers meet and fight at the Leipzig\/Halle Airport; Rogers, Wilson, Barton, Maximoff, Barnes and Lang clash with Stark, Rhodes, Romanoff, Vision, T'Challa and new recruit Peter Parker.\nRogers and Barnes escape with Romanoff's help, traveling to the Hydra Siberian Facility to stop Zemo from reactivating the Winter Soldier Program. Their teammates are imprisoned in the Raft and Rhodes' legs are paralyzed after accidentally being struck by Vision's blast. Stark joins Rogers and Barnes after realizing Barnes' innocence, but fights them after Zemo reveals Barnes' assassination of Stark's parents. In the fight, Rogers disables Stark's armor and Barnes' cybernetic arm is destroyed. Rogers then abandons his shield. Meanwhile, T'Challa apprehends Zemo, realizing him to be T'Chaka's killer. Rogers later frees his teammates from the Raft, becoming fugitives. Barton and Lang agree to be under house arrest to be with their families. Although officially reduced to just Stark, Vision, and Rhodes, the Avengers continue operating. Stark offers to hire Parker after he defeats Adrian Toomes. However, Parker declines, choosing to remain as Spider-Man, but promises to assist the Avengers if needed. In 2018, Wade Wilson \/ Deadpool travels from his universe, Earth-10005, to Earth-616 \/ the \"Sacred Timeline\" hoping to join the Avengers and give his life added meaning. He is interviewed by Happy Hogan, who rejects him, and returns to his own universe.\n\nThe Blip\nIn 2018, the Avengers come into conflict with Thanos and his children, who seek the six Infinity Stones to erase half of the universe's life. Thanos hijacks a spaceship containing Asgardian refugees, killing Loki and subduing Thor. Thanos defeats Hulk, who is transported to Earth by Heimdall to inform Stephen Strange, the keeper of the Time Stone, of Thanos' arrival. Banner, Strange, and Wong, joined by Stark and Parker, confront two of his children in Greenwich Village. With Banner unable to transform to aid in the fight, Strange is captured and taken to their spaceship, while Banner warns Rogers of Thanos' intention to acquire Vision's Mind Stone. Stark and Parker pursue Strange and board the spaceship, where Stark officially anoints Parker as an Avenger. They go to Titan to confront Thanos, allying with the Guardians of the Galaxy along the way. The two teams temporarily restrain Thanos in an ensuing battle to take his Infinity Gauntlet off, now with four Stones. However, Peter Quill hits Thanos after learning he killed Gamora, freeing and allowing Thanos to incapacitate the group. With Thanos preparing to kill Stark, Strange surrenders the Time Stone to save his life.\nMeanwhile, Maximoff and Vision, now in a relationship and hiding out in Edinburgh, are ambushed by two more of Thanos' children, resulting in Vision getting wounded. Rogers, Romanoff, and Wilson arrive and help. Returning to the Avengers Compound, they meet Rhodes and Banner to discuss Thanos. Vision proposes to be destroyed to prevent Thanos from acquiring the Mind Stone, but Maximoff refuses and the team travel to Wakanda, where Shuri begins an operation to safely remove the Stone. The Wakandan army, their allies, and Barnes aid the Avengers to repel an invasion by Thanos' children. Thor arrives on the battlefield alongside Rocket and Groot through the Bifrost after forging his new Stormbreaker axe on Nidavellir. Shuri is ambushed, stopping the operation, but the Avengers eventually kill Thanos' children. When Thanos arrives, the Avengers delay him while Maximoff kills Vision to destroy the Mind Stone. Maximoff is successful, but Thanos uses the Time Stone to undo her actions and retrieve the Stone, killing Vision again. With a full Gauntlet, Thanos initiates the Blip. Wilson, Barnes, Maximoff, Strange, Parker, T'Challa, Groot, Quill, Drax, and Mantis are blipped, leaving Stark and Nebula stranded on Titan while Thanos escapes. Fury and Maria Hill are blipped as they try to find the Avengers, but Fury manages to contact Danvers. Barton's family also blipped during his house arrest, causing him to become vengeful vigilante Ronin and murder criminals. Lang gets trapped in the Quantum Realm while harvesting energy, as Hank Pym, Hope, and Janet van Dyne get blipped prior to extracting him.\n\nReversing the Blip\nThree weeks later, the Avengers reunite after Stark and Nebula are rescued by Danvers. The Avengers find Thanos' location, where Rogers, Romanoff, Banner, Thor, Danvers, Rhodes, Rocket, and Nebula ambush him. Thanos reveals he destroyed the Stones, prompting Thor to decapitate him.\nBy 2023, Romanoff becomes the leader of the Avengers, officially recruiting Danvers, Rocket, and Nebula to the team. The Avengers collaborate with Okoye to mitigate the Blip's damage. Rogers becomes a grief counselor, Stark lives with his wife Pepper Potts and daughter Morgan, Thor becomes an overweight alcoholic afflicted with depression, while Banner integrates his intelligence within the Hulk's body. Lang escapes the Quantum Realm and visits Rogers and Romanoff at the Compound, proposing to use the Quantum Realm for time travel to undo the Blip. They visit Stark and Banner to discuss it, but Stark rejects it while Banner's tests with Pym's Quantum Tunnel fail. Stark eventually helps them, providing Pym Particles for time traveling. Banner and Rocket travel to New Asgard, Norway to recruit Thor, while Romanoff recruits Barton in Tokyo. They all reconvene and form a plan to conduct a time traveling operation to retrieve each Stone from the best years and locations.\nBanner, Rogers, Stark, and Lang travel to New York City in 2012: Banner gets the Time Stone from the Ancient One after revealing Strange's surrendering of it, Rogers finds the Mind Stone in Loki's scepter, while Stark and Lang fail to get the Space Stone, but Stark and Rogers get it by going back to 1970. Thor and Rocket retrieve the Reality Stone from Asgard in 2013, while Rhodes and Nebula retrieve the Power Stone from Morag in 2014. There, 2014-Thanos learns of the Blip and the Avengers' plan to undo it, so he kidnaps 2023-Nebula and replaces her with 2014-Nebula to sabotage the operation. Barton gets the Soul Stone after Romanoff sacrifices herself on Vormir.\nReuniting in 2023, the Avengers place the Stones into the newly made Nano Gauntlet. Then, Banner snaps with the gauntlet on, undoing the Blip. Meanwhile, 2014-Nebula transports 2014-Thanos, his warship, and 2014-Gamora to 2023, destroying the Avengers Compound. 2023-Nebula kills 2014-Nebula after failing to convince her to betray Thanos. Thanos overpowers Stark, Thor, and Rogers and directs his army to obtain the Stones, intent on creating a new \"grateful\" universe. Strange creates portals, allowing the restored Avengers and their allies to arrive to fight Thanos and his army. Maximoff overpowers Thanos and almost kills him, forcing him to call for his warship to fire missiles onto the ground. Danvers arrives and destroys the warship, but he knocks her out in a confrontation using the Power Stone and seizes the Nano Gauntlet. Stark confronts Thanos and steals the Stones from the Gauntlet with his armor, snapping his fingers to disintegrate Thanos and his army, but the radiation kills Stark.\nAfter the battle, Fury sends Skrulls to collect blood samples on the battlefield including some of the Avengers, combining it into one concoction known as the Harvest.\n\nDisbandment\nThe Avengers and their allies attend Stark's funeral at Stark's house. Afterwards, they disband. Rogers travels back into the Quantum Realm to return the Stones to their respective universes and travels back in time to be with Peggy Carter. Having lived out a life with Peggy, Rogers returns as an old man with a new shield and grants it and the title of Captain America to Wilson. Thor appoints Valkyrie as the new ruler of New Asgard and goes to space with the Guardians of the Galaxy. Maximoff goes to Florida and sees that Vision's body is in S.W.O.R.D. custody at their headquarters. She then travels to Westview, New Jersey and in her grief over the trauma she endured throughout her life, recently with the loss of Vision and her home, the Avengers Compound, creates a Hex trapping the town in a sitcom called WandaVision and creating twin boys and another Vision. She learns she is the mythical Scarlet Witch and embraces her powers. Vision, who was taken into S.W.O.R.D. custody, is reactivated, through remnants of Maximoff's magic on a drone, and sports an all white appearance. \nWilson returns to help out in the United States Air Force. In 2024, with Barnes' reassurance, Wilson takes up the mantle of Captain America and gives his Falcon wings and mantle to his Air Force friend, Joaquin Torres. Also in 2024, Banner and Danvers answer Wong's hologram call and meet Shang-Chi. Banner welcomes Shang-Chi onto the team. Later that year, Banner aids his cousin Jennifer Walters after she receives his abilities following a blood cross-contamination in a car accident. In 2025, Banner travels to Sakaar to bring his son, Skaar, to Earth. Barton returns to live with his family at their Iowa farm. In December 2024, Barton and his children go to New York City before Christmas to see a Broadway musical about Rogers' legacy. While there, he meets Kate Bishop and her golden retriever, Lucky. He takes her in as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and they become Barton's extended family. In 2025, the first annual \"AvengerCon\" is held at Camp Lehigh to honor the Avengers. Lang becomes a celebrity while spending time with his family, starts the Big Me Little Me podcast, and writes his bestselling memoir Look Out for the Little Guy. In 2026, Lang, his daughter Cassie, Hope, Pym, and Janet are transported into the Quantum Realm where they encounter Kang the Conqueror, who forces Lang to help him escape. They successfully defeat Kang and return home. However, the Council of Kangs, overseeing the multiverse outside of space and time, note that Earth-616's Avengers are becoming aware of the multiverse and must be stopped.\n\nAlternate versions\nOther versions of the Avengers are depicted within the context of the MCU multiverse, such as in Avengers: Endgame and the animated series What If...?.\n\nAlternate 2012 timeline\nIn an alternate 2012, Rogers, Stark, Banner, Thor, Barton, and Romanoff assemble in the Battle of New York. After subduing Loki at Stark Tower, Thor puts a device over Loki's mouth after he mocks Rogers. Romanoff and Barton give the Scepter to Brock Rumlow and other agents.

Director Nick Fury is the creator of the Avengers and assists them numerous times.\nPhil Coulson contributes to the Avengers' creation as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent serving Fury. Fury described him as being as much of an Avenger as the superheroes.\nS.H.I.E.L.D. assists the Avengers in the Battle of New York. Even after its collapse, S.H.I.E.L.D. agents like Maria Hill fight alongside the Avengers in the Battle of Sokovia.\nErik Selvig and Helen Cho begin working for the Avengers during the events of Age of Ultron.\nT'Challa \/ Black Panther and Bucky Barnes \/ Winter Soldier fight alongside the Avengers during the Avengers Civil War, the Battle of Wakanda, and the battle at the Avengers Compound.\nIndividuals such as Ayo, Drax, Groot, Mantis, M'Baku, Okoye, Shuri, Peter Quill \/ Star-Lord, Dr. Stephen Strange, and Wong with the rest of the Wakandan army including Dora Milaje fight alongside the Avengers during the Infinity War and the battle at the Avengers Compound.\nIndividuals such as Howard the Duck, Korg, Kraglin Obfonteri, Miek, Pepper Potts, Valkyrie, Hope van Dyne \/ Wasp, the Masters of the Mystic Arts, the Ravagers, and the rest of the Asgardian army fight alongside the Avengers in the battle at the Avengers Compound.\n\nConcept and creation\nInitial castings\nSamuel L. Jackson makes his debut in a cameo appearance as Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D., in a post-credits scene in Iron Man. Jackson's face was previously used as the model for the Ultimate Marvel imprint version of Nick Fury. Jackson confirmed that he had been in discussions to reprise the role of Fury from Iron Man's post-credits scene in the film's sequel, but that contract disputes were making a deal difficult. Jackson stated, \"There was a huge kind of negotiation that broke down. I don't know. Maybe I won't be Nick Fury\". In February 2009, Jackson and Marvel came to terms, and he was signed to play the character in up to nine films.\n\nDirector Jon Favreau planned to cast a newcomer in the title role in Iron Man (2008), as \"those movies don't require an expensive star; Iron Man's the star, the superhero is the star. The success of X-Men (2000) and Spider-Man (2002) without being star-driven pieces reassures [executives] that the film does have an upside commercially\". However, before the screenplay was prepared, he had approached Sam Rockwell to play the part. Rockwell had interest, but Favreau changed his decision after the screen test of Robert Downey Jr. In September 2006, Downey was cast in the role. Favreau chose Downey, a fan of the comic, because he felt the actor's past made him an appropriate choice for the part, explaining \"The best and worst moments of Robert's life have been in the public eye. He had to find an inner balance to overcome obstacles that went far beyond his career. That's Tony Stark\". Favreau faced opposition from Marvel in casting Downey, but advocated for his casting, saying that \"It was my job as a director to show that it was the best choice creatively. Downey earned $500,000 for the role. Marvel entered into early talks with Emily Blunt to play Natasha Romanoff \/ Black Widow, though she was unable to take the role due to a previous commitment to star in Gulliver's Travels (2010). In February 2009, Scarlett Johansson signed on for the role. Her deal included options for multiple films, including potentially The Avengers. Prior to her casting, Johansson had also researched other Marvel characters she could play, including the Blonde Phantom and the Wasp.\nIn October 2008, Daniel Craig was offered the role of Thor, but ultimately turned it down, citing his commitments to the James Bond franchise. In February 2009, a casting call went out looking for actors with certain physical attributes to audition for the role of Thor. That May, Chris Hemsworth was in negotiations to portray the title role after a back-and-forth process in which he was refused early on, then given a second chance to read for the part. Hemsworth's brother, Liam, also auditioned, but was rejected by Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige. That month, Tom Hiddleston was cast as Loki, the brother of Thor, and later the main villain of The Avengers. He originally auditioned for the role of Thor. Kevin McKidd was also considered for the role. The casting process for The Avengers continued into much of 2010, with the addition of Jeremy Renner.\nIn March 2010, it was reported that Chris Evans was cast as Steve Rogers \/ Captain America. Ryan Phillippe and John Krasinski were also considered for the role. In April 2010, Sebastian Stan, who had been mentioned in media accounts as a possibility for the title role, was cast as Barnes. Mark Ruffalo was cast as Bruce Banner \/ Hulk by July 2010 to replace Edward Norton, who played the role in The Incredible Hulk. \"Our decision is definitely not one based on monetary factors, but instead rooted in the need for an actor who embodies the creativity and collaborative spirit of our other talented cast members\" stated Feige. In response, Norton's agent Brian Swardstrom decried Feige's statement, calling it \"purposefully misleading\" and an \"inappropriate attempt to paint our client in a negative light\". In October 2014, Norton claimed it was his own decision never to play Hulk again because he \"wanted more diversity\" with his career, and did not want to be associated with only one character.\n\nBackground and development\nThe Avengers\nIn the mid-2000s, Feige realized that Marvel still owned the rights to the core members of the Avengers. Feige, a self-professed \"fanboy\", envisioned creating a shared universe just as creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby had done with their comic books in the early 1960s. Ideas for a film based on the Avengers began in 2003, with Avi Arad, the CEO of Marvel Studios, first announcing plans to develop the film in April 2005. This followed Marvel Enterprises declaring independence by allying with Merrill Lynch to produce a slate of films that would be distributed by Paramount Pictures. Marvel discussed their plans in a brief presentation to Wall Street analysts; the studio's intention was to release films for each main character to establish their identities and familiarize audiences with them before a crossover film. Screenwriter Zak Penn, who wrote The Incredible Hulk (2008), which introduced Bruce Banner \/ Hulk, became attached to the film in 2006 and was hired by Marvel Studios to write The Avengers in June 2007. In the wake of the 2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike, Marvel negotiated with the Writers Guild of America to ensure that it could create films based on its comic book counterparts, including Captain America, Ant-Man and the Avengers. After the successful release of Iron Man in May, which introduced Tony Stark \/ Iron Man, the company set a July 2011 release date for The Avengers. In September 2008, Marvel Studios reached an agreement with Paramount\u2014an extension of a previous partnership\u2014which gave the company distribution rights for five future Marvel films.\nIn October 2008, two major prospects occurred for Marvel Studios: Favreau was brought in as an executive producer for the film, and the company signed a long-term lease with Raleigh Studios to produce three additional big-budget films alongside The Avengers at their Manhattan Beach, California complex. The films were Iron Man 2 (2010), introducing Romanoff, Thor introducing Thor and a cameo appearance of Barton, and Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), introducing Rogers. Favreau stated that he would not direct the film, but would \"definitely have input and a say\". Favreau expressed concerns about combining characters such as Iron Man and Thor, noting Iron Man's character was based around technology, while the inclusion of Thor would require the introduction of supernatural elements, which he said would require \"a lot of thoughtfulness to make that all work and not blow the reality that we've created\". In March 2009, Marvel announced that the film's release date had been pushed back to May 4, 2012, almost a full year later.\nIn July 2009, Penn talked about the crossover process, desiring to \"kind of shuttle between the different movies\" while emulating the structure of comic books to ensure the films were connected. He also wanted to use animatics wherever possible to help visualize the film and used the same board so that the team was \"working off the same visual ideas\". At first, Penn tried to reduce Thor's role in the script because he had doubts about the character's ability to succeed on film, but changed his mind once Hemsworth was cast. The film had always intended to use Loki as its villain, but Penn noted that early discussion had considered using Red Skull.\nIn January 2010, Feige was asked if it would be difficult to meld the fantasy of Thor with the high-tech science fiction in Iron Man and The Avengers. He rejected the notion and said the creative team would hew closer to the \"Jack Kirby\/Stan Lee\/Walt Simonson\/J. Michael Straczynski\" interpretation of Thor rather than focus on Thor as depicted in Norse mythology, while additionally affirming the Thor film would help familiarize audiences with the character. In March, it was reported that Penn had completed the first draft of the script, and that Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada and Avengers comic-book writer Brian Michael Bendis had received copies. In July, Joss Whedon signed on to direct and replace Penn as the film's writer. On his desire to take on the film, he explained that the core of the movie was about \"finding yourself from community\" and the togetherness derived from a group that ultimately doesn't belong together.\nWhen Whedon received Penn's draft, he told Feige he felt the studio did not \"have anything\" and they should \"pretend this draft never happened\". Part of Whedon's issue was the lack of character connections in Penn's draft, which necessitated Whedon to begin \"at square one\". Whedon went on to write a five-page treatment of his plan for the film, and created the tagline \"Avengers: Some Assembly Required\", a humorous play on the \"Avengers Assemble\" slogan from the comic books. Marvel quickly began working to hire Whedon to write and direct, only mandating that Loki be the antagonist, a battle featuring the Avengers and villains take place, and the film to be completed prior to its May 2012 release. The script would go through \"a lot of insane iterations of what might be\" according to Whedon. Whedon explained there was a point when it was not certain Johansson would star in the film, so he wrote pages featuring the Wasp, and wanted Zooey Deschanel to play the character. He also was \"worried that one British character actor [Hiddleston] was not enough to take on Earth's mightiest heroes, and that we'd feel like we were rooting for the overdog\", thus choosing to add Ezekiel Stane, Obadiah Stane's son, into a new draft. Once all of the actors were \"locked in place the movie stayed on mission\". Whedon noted that the characters used do not have the same issue, unlike the X-Men. He felt \"these guys just don't belong together\" before modeling their interactions based on the film The Dirty Dozen (1967). Whedon also referenced Dr. Strangelove (1964), The Abyss (1989), His Girl Friday (1940), and Black Hawk Down (2001). Whedon would ultimately share final screenplay credit with Penn, though Whedon noted he \"fought\" for sole credit and was \"very upset about it\". Penn felt the two \"could have collaborated more, but that was not his choice. He wanted to do it his way, and I respect that\".\n\nAge of Ultron\nIn May 2012, after the successful release of the first Avengers film, Disney CEO Bob Iger announced a sequel was in development. Most of the film's cast members were under contract to potentially appear in the sequel; however, Robert Downey Jr. was not, as his four-picture deal with Marvel expired after Iron Man 3 (2013). By May 2013, Downey had entered negotiations to extend his contract with Marvel Studios and reprise his role as Iron Man in the film. A month later, Downey signed on to return for the then-untitled Avengers sequel, as well as a third Avengers film.\nAt the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con, Whedon was unsure about directing. However, in August 2012, Iger announced that Whedon would return to write and direct. Later in the month, Disney set a May 1, 2015, release date. At the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con, Whedon announced the film would be subtitled Age of Ultron. Despite the subtitle, the film is not based on the comic book miniseries Age of Ultron (2013). Feige explained that they simply liked the title but the plot was taken from various Avengers story arcs.  At the Hollywood premiere of Iron Man 3, Whedon said that he had completed a draft of the script, started the storyboard process, and met with actors. Whedon included a \"brother\/sister act\" from the comic books, later revealed to be Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. His rationale for their inclusion was that \"their powers are very visually interesting\", with problems; those powers are superspeed, and spells and telekinesis, respectively, though cautioned he was not throwing in more characters for the sake of doing that. Whedon stated that the twins, who do not approve of the Avengers, allowed him to add more conflict, noting \"the Avengers are like a world power, and not everybody's on board with the Avengers coming in and starting fights, even in the name of justice\". As Marvel Studios shared the film rights to Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch with 20th Century Fox, they had to avoid contradicting elements from Fox's X-Men films, Whedon introduced the two characters into the MCU completely based on his terms for the first time, allowing him to connect their origin stories and avoid the concept of mutants. Whedon enjoyed the storytelling opportunities from introducing a character with telepathic powers, explaining \"it meant we could spend a little time inside the Avengers' heads\u2014either their past or their impressions of what's going on, or their fears, or all of the above\". Whedon added that Ultron's origin would differ from the comics, with Hank Pym not being involved in Ultron's creation. Whedon disclosed that Edgar Wright was using the character first in his film Ant-Man (2015), then in development. He also thought that Ultron needed to be conceived through the Avengers and since they already had Tony Stark and Bruce Banner on the team; it would not make sense to bring in a third scientist.\nCasting continued into August 2013, with the announcement that James Spader would play the villain of the film, Ultron. That November Marvel confirmed that Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson would play the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, respectively. Taylor-Johnson had been in negotiations since as early as June, while Olsen's potential involvement was first reported in August. By the end of the year, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Samuel L. Jackson, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, and Cobie Smulders were confirmed to be reprising their roles from the first film, and Don Cheadle, who portrayed James Rhodes in the Iron Man films, was joining. In the early months of 2014, Paul Bettany, who voiced J.A.R.V.I.S. in previous MCU films, was cast as the Vision. Whedon noted the differences between the characters, explaining that \"They're very disparate characters. The joy of the Avengers is they really don't belong in the same room. It's not like the X-Men, who are all tortured by the same thing and have similar costumes\".\nFeige revealed that Captain Marvel, who headlined her own MCU film in 2019, appeared in an early draft of the screenplay, but was removed since the character was not yet cast, saying, \"We didn't want to introduce her fully formed flying in a costume before you knew who she was or how she came to be\". Whedon shot visual effects plates for Captain Marvel to fly into Avengers Headquarters at the end of the film; those shots were instead repurposed for Wanda Maximoff. Feige also revealed that an early draft had Hulk's Quinjet detected near Saturn at the end of the film, but it was decided to keep it Earth-based and leave his fate ambiguous to dispel rumors that a film based on the \"Planet Hulk\" storyline was in development, which Marvel Studios had no plans to adapt at the time. Marvel later adapted elements of \"Planet Hulk\" in Thor: Ragnarok (2017), where Hulk retroactively landed in Sakaar after the events of Age of Ultron.\n\nCaptain America: Civil War\nIn March 2014, Anthony and Joe Russo confirmed that they had signed on to return as directors for a third Captain America film, with Evans as Captain America, Feige as producer, and Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely as screenwriters. Markus and McFeely had been working on the screenplay since late 2013, while the Russo brothers began work in February 2014. In April 2014, Marvel announced a release date of May 6, 2016. In July, Markus and McFeely stated that they were midway through a first draft for the film, on which principal photography was expected to begin in April 2015.\nBy October, Robert Downey Jr. had entered final negotiations to reprise his role as Stark in the film. Downey was added for the film to adapt the 2006\u201307 \"Civil War\" comic book storyline written by Mark Millar, which pitted Iron Man against Captain America. At the end of the month, it was confirmed that Sebastian Stan would return as Bucky Barnes \/ Winter Soldier. A few days later, Marvel revealed that the film would be titled Captain America: Civil War, confirming Downey's appearance and announcing that Chadwick Boseman would appear in the film as T'Challa \/ Black Panther ahead of his own solo film. In November, Daniel Br\u00fchl joined the cast as Helmut Zemo, while Anthony Mackie was confirmed to return as Sam Wilson \/ Falcon. Following the November 2014 hacking of Sony Pictures' computers, emails between Sony Pictures Entertainment co-chairman Amy Pascal and president Doug Belgrad were released stating that Marvel wanted to include Spider-Man, whose film rights are licensed to Sony, but talks between the studios were believed to have been terminated. However, by February 2015, the studios reached a licensing deal for the use of Spider-Man in an MCU film, indicated the character would appear in Civil War. The Russos stated they were lobbying for months to include the character in the film. In January 2015, the Russo brothers confirmed that Johansson would reprise her role in the film. Two months later, Renner was confirmed to be reprising his role. Additionally, Olsen revealed she would also reprise her role in the film. Feige also revealed that Hope van Dyne was in an original draft of the film, after receiving the Wasp costume at the end of Ant-Man, but was cut because \"there are so many characters in Civil War that we didn't want to do her a disservice,\" saying Marvel was \"saving\" the character for a better environment to reveal van Dyne in the Wasp costume for the first time and see \"her dynamic with Scott [Lang] in a way it could play out\".\nAnthony Russo stated that adapting the \"Civil War\" storyline was not always the intended storyline and direction for the film when the brothers initially signed on to return as directors. Markus expanded on this, saying the original concept for a third Captain America film \"never got to draft\", with Feige at some point telling the writing team to begin adapting \"Civil War\" around their original ideas. McFeely also added that, despite the shift in direction for the film, \"The central theme, even the way Zemo is operating, are from that [early] iteration\". McFeely said that the idea of basing a film on \"Civil War\" had \"been on and off the table for a while\" at Marvel Studios, explaining, \"it's a challenge to do it and make sure that all the characters that we've established, and everyone's established in the MCU are serviced and sound correct. Because there's a difference between the characters in \"Civil War\", which was written in 2006, 2007. The MCU doesn't exist [when it was written]. There isn't a Robert Downey Jr. or Chris Evans who has helped create the character[s] so we need to make sure that that template gets adjusted\". Joe Russo added that the \"essence\" of \"Civil War\" was used, such as \"the concept of registration\" and the notion that heroes need to be either supervised being applicable. Anthony Russo further went on to comment that superhero registration could become a political issue, wanting to avoid that and instead \"figure out very personal reasons why everyone's relationship to this idea of registration is going to become complicated\", particularly by focusing on Steve and Bucky's.\nExecutives at Marvel Entertainment balked at the idea of Captain America and Iron Man coming to blows at the end of the film and wanted the Avengers to unite to fight Zemo and the super-soldiers at the Hydra base in Siberia instead. The Russos were not happy with this idea, with Joe Russo saying, \"There's nothing interesting about that film. We're not here to make that movie. We're not interested in telling another superhero story\". Feige supported the Russos, who were going to leave the film if the changes were mandated on them. This prompted Walt Disney Studios head Alan F. Horn to back the Russos with making the film as originally intended and lead to Marvel Studios to be placed from Marvel Entertainment into Walt Disney Studios in 2015.\n\nInfinity War and Endgame\nThanos, a villain who covets the Infinity Stones, was introduced to the MCU in a brief appearance at the end of The Avengers. Many fans subsequently expected Thanos to be the antagonist of Age of Ultron. However, Joss Whedon explained that the character would not be the primary antagonist until a later film due to his power, opting to save him for \"the big finale\". Thanos appears at the end of Age of Ultron in another brief appearance, shown with the Infinity Gauntlet, a glove designed to hold the Infinity Stones.\n\nIn July 2014, Feige said there were \"some notions\" as to where Marvel would want to take a third Avengers film, and the studio was aiming for three years between Age of Ultron in 2015 and a sequel. In October 2014, Marvel announced a two-part sequel to Age of Ultron titled Avengers: Infinity War. Part 1 was scheduled to be released on May 4, 2018, and Part 2 was scheduled for May 3, 2019. Whedon was \"very doubtful\" that he would be involved with the two films by January 2015.\nThe Russo brothers reached a deal by April 2015 to direct both parts of Avengers: Infinity War, after previously directing the MCU films Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War. A month later, Markus and McFeely had signed on to also return from the Captain America films, writing the screenplays for both parts. McFeely later recalled that the pair had started negotiating to write the two films without ever actually being asked to do so by Feige or Marvel. Anthony Russo described the two Avengers sequels as the culmination of all the MCU films since Iron Man, bringing an end to some things and beginning others. Marvel called this overall storyline \"The Infinity Saga\", comprising Phases One, Two, and Three of the MCU. In April 2016, Jon Favreau said he would executive produce the films after doing the same for the previous Avengers films and also directing the first two Iron Man films. Gunn also served as executive producer on the films, working with the Russos, Marvel, and Feige to ensure the Guardians of the Galaxy characters were \"well taken care of\" in the films. In March 2018, Disney moved the first film's United States release to April 27, 2018, so it would be released on the same weekend in the U.S. as in several international markets. That December, the release of the second film was changed to April 26, 2019. In July 2016, Marvel announced that Part 1 would simply be known as Avengers: Infinity War and Part 2 would be called the Untitled Avengers film until a title was chosen. By December 2018, the second film's title was revealed to be Avengers: Endgame.\nIn June 2013, Robert Downey Jr. signed on to return as Tony Stark \/ Iron Man for a third Avengers film, and Josh Brolin signed a multi-film deal the following May, to play Thanos. In July 2014, Feige stated that actors from previous MCU films were under contract to return to for a third Avengers film, with Jeremy Renner stating that September he signed on to reprise the role of Barton. After the announcement of Infinity War and Endgame, many established MCU actors were confirmed to be joining Downey and Brolin, including Hemsworth, Ruffalo, Evans, Johansson, Cheadle, Bettany, Olsen, and Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson \/ Falcon. Infinity War also sees the Avengers unite with the Guardians of the Galaxy, including Karen Gillan as Nebula and Bradley Cooper as the voice of Rocket.\nAdditional actors reprising their roles in Infinity War from the various MCU franchises include Benedict Cumberbatch as Stephen Strange from Doctor Strange (2016), Tom Holland as Peter Parker \/ Spider-Man from Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), and Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa \/ Black Panther from Captain America: Civil War and Black Panther, with Danai Gurira as Okoye from the latter. Sebastian Stan also appears as Bucky Barnes \/ Winter Soldier from the Captain America films. Jackson and Smulders also reprised their roles in uncredited cameos in the post-credits scene.\nActors who returned for Endgame include: Downey, Hemsworth, Ruffalo, Evans, Johansson, Cumberbatch, Cheadle, Holland, Boseman, Olsen, Mackie, Stan, Gillan, Cooper, and Brolin. Olsen was not contractually obliged to return due to Infinity War fulfilling her original three-film contract with Marvel, but Feige persuaded her to return in Endgame by pitching her the concept of the then-upcoming Disney+ series WandaVision (2021). They were also joined by Renner as Barton, Evangeline Lilly as Hope van Dyne, Paul Rudd as Scott Lang, and Brie Larson as Carol Danvers.\n\nDifferences from the comics\nWhile the name \"Avengers\" and the depiction of Loki as the first antagonist is derived more from the mainstream Marvel Universe, commonly referred to as \"Earth-616\", other different depictions such as the original formation of the Avengers at the hands of S.H.I.E.L.D. along with the depicted original lineup and the portrayal of the aliens known as Chitauri as main antagonists were portrayed with a similar premise as the Ultimates, a modern reimagining of the Avengers within the comic book universe within the multiverse that is published by Marvel Comics. The original lineup of the Avengers included Hank Pym and the Wasp instead of Captain America, Black Widow and Hawkeye. The Ultimates introduced the same lineup of The Avengers with the Earth-616's version and the addition of Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, both of whom later appeared in Age of Ultron. The characters Rocket Raccoon and Nebula do not feature as Avengers members in the comics, differing from the film adaptations.\n\nReception\nCritics praised the team's introduction as the main highlight of The Avengers. A. O. Scott of The New York Times felt the chemistry of the characters was the best part of the film. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly commented that the best thing regarding the film  \"is that it also unleashes them on each other. Simply put: These freaks of goodness may be a team, but they don't like one another very much\". Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal opined that the depiction of them quarreling among themselves comically was the most fun part as depicted in the original film. The team once again mostly received praise in the sequel with critics praising the original cast reprising the role in Age of Ultron. Scott Foundas of Variety felt that the actors now \"wear these roles as comfortably as second skins\". He noted the Fantastic Four and Justice League as teams that can only hope to follow in the footsteps regarding the portrayal of the characters. Conversely, Scott Mendelson of Forbes disliked the concept that some of the Avengers (Tony Stark and Bruce Banner) were behind the creation of the antagonist of the film (Ultron).\nThe depiction of the Avengers being divided in a Civil War as shown in Captain America: Civil War was praised by critics such as Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian and Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times. However, Nicholas Barber of the BBC  was more critical of the depiction, opining that their allegiance didn't make sense. Additionally, Stephen Whitty of the New York Daily News was critical of the expansion of many heroes taking sides. The film was referred to as \"Avengers 2.5\" by commentators and fans, given the ensemble nature of the cast resembled that of the Avengers films, and the fact that the film no longer felt centered around Captain America. Feige responded by saying \"What's fun about Civil War though is, as you know from the comics, it's a very simple story. And it really has to be, to accommodate that many players\".\nIn 2018, around the time that Infinity War  came out, film director James Cameron started a new term called \"Avengers fatigue\" that circulated online. Cameron told IndieWire that despite being a fan of the films, he feared that they had dominated the film genre, and that he hoped that people were getting tired of it so other stories could be told. This resulted in some criticism and backlash online regarding Cameron. The fourth Avengers film, Avengers: Endgame, was praised as a proper conclusion for the superhero team.\n\nThemes and analysis\nAccording to film critic Peter Travers, The Avengers director Joss Whedon \"sees the Avengers as the ultimate dysfunctional family. Their powers have estranged them from the normal world. As a result, they're lonely, cranky, emotional fuck-ups, which the actors have a ball playing\". Also while reviewing the original Avengers films, Roger Ebert compared the original six lineup of the Avengers as uniquely different much like the assortment of dog breeds that consists of champions of the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. He noted that both examples \"are completely different\" but \"yet they're all champions\". Anthony Lane of The New Yorker explained that the superhero group was reminiscent to the supergroup Traveling Wilburys in music pop-culture. Callie Ahlgrim of Insider Inc. described the Avengers as \"the most ambitious superpowered team in cinematic history\" when doing a rank down of most powerful Avengers within the MCU.\n\nCultural impact\nBefore the MCU built up to the Avengers, shared film universes were virtually unheard of in Hollywood according to Tom Russo of Boston.com, with few exceptions like Alien vs. Predator (2004). Since the release of The Avengers, the shared universe model created by Marvel Studios has begun to be replicated by other film studios that held rights to other comic book characters, notably DC Entertainment and Warner Bros. Pictures. Warner Bros. announced their plans to release a Justice League film following a legal victory over Joe Shuster's estate for the rights to Superman. The planned film would unite DC Comics superheroes such as Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman. The company was expected to take the opposite approach to Marvel, releasing individual films for the characters after they have appeared in a team-up film.\nIn November 2012, 20th Century Fox announced plans to create their own shared universe, consisting of Marvel properties that it holds the rights to including the Fantastic Four and X-Men, with the hiring of Mark Millar as supervising producer. X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014) was Fox's first step towards expanding their stable of Marvel properties and creating this universe, ahead of the release of a Fantastic Four reboot film the next year. In November 2013, Sony Pictures Entertainment Co-chairman Amy Pascal announced that the studio intended to expand their universe created within Marc Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man series, with spin-off adventures for supporting characters, in an attempt to replicate Marvel and Disney's model. The next month, Sony announced Venom and Sinister Six films, both set in the Amazing Spider-Man universe. With this announcement, IGN stated that the spin-offs are \"the latest example of what we can refer to as \"the Avengers effect\" in Hollywood, as studios work to build interlocking movie universes\".\n\nThe team was the inspiration behind the documentary series Marvel's Avengers: Building A Cinematic Universe in 2012. Another documentary series was created in 2014 titled Marvel Studios: Assembling a Universe. An online exhibition called Avengers S.T.A.T.I.O.N. based on the team is currently located in Las Vegas, Xi'an, and S\u00e3o Paulo, with a planned upcoming one in Dallas. Avengers Campus, a series of attractions at various Disney Parks, is inspired by the MCU's Avengers, although it is an alternate version of the team. The first of these Campuses opened on June 4, 2021, at Disney California Adventure. In March 2018, the Walt Disney Company announced a new Avengers Campus for Disneyland Paris' Walt Disney Studios Park. The area includes a reimagined attraction where riders team up with Iron Man and other Avengers on a \"hyper-kinetic adventure\", and opened on July 20, 2022. In July 2021, the immersive family dining experience \"Avengers: Quantum Encounter\" at the Worlds of Marvel restaurant on the Disney Wish cruise ship was announced, which debuted when the cruise began voyages on July 14, 2022. The experience takes place during dinner with interactive elements and a full CGI recreation of the Wish's upper decks.\n\nBox-office performance\nThe Avengers franchise is the third highest-grossing superhero franchise and the sixth highest-grossing film franchise of all-time at the worldwide box office, grossing over US$7.7 billion. Endgame is currently the second highest-grossing film of all time, only behind Avatar (2009). Endgame became the number one film in July 2019, surpassing Avatar, however, Avatar was re-released in China in March 2021, reclaiming its top spot.\n\nFuture\nThe Avengers are set to return in two additional films, Avengers: Doomsday (2026) and Avengers: Secret Wars (2027). Both films will be part of the MCU's Phase Six, concluding the Multiverse Saga.\n\nIn other media\nLiterature\nThe book Wakanda Files: A Technological Exploration of the Avengers and Beyond (2020) focuses on the Avengers heroes from Shuri's perspective. Marvel Comics published Dan Abnett's Avengers: Everybody Wants To Rule The World (2015) as a tie-in to Avengers: Age of Ultron. The lineup in the book includes Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Quicksilver, the Scarlet Witch, and the Vision.\n\nVideo games and virtual reality\nLego Marvel's Avengers (2016) was released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, Nintendo 3DS, Wii U, Xbox One, Xbox 360, Macintosh, and Microsoft Windows. The story mainly focuses on the plots of The Avengers and Age of Ultron, but also includes individual levels for Captain America: The First Avenger, Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World (2013), and Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014). Marvel's Avengers features multiple MCU suit skins inspired from the Iron Spider armor from Infinity War, while 2018's Spider-Man also features the Iron Spider armor.\nIn October 2019, Marvel Studios and ILMxLAB announced the virtual reality experience Avengers: Damage Control. It was available for a limited time starting in mid-October 2019 at select Void VR locations until the end of the year. ESPN and Marvel collaborated to create an alternate presentation that featured the Avengers among other Marvel superheroes entitled NBA Special Edition Presented by State Farm: Marvel's Arena of Heroes during the NBA playoff of the Golden State Warriors and the New Orleans Pelicans in May 2021.\n\nSee also\nCharacters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe\nTeams and organizations of the Marvel Cinematic Universe\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\nAvengers on Marvel Cinematic Universe Wiki, an external wiki\nAvengers on Marvel Database, a Marvel Comics wiki\nAvengers on Marvel.com","33":"The Avengers are a superhero team created by Marvel Comics that appear in comic books.

Captain America was discovered trapped in ice in issue #4, and joined the group after they revived him.\nThe Avengers are an all-star ensemble cast of established superhero characters from the Marvel Comics portfolio. Diegetically, these superheroes usually operate independently but occasionally assemble as a team to tackle especially formidable villains. This in contrast to certain other superhero teams such as the X-Men, whose characters were created specifically to be part of their team, with the team being central to their identity. The Avengers were created to create a new line of books to sell and to cross-promote Marvel Comics characters. An Iron Man fan might buy an Avengers book because Iron Man appears in them, and perhaps in turn take an interest in Thor, who appears in the same book as Iron Man's friend and comrade. The cast usually features a few highly popular characters who have their own solo books, such as Iron Man, alongside a number of lesser-known characters who benefit from exposure, such as Quicksilver.\nThe Avengers have appeared in a wide variety of media outside of comic books, including several different animated television series and direct-to-video films. Beginning in 2008, they were adapted in a film series from Marvel Studios, known as the Marvel Cinematic Universe, culminating with The Avengers in 2012, with more appearances of the team in subsequent films.\n\nPublication history\nThe team debuted in The Avengers #1 (September 1963).  Much like the Justice League, the Avengers were an assemblage of superheroes who each had an existing series of his own.  All of the characters were created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. This initial series, published bi-monthly through issue #6 (July 1964) and monthly thereafter ran through issue #402 (Sept. 1996), with spinoffs including several annuals, miniseries and a giant-size quarterly sister series that ran briefly in the mid-1970s.  Writers of the first series included Roy Thomas, Steve Englehart, Gerry Conway, Jim Shooter, David Michelinie and Roger Stern.  Artists included John Buscema, Tom Palmer, Neal Adams, George Perez, John Byrne and Steve Epting.\nOther spinoff series include West Coast Avengers, initially published as a four-issue miniseries in 1984, followed by a 102-issue series (Oct. 1985\u2013Jan. 1994), retitled Avengers West Coast with #47; and the 40-issue Solo Avengers (Dec.1987\u2013Jan. 1991), retitled Avengers Spotlight with #21.\nBetween 1996 and 2004, Marvel relaunched the primary Avengers title three times. In 1996, the \"Heroes Reborn\" line took place in an alternate universe, with a revamped history unrelated to mainstream Marvel continuity.\nThe Avengers vol. 3  ran for 84 issues from February 1998 to August 2004. Early issues were written by Kurt Busiek and pencilled by George Perez.  To coincide with what would have been the 500th issue of the original series, Marvel changed the numbering, and The Avengers #500\u2013503 (Sept.\u2013 Dec. 2004), the one-shot Avengers Finale (Jan. 2005) became the \"Avengers Disassembled\" storyline and final issues. In January 2005, a new version of the team appeared in the ongoing title The New Avengers, followed by The Mighty Avengers, Avengers: The Initiative, and Dark Avengers. Avengers vol. 4 debuted in July 2010 and ran until January 2013. Vol. 5 was launched in February 2013. After Secret Wars, a new Avengers team debuted, dubbed the All-New, All-Different Avengers, starting with a Free Comic Book Day preview. Following Civil War II, the book was relaunched in 2016 as Avengers, while retaining the same writer and much of the cast from the All-New, All-Different run. The series ran for 11 issues before reverting to the numbering of the original Avengers series with issue #672. Starting with issue #675, all four Avengers titles being published at the time (Avengers, Uncanny Avengers, U.S. Avengers and Occupy Avengers) were merged into a single weekly series dubbed Avengers: No Surrender, lasting 16 issues, designed to close out this era of the team's history.\nFollowing the conclusion of No Surrender in 2018, the series was relaunched again as Avengers.\n\nFictional history\n1960s\nWhen the Asgardian god Loki seeks revenge against his brother Thor, his machinations unwittingly lead teenager Rick Jones to collect Ant-Man (Hank Pym), the Wasp and Iron Man to help Thor and the Hulk, the latter of whom Loki used as a pawn. After the group vanquished Loki, Ant-Man stated that the five worked well together and suggested they form a team; the Wasp named the group Avengers.\nThe roster changed almost immediately; in the second issue (November 1963), Ant-Man became Giant-Man, and at the end of the issue, the Hulk left once he realized how much the others feared his unstable personality. Captain America joined the team in issue #4 (March 1964), and he was given \"founding member\" status in the Hulk's place. The Hulk, upset about being replaced by Captain America and the apparent betrayal by Rick, sought revenge against the Avengers, who teamed up with the Fantastic Four to stop him in The Fantastic Four #26 (May 1964). The Avengers went on to fight foes such as Baron Zemo, who formed the Masters of Evil, Kang the Conqueror, Wonder Man, and Count Nefaria.\nThe next milestone came when every member but Captain America resigned; they were replaced by three former villains: Hawkeye and the Maximoff twins, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver (Marvel Comics). Giant-Man, now calling himself Goliath, and the Wasp rejoined. Hercules became part of the team, while the Black Knight and the Black Widow abetted the Avengers but did not become members until years later. Spider-Man was offered membership but did not join the group. The Black Panther joined after rescuing the team from the Grim Reaper and Klaw. The X-Men #45 (June 1968) featured a crossover with The Avengers #53 (June 1968). This was followed by the introduction of the android Vision. Pym assumed the new identity of Yellowjacket in issue #59, and married the Wasp the following month.\nThe Avengers headquarters was in a New York City building called Avengers Mansion, courtesy of Tony Stark (Iron Man's real identity). The mansion was serviced by Edwin Jarvis, the Avengers' faithful butler, and furnished with state of the art technology and defense systems, and included the Avengers' primary mode of transport: the five-engine Quinjet.\nThe prequel comic Avengers #1 1\/2 (Dec. 1999), by writer Roger Stern and artist Bruce Timm, told a retro-style story taking place between issues #1 and #2, detailing Ant-Man's decision to transform himself into Giant-Man.\n\n1970s\nThe team encountered new characters such as Arkon in issue #75 (April 1970) and Red Wolf in #80 (Sept. 1970). The team's  adventures increased in scope as the team crossed into an alternate dimension and battled the Squadron Supreme, and fought in the Kree-Skrull War, an epic battle between the alien Kree and Skrull races and guest-starred the Kree hero, Captain Marvel. The Avengers briefly disband when Skrulls impersonating Captain America, Thor, and Iron Man used their authority as founders of the team and disbanded it. The true founding Avengers, minus the Wasp, reformed the team in response after complaints from Jarvis.\nMantis joined the team along with the reformed Swordsman. \"The Avengers-Defenders Clash\" storyline crossed over between the two team titles. \"The Celestial Madonna\" arc linked Mantis' origins to the very beginnings of the Kree-Skrull conflict in a time-spanning adventure involving Kang the Conqueror, and Immortus, who were past and future versions of each other. Mantis was revealed to be the Celestial Madonna, who was destined to give birth to a being that would save the universe. It was revealed that the Vision's body had only been appropriated, and not created by Ultron, and that it had belonged to the 1940s Human Torch. With his origins clear to him, the Vision proposed to the Scarlet Witch. The \"Celestial Madonna\" saga ended with their wedding, presided over by Immortus. The Beast and Moondragon joined the team soon after. A seven-part story featured the Squadron Supreme and the Serpent Crown.\nOther classic storylines included \"The Bride of Ultron\", the \"Nefaria Trilogy\", and \"The Korvac Saga\", which featured nearly every Avenger who joined the team up to that point. Henry Peter Gyrich became the Avengers' liaison to the United States National Security Council. Gyrich was prejudiced against superhumans and acted in a heavy-handed, obstructive manner, and insisted that the Avengers follow government rules and regulations or else lose their priority status with the government. Among Gyrich's demands was that the active roster be trimmed down to only seven members, and that the Falcon, an African American, be admitted to the team to comply with affirmative action laws. This last act was resented by Hawkeye, who because of the seven-member limit lost his membership slot to the Falcon. The Falcon, in turn, was unhappy to be the beneficiary of what he perceived to be tokenism, and decided to resign from the team, after which Wonder Man rejoined. The true origins of Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch were revealed in a three-part story that ran in issues #185\u2013187 (July\u2013Sept. 1979). After this adventure, the Scarlet Witch took a leave of absence and Ms. Marvel officially joined the team as her replacement.\n\n1980s\nThe first major development was the breakdown of Henry Pym, with his frequent changes of costume and name being symptomatic of an identity problem and an inferiority complex. After he abused his wife, failed to win back the confidence of the Avengers with a ruse and was duped by the villain Egghead, Pym was jailed. Pym would later outwit Egghead and defeated the latest incarnation of the Masters of Evil single-handedly, and proved his innocence. Pym reconciled with the Wasp, but they decided to remain apart. Pym retired from super-heroics, but returned years later.\nThis was followed by several major storylines, such as \"Ultimate Vision\" in which the Vision took over the world's computer systems in a misguided attempt to create world peace; the formation of the West Coast Avengers; and \"Avengers Under Siege\" which involved the second Baron Zemo and the Masters of Evil taking over the mansion and severely injuring Jarvis and Hercules. \"Assault on Olympus\" featured Hercules' father, Zeus, blaming the Avengers for his son's injuries and brought them to Olympus for trial, and the \"Heavy Metal\" arc saw the Super Adaptoid organized several robotic villains for an assault on the team. New members during the 1980s included Tigra; the She-Hulk; Monica Rambeau (then going by the name Captain Marvel); Starfox (the brother of Thanos); Hawkeye's wife, Mockingbird; and Namor, while Henry Pym emerged from retirement to join the West Coast Avengers. Spider-Man was again offered membership, but failed to gain admission due to security concerns by the Avengers' government liaison.\nThe villain Nebula falsely claimed to be the granddaughter of Thanos. The team relocated for a period to a floating island off the coast of New York called Hydrobase after Avengers Mansion was severely damaged during the events in \"Under Siege\". Hydrobase was later sunk during the Acts of Vengeance crossover.\nThe Avengers and West Coast Avengers changed to allow members to be active when available and reserved when not available and merged the two separate Avengers teams into one team with two bases. The Vision had his personality fundamentally altered, along with the discovery that the children of the Scarlet Witch and the Vision were actually illusions. The loss of the Scarlet Witch's children and the Vision, who was disassembled by government agents in retaliation for the Ultimate Vision storyline, drove her insane, although she eventually recovered and rejoined the team. This story revealed that the Scarlet Witch's powers included wide-range reality manipulation and she was what the time-traveling Immortus refers to as a \"nexus being\" setting the stage for 2004's eventual Chaos and Avengers Disassembled storylines. This played out in the Darker than Scarlet storyline which ran in Avengers West Coast from issues #51\u201362 (Nov. 1989\u2013Sept. 1990). The Avengers titles in late 1989 were involved in the major crossover event \"Acts of Vengeance\" where Loki assembled many of Marvel's arch-villains, his inner circle consisted of Doctor Doom, Magneto, Kingpin, Mandarin, Wizard, and Red Skull, in a plot to destroy the team. Loki orchestrated a mass breakout of villains from prison facility, the Vault, as part of his \"Acts of Vengeance\" scheme, but he ultimately failed in his goal to destroy the Avengers.\n\n1990s\nThe U.S. government revoked the Avengers' New York State charter in a treaty with the Soviet Union. The Avengers then received a charter from the United Nations and the Avengers split into two teams again with a substitute reserve team backing up the main teams.\nAt this point, ongoing storylines and character development focused on the Black Knight, Sersi, Crystal, Hercules, the Vision, and the Black Widow. Their primary antagonists in this run were the mysterious Proctor and his team of other-dimensional Avengers known as the Gatherers. During this period, the Avengers found themselves facing increasingly murderous enemies and were forced to question their rule against killing.\nThis culminated in \"Operation: Galactic Storm\", a 19-part storyline that ran through all Avengers-related titles and showcased a conflict between the Kree and the Shi'ar Empire. The team split when Iron Man and several dissidents executed the Supreme Intelligence against the wishes of Captain America. After a vote disbanded the West Coast Avengers, Iron Man formed a proactive and aggressive team called Force Works. During the team's first mission, Wonder Man was killed again, though his atoms were temporarily scattered. Force Works later disbanded after it was revealed that Iron Man became a murderer via the manipulations of the villain Kang, the same storyline seeing Iron Man sacrificing himself and being replaced by his teenage counterpart from a parallel timeline.\nDuring the Heroes Reborn event, many of the Avengers together with the Fantastic Four and others, died trying to stop the psychic entity Onslaught, although it was revealed that Franklin Richards preserved those heroes in a pocket universe. Believing the main team to be gone, the Black Widow disbanded the Avengers, and only butler Edwin Jarvis remained to tend to the Mansion.\nThe previous continuity of the Marvel Universe was set aside as the heroes were \"reborn\" in the pocket universe created by Franklin Richards to save his parents and their friends, while the \"Heroes Reborn\" line ended and the heroes returned to the prime Marvel Universe. This restoration also undid recent changes to the team members such as the Wasp being mutated into an insectoid state, Hawkeye being rendered deaf, and Stark being replaced by his teenage self, attributed to Franklin's childish perception recreating the heroes in the manner he was more familiar with.\nAfter the Heroes Reborn series concluded, the Avengers comic was restarted with vol. 3 #1 written by Kurt Busiek and pencilled by George P\u00e9rez.  New members during this run included the revived Wonder Man, Justice, Firestar, Silverclaw, and Triathlon. The Avengers fought many of their traditional villains such as the Grim Reaper, Ultron, Count Nefaria, and Kang the Conqueror. The limited series Avengers Forever, starting during this period, was a time travel story that explored the history of the Avengers and resolved many outstanding questions about Kang and Immortus's past manipulations of the team, featuring various Avengers from the past (Captain America immediately after \"Secret Empire\", Hank Pym early in his Yellowjacket delusion, and Hawkeye just after the Kree-Skrull war), present (Hank Pym as Giant-Man and Janet as the Wasp) and possible futures (Genis-Vell and Songbird) working alongside Kang the Conqueror and Rick Jones as part of Kang's attempt to escape his perceived 'destiny' as Immortus.\n\n2000s\nThe Avengers were granted international authority by the United Nations. Members joining during that period included Jack of Hearts and the second Ant-Man. A new Captain Britain was added to the team. The \"Avengers Disassembled\" storyline followed. Titled Chaos, the story featured the deaths of some members and a loss of credibility for the team. The culprit is revealed to be the Scarlet Witch, who had gone insane after agonizing over the memory of her lost children and who subsequently lost control of her reality-altering powers. With the team in disarray and Avengers Mansion ruined, the surviving members agreed to disband.\nA new Avengers team formed, in the series New Avengers after a group of heroes banded together to thwart a break-out at super-villain prison the Raft, composed of Iron Man, Captain America, Luke Cage, Wolverine, Ronin, Spider-Man, Spider-Woman, and the mysterious Sentry. This was soon followed by the House of M event.\nIn the company-wide \"Civil War\" story arc, Marvel superheroes were split over compliance with the U.S. government's new Superhuman Registration Act, which required all superpowered persons to register their true identities with the federal government and become agents of same. The New Avengers disbanded, with a rebel underground starring in a series retaining The New Avengers in its trademarked cover logo and New Avengers in its copyright indicia. Luke Cage led this team, consisting of himself, Echo, Ronin, Spider-Man, Spider-Woman, Wolverine, Iron Fist, and Doctor Strange. During the long-term Secret Invasion by the shape-shifting alien race the Skrulls, it was revealed that Spider-Woman had been abducted and replaced by the Skrull queen Veranke before she even joined the team. After the Skrulls' defeat, Spider-Woman was rescued along with other abducted and replaced heroes. During the company-wide story arc \"Dark Reign\", Echo and Iron Fist left the team and the Avengers gained Ms. Marvel, Bucky Barnes as a fill-in Captain America, and Mockingbird.\nIron Man, in the series The Mighty Avengers, formed a team under the aegis of the government's Fifty State Initiative program, and took up residency in New York City, joined by Ares, the Black Widow, the Sentry, the Wasp, Wonder Man, and leader Carol Danvers as Ms. Marvel. After the events of the Secret Invasion story arc, Norman Osborn assumed control of the formerly S.H.I.E.L.D.-sponsored Avengers, now under the auspices of his own agency, H.A.M.M.E.R. All but Ares and the Sentry left this team \u2014 the Wasp appeared to have died \u2014 and the team migrated to the series Dark Avengers. Osborn recruited Marvel Boy to pose as Captain Marvel and Daken to pose as his father, Wolverine, bringing Moonstone, Bullseye, and Venom from his previous Thunderbolts team to impersonate Ms. Marvel, Hawkeye, and Spider-Man respectively.\nIn The Mighty Avengers, Pym, assumed the Wasp identity in tribute to his fallen ex-wife, led a new team of Avengers, and claimed the name for his team as he was the only founding Avenger on any of the three active Avengers rosters (Wasp and Cap were dead, Thor was acting solo, and Iron Man was on the run from Osborn). His team operated under a multinational umbrella group, the Global Reaction Agency for Mysterious Paranormal Activity (GRAMPA). This team featured the roster of Hercules, Amadeus Cho, Stature, the Vision, Jocasta, U.S. Agent, Quicksilver, Magneto, and Pym. Loki in disguise as the Scarlet Witch was a recurring character. Iron Man and the Hulk were briefly with them.\n\n2010s\nAfter Osborn's Dark Avengers are exposed as criminals and their attack on Asgard was thwarted, the next iteration of the Avengers roster consists of Thor, Hawkeye, Spider-Man, Wolverine, Captain America, Spider-Woman, Iron Man, and team leader Maria Hill. Steve Rogers, briefly eschewing his Captain America persona, responds to Luke Cage's concerns about the team reverting to old methods by granting Cage's \"New Avengers\" recognition as an official team independent of Stark's more traditional Avengers. Bucky Barnes as Captain America joined the main Avengers, while Iron Fist, Power Woman, and the Thing joined Cage's team, Spider-Man and Wolverine maintaining dual membership in both teams. Rogers was an occasional presence and Victoria Hand was added as a government liaison for the New Avengers with Rogers's backing.\nA second series, titled Secret Avengers, was released in May 2010, written by Ed Brubaker with Mike Deodato as the regular artist. The second volume of the New Avengers series was launched in June 2010, written by Bendis and drawn by Stuart Immonen. A fourth title, Avengers Academy, was launched in June 2010, replacing Avengers: The Initiative. Christos Gage served as writer, with Mike McKone as artist.\nFollowing a meeting between Rogers and MI-13, Captain Britain accepts a position with the Avengers. Noh-Varr later does as well. Bruce Banner made arrangements with Rogers for the Red Hulk to join.\nThe \"Shattered Heroes\" storyline leads to several changes in the main Avengers lineup, with Quake and Storm being recruited, and the Vision rejoining the team. Wolverine and Spider-Man leave the main team and become more involved with the New Avengers. During the events of the \"Avengers vs. X-Men\" storyline, Storm quits to side with her fellow mutants as a member of the X-Men. The Avengers dismiss Noh-Varr after he attempted to betray the team, though ultimately he did not. The conflict ends with both teams united but defeated by an unrepentant Cyclops. A new series, Uncanny Avengers, debuted in the flagship title of the Marvel NOW! initiative. The title is written by Rick Remender with art by John Cassaday, and the team contains members of both the Avengers and the X-Men. As well, a biweekly Avengers title was launched, written by Jonathan Hickman and drawn by different artists for each story arc. Hickman also began writing New Avengers.\nDuring the 2014 \"AXIS\" storyline, when a now-evil Scarlet Witch invades Latveria, Doctor Doom forms his own team of Avengers consisting of 3D Man, Elsa Bloodstone, Stingray, Valkyrie, and U.S. Agent. After various heroes and villains experience a moral inversion in the battle against the Red Skull empowered with Professor Charles Xavier's abilities, Rogers later assembles Magneto, Doctor Doom, the Absorbing Man, Carnage, Deadpool, the Enchantress, the Hobgoblin, the fifth Jack O'Lantern, Loki, Mystique, and Sabretooth, all temporarily 'inverted' to act as heroes, to assist he and Spider-Man in defeating the inverted Avengers and X-Men until the original spell can be undone. During the \"Time Runs Out\" storyline, Sunspot created a team of the Avengers, consisting of himself, Black Widow, Cannonball, Manifold, Pod, Shang-Chi, Smasher, Spider-Woman, Validator, and the Children of the Sun. The \"Multiversal Avengers\" division of this team consists of Abyss, the Ex Nihili (including Ex Nihilo), Hyperion, Nightmask, Odinson, and Star Brand.\nFollowing the destruction and reconstruction of reality in the 2015 \"Secret Wars\" storyline, a new team is created known as Avengers Idea Mechanics, set to tackle Avengers-level threats beyond simply fighting villains, while the Avengers Unity Squad continues to operate to support mutant relations. Iron Man forms a new team of Avengers in the All-New All-Different Avengers series consisting of himself, the Vision, Nova, Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan), Spider-Man (Miles Morales), Captain America (Sam Wilson), and Thor (Jane Foster). Following the \"Civil War II\", storyline, the title was canceled and replaced with a new volume of the regular Avengers title. The roster was also changed, where following Iron Man being placed in a coma, and Spider-Man, Nova, and Ms. Marvel's resignation from the team (who instead teamed up with other heroes their own age to form their own group the Champions), the remaining three members are joined by Spider-Man (Peter Parker), Hercules and Wasp (Nadia Pym) to form a new team.\nDuring the 2017 \"Secret Empire\" storyline, when Captain America was 'reprogrammed' to believe that he had been a Hydra sleeper agent since childhood, the Hydra regime formed their own Avengers. This team consisted of Odinson (Thor currently doubting his worth and believing that Rogers must be 'right' as he could wield Mjolnir when Thor couldn't, unaware that Hydra had used the cosmic cube to change the nature of the enchantment), Deadpool, a Chthon-possessed Scarlet Witch, Vision (who was suffering from an A.I. Virus created by Arnim Zola), Taskmaster, Eric O'Grady's Life Model Decoy counterpart Black Ant, and Doctor Octopus' Superior Octopus appearance. However, in the final stand, Odinson rejects Rogers' authority and sides with his old allies, while the Vision's daughter purges him of the virus and Brother Voodoo exorcises Chthon from the Witch. Taskmaster and Black Ant free the imprisoned Champions in exchange for leniency, and the true version of Steve Rogers was restored, using Mjolnir against his counterpart.\nIn May 2018, another volume for the series was launched as part of Marvel's Fresh Start initiative, written by Jason Aaron and drawn by Ed McGuinness. This new volume also saw the return of the main three core members, as Steve Rogers and Thor met up with Tony Stark to convince him to reassemble the group with themselves at its core. The reunion was consolidated by the machinations of Loki, who facilitated the arrival of the world-threatening Dark Celestials as a ploy to get the Avengers back in action, resulting in the participation of Black Panther, Captain Marvel, She-Hulk, Ghost Rider and Blade, with the Black Panther being elected chairperson. After the Dark Celestials were defeated, the Celestials set upright the corpse of the long-time dead Progenitor in the North Pole. The Avengers refurbished the Progenitor's corpse, transforming it into their base of operations, the Avengers Mountain.\n\n2020s\nTeam roster\nThe Avengers team lineup is known for being perpetually fluid and changing, with many members coming and going, often more than once. The founding members of the team were Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Ant-Man and the Wasp. Hulk left after a single issue, which would become a running gag among splinter team members (for example, Spider-Man leaving the second incarnation of the Avengers Unity Division), and his founder status was retroactively filled in by Captain America. Later additions and frequent members include Hawkeye, Wonder Man, Falcon, Black Panther, Captain Marvel, Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver, and Vision, among others.\nThere are also numerous splinter teams that have formed, starting with the West Coast Avengers in 1984. Each of these splinter teams tends to specialize in a way the main team does not. Members of these teams can be on other splinter teams or on the main team. These teams are, in alphabetical order:\n\nA-Force: An all-female team formed after the Secret Wars event.\nAvengers A.I.: A team consisting of people with various artificial intelligence-related abilities.\nAvengers Academy: A school for teenage superheroes who served as Avengers members and received training from full-time Avengers members. The school was shut down shortly after the events of Avengers Arena.\nAvengers Unity Division: A team meant to bridge the gap between humans, mutates, and mutants following Avengers vs. X-Men by including members of all groups. Their mission statement was later expanded to include Inhumans.\nAvengers World: A team that specializes in international protection following the disbandment of the U.S.Avengers; not to be confused with the comic book of the same name.\nGreat Lakes Avengers: A farcical team consisting of low-level heroes living in Wisconsin.\nMighty Avengers:\nA team formed by Iron Man as part of the Fifty-States Initiative, which was broken apart after the events of Secret Invasion.\nA team formed by Hank Pym after the previous Mighty Avengers collapsed.\nA team formed by Luke Cage to deal with more street-level threats in response to the latest invasion by Thanos. It was shut down by Iron Man during the AXIS event.\nNew Avengers:\nA team created after the disbandment of the main team to replace them. This team was known for including more prestigious Marvel superheroes, such as Spider-Man, Wolverine, and Daredevil, and disbanded after the retirement of its leader, Luke Cage.\nA team formed by Sunspot after he purchased and reformed Advanced Idea Mechanics.\nA similar team to Sunspot's, going by the name \"Avengers Idea Mechanics\".\nSavage Avengers: A team consisting of supernatural and\/or antiheroic members.\nSecret Avengers:\nA black operation team formed by Steve Rogers.\nAnother undercover team formed by S.H.I.E.L.D.\nU.S.Avengers: A patriotic-themed team.\nWar Avengers: A temporary team formed during The War of the Realms event.\nWest Coast Avengers: A team formed by Vision to expand the Avengers' reach.\nYoung Avengers: A team consisting of teenage and young adult heroes.\nOf these teams, only the main team, Avengers World, the Great Lakes Avengers, the Savage Avengers, and the Young Avengers are currently active. Additionally, all members of the Fantastic Four, as well as various members of the X-Men, Heroes for Hire, and other prominent Marvel teams have served as members of the Avengers.\n\nEnemies\nThe Avengers have a long list of villains they frequently face.\nSome of the most recurring include Ultron, Kang the Conqueror, Loki and Thanos.\n\nCultural impact and legacy\nCritical response\nAbraham Josephine Riesman of Vulture included the Avengers team in their \"12 Teams That Defined Superhero Storytelling\" list. Michael Doran of Newsarama ranked the Avengers team 1st in their \"Best Superhero Teams of All Time\" list. Comic Book Resources asserted, \"The Avengers are known as Earth's mightiest heroes, and that appellation is self-explanatory. The team combines Marvel's greatest heroes into one powerful unit, an assemblage of heroes that faces down the deadliest threats the Marvel Universe can throw at them. The team has proven to be one of the most potent groups in all of comics, boasting legendary heroes and battling in titanic wars for the fate of all reality,\" and ranked the Avengers team 1st in their \"10 Most Important Marvel Hero Teams\" list, 1st in their \"Every Marvel Superhero Team\" list, 1st in their \"Marvel: The 10 Strongest Superhero Teams\" list, and 2nd in their \"Marvel: 10 Most Powerful Teams\" list.\nPoushali Guharauth of Sportskeeda ranked the Avengers 1st in their \"10 Best Superhero Teams of All Time\" list. Jason Serafino of Complex ranked the Avengers 2nd in their \"10 Best Superhero Teams In Comics\" list. Chris Isaac of Screen Rant the Avengers team 2nd in their \"15 Best Superhero Teams Of All Time\" list. Geoff Boucher of Deadline ranked the Avengers team 3rd in their \"Stan Lee's Legacy: Ranking The Hollywood Heroes Co-Created By The Marvel Comics Icon\" list.\n\nImpact\nMost of the characters that appear in Marvel Comics' books are set in the same fictional universe, known as the Marvel Universe. They occasionally make guest appearances in each other's books, and more regularly in team books, such as The Avengers. Such crossovers encouraged readers to buy other books in the Marvel Comics catalogue, and readers became engrossed not just in the individual characters but in their web of relationships across the broader setting. DC Comics pioneered this idea with the Justice Society of America and the Justice League, likewise promoting and developing the DC Universe. Many readers devoted themselves to just one of these two comic book universes. After all, they were both quite large and didn't overlap. Thus, the superhero fan community developed sub-communities of DC devotees and Marvel devotees.\n\nMarvel Cinematic Universe\nMarvel Studios repeated this business strategy when it produced the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), culminating with the release of The Avengers in 2012. Before the MCU, superhero movies were usually isolated productions mostly because of licensing issues, but the shared universe model has led to its continued growing success. In response, Warner Brothers (which owns DC Comics) began to produce its own series of interconnected superhero movies known as the DC Extended Universe (DCEU), culminating with Justice League in 2017. Movies tend to have bigger audiences than comic books, so, the general public are more aware that the likes of Wonder Woman and Captain America existed in separate universes owned by different companies. The movies raised brand awareness of DC Comics and Marvel Comics.\nAs of June 2022, the MCU is the highest-grossing film franchise in history, having collectively grossed over $26 billion in box-office revenue, more than twice that by the second largest franchise, Star Wars.\n\nTheme park attractions\nAvengers Campus\nAfter the acquisition by Disney in 2009, Marvel films began to be marketed at the Innoventions attraction in Tomorrowland at Disneyland. For Iron Man 3, the exhibit, entitled \"Iron Man Tech Presented by Stark Industries\", featured the same armor display that was shown at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con, with the Marks I-VII and the new Mark XLII. In addition, there was a simulator game, titled \"Become Iron Man\", that used Kinect-like technology to allow the viewer to be encased in an animated Mark XLII armor and take part in a series of \"tests,\" in which you fire repulsor rays and fly through Tony Stark's workshop. The game was guided by J.A.R.V.I.S., who is voiced again by Paul Bettany. The exhibit also had smaller displays that included helmets and chest pieces from the earlier films and the gauntlet and boot from an action sequence in Iron Man 3. The exhibit for Thor: The Dark World was called \"Thor: Treasures of Asgard\", and featured displays of Asgardian relics and transports guests to Odin's throne room, where they were greeted by Thor. Captain America: The Winter Soldier's exhibit, \"Captain America: The Living Legend and Symbol of Courage\", featured a meet and greet experience.\nFrom May to September 2017, Disneyland Resort featured the \"Summer of Heroes\", which sees members of the Guardians and Avengers making appearances throughout the Disneyland Resort. Additionally, the Guardians of the Galaxy: Awesome Dance Off event was featured, which involved Peter Quill \/ Star-Lord blasting music from his boombox, along with the Avengers Training Initiative, a limited experience where Black Widow and Hawkeye \"assemble a group of young recruits to see if they have what it takes to be an Avenger.\" Marvel-related food and merchandise was also available throughout Hollywood Land at Disney California Adventure during the \"Summer of Heroes\".\nIn March 2018, the Walt Disney Company announced three new Marvel-themed areas inspired by the MCU to Disney California Adventure, Walt Disney Studios Paris, and Hong Kong Disneyland. The developments will be designed by Walt Disney Imagineering in collaboration with Marvel Studios and Marvel Themed Entertainment. As was established with Guardians of the Galaxy \u2013 Mission: Breakout!, Avengers Campus exists in its own theme park universe that is inspired by the MCU. Being in the MCU multiverse, Avengers Campus has a shared history with the MCU proper, with a few notable exceptions being the Blip from Avengers: Infinity War did not occur, and some characters who died, such as Tony Stark, are still alive.\n\nWalt Disney Studios Park\nIn March 2018, the Walt Disney Company announced a new Marvel-themed area inspired by the MCU to Disneyland Paris' Walt Disney Studios Park. The area includes a reimagined attraction where riders team up with Iron Man and other Avengers on a \"hyper-kinetic adventure\" on July 20, 2022.

The Las Vegas version of the exhibit featured updated character details and corresponding science to incorporate the Marvel films that have released since the original exhibit in New York. Additionally, the Las Vegas version features Cobie Smulders reprising her role as Maria Hill to \"debrief\" visitors, replacing Welliver.\n\nAvengers: Damage Control\nIn October 2019, Marvel Studios and ILMxLAB announced the virtual reality experience Avengers: Damage Control. The experience would be available for a limited time starting in mid-October 2019 at select Void VR locations.

The experience was extended to the end of 2019.\n\nOther versions\n1950s Avengers\nA short-lived team of superheroes in the 1950s called themselves the Avengers. It consisted of Marvel Boy, Venus, the 3-D Man, Gorilla-Man, M-11, Jimmy Woo, Namora, and Jann of the Jungle, and existed in an alternate timeline that was erased by the time-manipulating Immortus. Agents of Atlas, a version of the group, without 3-D Man and Jann existed in mainstream continuity, and eventually reformed in the present day.\n\nAge of Apocalypse\nA humanized version of the Avengers banded together during the Age of Apocalypse and were known as the Human High Council.\n\nAvengers 1959\nThe New Avengers vol. 2, #10 revealed another 1950s Avengers team, formed by Nick Fury to hunt the last remnants of Nazi Germany and consisted of Fury himself, Dominic Fortune, Dum Dum Dugan, Namora, Silver Sable, Sabretooth, Kraven the Hunter, and Ulysses Bloodstone. A follow-up miniseries penned by Howard Chaykin showed this group assisted by Blonde Phantom, Eric Koenig and a brand new character British wizard and spy, Powell McTeague. That time they fought against a cult based on the Nazi party which employed several agents, including Baron Blood and Brain Drain.\n\nAvengers (1,000,000 B.C. version)\nIn the one-shot issue that ties in with \"Marvel Legacy\", there was a version of the Avengers that existed back circa 1,000,000 B.C. The line-up consists of Agamotto, Odin, Lady Phoenix and Stone Age versions of Black Panther, Ghost Rider, Iron Fist, and Star Brand. This group first came together to defeat an out-of-control Celestial called the Fallen where they defeated it and sealed it underground somewhere in South Africa.\n\nAvengers (1000 A.D. version)\nDuring the 11th century, it is revealed that Thor had formed that time period's version of the Avengers with Boldof the Black, the Black Panther Nehanda, Chief Hellhawk, the Atlantean Gale who wielded the Iron Fist, and Tanaraq of the Great Beasts.\n\nAvengers Forever\nOne of the timelines seen in Avengers Forever is an alternate future where Martians have ravaged Earth and killed most of its heroes. An older version of Black Panther leads a team of Avengers consisting of Killraven, Living Lightning, Jocasta, a new Crimson Dynamo, and Thundra.\n\nAvengers Next\nIn the alternate future timeline known as MC2, the Avengers disbanded and Avengers Mansion was a museum. An emergency forced Edwin Jarvis to sound an alert, and a new generation of heroes formed a new team of Avengers. Most of the new Avengers were children of established Marvel superheroes.\n\nHouse of M: Avengers\nIn an alternate reality which was created by the Scarlet Witch, the Avengers were a street gang of superpowered humans formed by Luke Cage in Hell's Kitchen, a human ghetto in the mutant-ruled reality. Although they were initially criminals, the disenfranchised human residents came to view the Avengers as their protectors and would often go to Cage when the mutant authorities refused to help them.\n\nMarvel 2099\nIn Marvel 2099, the Avengers were mentioned in this timeline where it was mentioned that Captain America, Thor, Iron Man, and Hulk were known members.\nOn the unified reality of Earth-2099, there was a group of Avengers that consisted of Black Widow, Black Widow 2098, Cable, Captain America, Daredevil (Samuel Fisk), Frankenstein's Monster, a 2099 version of Grey Hulk, Iron Man, Moon Knight, Phastos, Relur, Roman the Sub-Mariner, Strange, and Thor. When Doom 2099 brought an end of the Heroic Age, it had affected the Avengers in different ways. Black Widow 2098, Daredevil, Frankenstein's Monster, Grey Hulk, Phastos, Relur, Roman the Sub-Mariner, and Strange were killed by the 2099 version of Masters of Evil. Cable and Moon Knight survived with the latter forming the 2099 version of the New Avengers who successfully avenged the fallen Avengers by defeating the Masters of Evil and having them remanded to a prison on the planet Wakanda.\n\nMarvel Zombies\nThe Avengers existed as a team prior to a zombie contagion's arrival in the original Marvel Zombies universe and resembled their pre-disassembled roster. When several of their members were infected, they set about eating humanity and sent out a bogus \"Avengers Assemble\" call to draw super-humans to the Avengers Mansion, infected more heroes and thus spread the virus. The team fell apart and many of its members were killed as time passed.\nThe second team of zombie Avengers appeared in Marvel Zombies Return, set in another timeline where the original zombies had been sent after the final battle. That team was brought together to find food and kill any resistance (zombie or uninfected) and was led by Sentry. Also on the team were the zombies Moon Knight, Namor, Quasar, Quicksilver, Thundra, and Super-Skrull. They were joined by zombie Giant-Man of the original Zombiverse, who was trying to power a dimensional teleporter, but were all killed by Spider-Man's New Avengers. The team was composed of himself with Iron Man (James Rhodes, who had escaped infection by the zombie virus by amputating his bitten limbs and replacing them with cybernetic implants), Sandman, and the zombie Hulk and Wolverine.\n\nSecret Wars\nDuring the \"Secret Wars\" storyline, the different domains of Battleworld have different versions of the Avengers:\n\nIn the Battleworld domain of Spider-Island, the Avengers were taken over by the same spider-virus turning them into Man-Spiders that obeyed the Spider-Queen's every command. It took a combination of Man-Wolf's gemstone, Morbius the Living Vampire's serum, the Lizard serum, and the Goblin formula to free some of the Avengers. After the Spider-Queen was defeated, Spider-Island is now a domain filled with Man-Spiders, Dinosaur People, Lizard People, Bird People, Vampires, and Werewolves.\nIn the Battleworld domain of the Regency, Hawkeye has kept the Avengers alive in S.H.I.E.L.D. after most of its members and other known superheroes were defeated by Regent.\nIn the Battleworld domain of Marville, the Avengers are children and consist of Captain America, Black Widow, Captain marvel, Falcon, Hawkeye, Hulk, Iron Man, Nick Fury, Scarlet Witch, She-Hulk, Spider-Man, Thor, Vision, and War Machine.\nIn the Battleworld domain of the Kingdom of Manhattan, elements of Earth-616 and Earth-1610 helped to make this domain which caused a new reality that is a fusion of both with characters from both realities co-existing. The Avengers consisted of Captain America (Sam Wilson), Captain America (Steve Rogers), Black Widow, Hawkeye, Hulk's Doc Green form, Iron Man, Ms. Marvel, Spider-Man, Thor, War Machine, Wasp, Wonder Man, and the Unity Division (Rogue, Quicksilver, Sabretooth, Scarlet Witch, and Vision) while the Ultimates consisted of Ben Grimm, Captain America, Hawkeye, Human Torch, Invisible Woman, Iron Man, and Thor.\nIn the Battleworld domain of the City, the Holy Wood section of it has its version of the Avengers led by Baron Simon Williams and consists of Black Panther, Black Widow, Captain Marvel, Hercules, Jocasta, Moondragon, Vision, and Yellowjacket.\nIn the Battleworld domain of 2099, the Avengers are a team of corporate superheroes sponsored by Alchemax. The group consists of Captain America (a Latina woman named Roberta Mendez), Black Widow (an African-American woman named Tania), Iron Man (a dwarf named Sonny Frisco), Hawkeye (a human\/hawk hybrid named Max), and Hercules.\nIn the Battleworld domain of the Walled City of New York, the Avengers are allied with S.H.I.E.L.D.'s part of the domain and consist of Captain America, Hulk, Iron Man, Rage, Scarlet Witch, She-Hulk, Spider-Man, and Thor.\n\nUltimate Marvel\nIn the Ultimate Marvel Universe, the Avengers are named the Ultimates, and were formed by General Nicholas Fury to protect America against superhuman threats. They first appeared in The Ultimates by Mark Millar and Bryan Hitch. After the events of The Ultimates 2, the team left S.H.I.E.L.D. employment to become independent and financed by Tony Stark.\nA Black Ops team called the Avengers debuted sometime after the Ultimatum storyline. This version was a project headed up by Nick Fury and Tony Stark's brother Gregory Stark to bring Captain America back. Its known members consisted of War Machine, Hawkeye, Black Widow II, Spider (an Asian in an orange and purple Spider-Man outfit who once claimed to be a spliced clone of Spider-Man and Professor X from the future), Tyrone Cash (who was the original Hulk before Bruce Banner), Red Wasp (a former Liberators member), and Nerd Hulk (an intelligent clone of Hulk who lacks Hulk's rage). Additional members included Punisher (who joined the Avengers against a Ghost Rider manhunt) and the half vampire Blade (who joined the group to help against a vampire invasion).\n\nIn other media\nTelevision\nThree animated series have been based on the team.\n\nThe Avengers: United They Stand was mainly based on the Roy Thomas era of the group, and ran from 1999 to 2000.\nThe Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes was based on the early adventures of the team, but also used many elements from other runs. The TV show ran for two seasons, from 2010 to 2012, and started presenting the original Avengers line-up founded by Iron Man, Thor, Ant-Man, Wasp and the Hulk, who leaves the group after battling Amora the Enchantress and Skurge. Captain America later joins the team, replacing him.\nAvengers Assemble is mainly based on the MCU iteration of the group and premiered on May 26, 2013. The show also changed its title to Avengers: Ultron Revolution (2016), Avengers: Secret Wars (2017) and Avengers: Black Panther's Quest (2018).\nThe Avengers appear in the Disney Junior series Spidey and His Amazing Friends.\n\nFilm\nMarvel Animation has made three Avengers films, Ultimate Avengers, Ultimate Avengers 2, and Next Avengers.\n\nMarvel Cinematic Universe\nThe Avengers are prominent in current popular culture due to the Marvel Cinematic Universe from Marvel Studios.\n\nSee also\nDark Avengers \u2013 Supervillain and antihero version of the Avengers\nYoung Avengers \u2013 Young version of the Avengers\nAlpha Flight \u2013 The Canadian version of the Avengers.\nBig Hero 6 \u2013 The Japanese version of the Avengers.\nExcalibur \u2013 The British version of the Avengers.\nWinter Guard \u2013 The Russian version of the Avengers.\nJustice League - A DC Comics superhero team with the same concept of the Avengers.\nList of Marvel Comics superhero debuts\n\nReferences\nSources\nAndrew Hickey (2011).

The program consists of two segments: Birdman, depicting the adventures of a winged superhero (created by Alex Toth, creator of Space Ghost) powered by the sun, and The Galaxy Trio, centered around the adventures of a patrol of interstellar superheroes. Each segment was a complete independent story, and the characters of each segment did not interact with those of the other, except for a bumper that has all four heroes defeating a prehistoric monster.\nA parody series, Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law, premiered on Adult Swim on September 2, 2001, concluding on July 22, 2007 after four seasons, with a special, Harvey Birdman: Attorney General, premiering on October 15, 2018, and a spin-off series, Birdgirl, premiering on April 5, 2021.\n\nSegments\nBirdman\nBirdman (voiced by Keith Andes) is an ordinary human who has been endowed by the sun god Ra with the ability to shoot solar rays from his fists and project quasi-solid \"solar shields\" to defend himself against attacks (Birdman's origin is only vaguely, and only briefly, hinted at during the series. His real name is there given as Raymond \"Ray\" Randall). After he had acquired his avian\u2014and other\u2014powers, he was recruited by a top-secret government agency, Inter-Nation Security, and now works full-time fighting crime, assisted by his pet eagle, who responds to the name of Avenger. In addition to the abilities he received from Ra, Birdman also possesses the power of flight, thanks to the giant wings which sprout from his back. It is possible Birdman is fireproof; being forced into an incinerator recharged rather than hurt him. His sole weakness is that he has to recharge his superhuman powers periodically, through exposure either to the sun's rays or to a comparable source of heat and\/or light such as a desk lamp (when he was once shrunken to insect proportions) or the aforementioned incinerator, a weakness that is exposed in nearly every episode. His trademark is his battle cry of \"Biiiiirdman!!!\" whenever he goes into battle.\nHe is assisted by his supporting characters:\n\nFalcon 7 (voiced by Don Messick) \u2013 Birdman's eye patch-wearing contact with Inter-Nation Security, and the person from whom Birdman typically receives his missions.\nBirdboy (voiced by Dick Beals) \u2013 A sidekick for Birdman. The two first met when Birdman happened upon a shipwreck, of which Birdboy was the only apparent survivor. Since the boy was near death from exposure, Birdman transferred some of his own super energy to him, reviving him and giving powers similar to Birdman's, and he went on to aid him in several episodes. Birdboy lacks the natural feathered wings sported by Birdman, however, and is only able to fly with the assistance of the mechanical wings strapped to his back. He spends much of his time searching for his father, who was lost in the wreck, but this is never resolved.\nGeneral Stone (voiced by Don Messick) \u2013 General Stone appears several times in Birdman with other military leaders, and tends to find himself on the receiving end of the villains' schemes.\nBirdman has fought the sinister organization F.E.A.R. that is led by Number One (voiced by John Stephenson) and Birdman's \"number one\" enemy. F.E.A.R. is behind many plots over the course of the series, frequently employing supervillains to perform nefarious tasks. The organization was seemingly defeated for good and its leader arrested in \"The Wings of F.E.A.R.\", but it occasionally resurfaced without any explanation.\nBirdman has also fought some other villains with some of them appearing either having one appearance or having more than one appearance. They consist of:\n\nDr. Millennium (voiced by Hal Smith) - A supervillain who appeared in \"The Menace of Dr. Millennium\", using a time-manipulating machine to commit crimes. He returned in \"The Revenge of Dr. Millennium\" where he tried to exact his revenge on Birdman and take over the world from the past.\nX the Eliminator (voiced by John Stephenson) - A mercenary hired by F.E.A.R. to eliminate Birdman. He is charged with bringing back Birdman's crest from his helmet as proof of his accomplishment.\nThe Ruthless Ringmaster (voiced by Vic Perrin) - An agent of F.E.A.R.\nMorto the Marauder (voiced by Vic Perrin) - A criminal genius and evidently once a significant threat to the world, Morto twice escaped from prison with his mechanical know-how and wreaked havoc in \"Morto the Marauder\" and \"Morto Rides Again\".\nCumulus the Storm King (voiced by Henry Corden) - A supervillain who can control the weather.\nNitron the Human Bomb (voiced by Barney Phillips) - A scientist who got the capabilities and powers of a chemical called NITRON. He is eager to join F.E.A.R, for which Number One tells him to finish the atomic reactor USS-CO-BOLT and Birdman, but fails.\nThe Mummer - A supervillain who is a master of disguise. Unlike most of Birdman's enemies, the Mummer was able to escape from him thanks to his disguises making him one of a few villains to get away.\nKiroff - A supervillain who was responsible for causing worldwide earthquakes.\nZardo - A supervillain who at one time captured Avenger. He received a complete redesign in Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law.\nThe Constrictor - Dressed like a snake and has two boa constrictors as his pets, this supervillain captures Avenger and tries to use him in order to capture Birdman. Birdman finds Avenger and burns Constrictor's headquarters down. Constrictor realizes Birdman is too powerful to be defeated and manages to escape, Birdman never caught the Constrictor making him one of a few villains to get away.\nReducto (voiced by John Stephenson): A supervillain who wields a shrink ray. He uses this ray to demand money from Central City or he will shrink it. After being defeated by Birdman, he is shrunken down to microscopic size.\nDoctor Shark - A supervillain who fought Birdman underwater and had the face of a shark, but the body of a man. Birdman had to constantly regain his strength by battling Doctor Shark in small increments so that he did not lose his energy from being away from the sun. Doctor Shark was eventually defeated.\nHannibal the Hunter - A big game hunter who is determined to hunt down Birdman.\nMentor the Mind-Taker (voiced by Don Messick) - Mentor has the ability to send cerebral messages to a person or animal to do his bidding. He uses this ability to get Birdman to steal missiles from the United States government. He plans on using these missiles to start a war between two countries. He was renamed Mentok when he appeared in Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law. The name change was also carried over to the Hanna-Barbera Beyond comics.\nDr. Freezoid - Dr. Freezoid has a weapon that can turn an entire city block into ice. He has a retreat at the North Pole. Birdman causes him to self-destruct his base of operations with his own weapons trapping Dr. Freezoid inside.\nThe Duplicator (voiced by Frank Gerstle) - An old man with large glasses, the Deadly Duplicator uses his glasses to create duplicates of the people that he zaps. The Deadly Duplicator has full control over the twin and uses them to help him in his plans to take over the world, but of course is thwarted by Birdman.\nProfessor Nightshade (voiced by Henry Corden) - An agent of F.E.A.R., he steals a solar box that has the power to send entire cities into the fourth dimension. Professor Nightshade traps Birdman and tries to use the solar box on him, but it reacts to Birdman differently: instead of sending Birdman into the fourth dimension, it gives him energy to become strong. When Prof. Nightshade tries to use it again on him, it reflects off of Birdman and Nightshade accidentally sends himself into the fourth dimension. Birdman then destroys the machine.\nThe Chameleon - A scientist who created a transformation serum that gave him the ability to shapeshift into whatever he wants, whether it's people, animals, or even inanimate objects. In the end, the serum in his body ran out and Birdman handed him over the police.\nCaptain Moray of the Deep - Captain Moray abducts his seventh scientist. He forces them to develop a nuclear reactor. Birdman disguises himself as a scientist and gets abducted by Moray, but Moray knew it was him and a great battle ensues. Birdman is then captured for real. He sends a signal to Birdboy to find him. As Birdman is about to enter a nuclear reactor (which should have killed him), his energy is instead restored enabling him to end the villainy of Captain Moray as Birdman hands him over to the Navy.\nThe Aliens of the Purple Moss - These were aliens who came to Earth to take it over. Fortunately, Birdman was informed and stopped the aliens in a heated battle.\nThe Brain Thief (voiced by Don Messick) - A mad scientist named Doctor Shado captures four other scientists and tries to steal the information in their minds.\nDr. Mentaur - A scientist who turned a woman into Birdgirl through hypnosis, a super serum, and some metal wings. Eventually, he was defeated and Birdgirl became normal again.\nBirdgirl - Created by Dr. Mentaur through hypnosis, a super serum and some metal wings. She was an aerialist before she met Dr. Mentaur. While under hypnosis, she was used to defeat Birdman. While captured, Birdman tricked her into letting him go outside as a last request. Regaining his strength from the sun, this allowed Birdman to defeat Dr. Mentaur and save Birdgirl.\nThe Magnatroid - This was a robot created by a scientist to destroy Birdman.\nMedusa (voiced by June Foray) a.k.a. \"the Empress of Evil\" - Medusa captures the Prince of the Maja Raja and then captures Birdman. The Prince gives Birdman a diamond from his turban that he says came from the sun god, Ra. After giving it to Birdman, Birdman is able to regain his strength and defeat Medusa. She throws herself into a pit of demons to elude him.\nSpyro - Head of a master spy syndicate, he hijacked the atomic city supply train to do some evil bidding.\nDr. Claw - A scientist that used an ant serum to inject into his creation, the Ant Ape. When he injects his robot creation, the Ant Ape becomes super-strong and nearly unstoppable, but Birdman defeats them.\nThe Speed Demon - A convicted felon already put away by Birdman retaliates by creating a potion that gives him super-speed. He runs around stealing money and jewels from various places. He then realizes that with his new power, he cannot be defeated. Speed Demon captures Birdman and almost defeats him, but Birman comes out on top. In the end, Speed Demon's speed causes his aging process to speed up rapidly while evading a missile and he becomes an old man, losing the battle.\nVulturo (voiced by Vic Perrin) - Dr. Vult is an evil scientist who made a vulture-like costume to combat Birdman. He first appeared in \"Vulturo, Prince of Darkness\" where he was hired by F.E.A.R. to destroy Birdman. In \"The Return of Vulturo\", Vulturo tried to exact his revenge that involved kidnapping Birdboy.\nThe Barracuda - A supervillain who plans on using torpedoes and submarines to loot ships and to start wars between countries.\nMurro (sic) the Marauder: (voiced by Hal Smith) This evil villain can commandeer the shadows of unsuspecting victims.

They maintain order and fight evildoers in the name of the Galactic Patrol law enforcement agency. The ship was equipped with a \"displacer\", that is, a teleportation device.\n\nVapor Man (voiced by Don Messick) \u2013 He has the ability to transform part or all of his body into gaseous form (a power shared by at least some residents of his home planet of Vaporus), enabling him to fly, escape from physical bonds, and squeeze through very small spaces, as well as producing various forms of \"vapor\" (such as \"freeze vapor\") from his hands.\nMeteor Man (voiced by Ted Cassidy) \u2013 A native of the planet Meteorus. Meteor Man is distinguished by his ability to increase or decrease the size of any part of his body.

Archived from the original on July 31, 2016.","39":"The first season of the American Western television series Bonanza premiered on NBC on September 12, 1959, with the final episode airing April 30, 1960. The series was developed and produced by David Dortort, and season one starred Lorne Greene, Pernell Roberts, Dan Blocker, and Michael Landon.  The season consisted of 32 episodes of the series's total 431 hour-long episodes, the entirety of which was produced in color. It aired on Saturdays from 7:30 pm\u20138:30 pm on NBC and placed at number 45 in the Nielsen ratings.\n\nSynopsis\nBonanza is set around the Ponderosa Ranch near Virginia City, Nevada and chronicles the weekly adventures of the Cartwright family, consisting of Ben Cartwright and his three sons (each by a different wife), Adam, Eric (\"Hoss\"), and Joseph (\"Little Joe\"). A regular character is their ranch cook, Hop Sing.\n\nCast and characters\nMain cast\nLorne Greene as Ben Cartwright\nPernell Roberts as Adam Cartwright\nDan Blocker as Eric \"Hoss\" Cartwright\nMichael Landon as Joseph \"Little Joe\" Cartwright\n\nRecurring\nVictor Sen Yung as Hop Sing\n\nGuest stars\nProduction\nDevelopment\nBy 1959, RCA had made progress in producing color television, but American consumers were not adopting the new technology. As the owner of NBC, they sought to produce a pioneer color program.  David Dortort created the concept as an hour-long show.  It was the first Western to be released in color.\nSeason one, episode 26, \"The Avenger\", was the pilot for an unsold spinoff.\n\nCasting\nThe character of Hoss was the first to be cast, then Little Joe, with Michael Landon being chosen to appeal to the teenage audience.  Dortort had worked with both of the actors in The Restless Gun.  After seeing Lorne Greene on an episode of Wagon Train, Dortort chose him for the role of Ben Cartwright, having felt Greene had the qualities he was seeking for the family patriarch.  Originally, Dortort wanted Guy Williams for the role of Adam, but he was already committed to Disney's Zorro at the time, so Pernell Roberts was cast instead.\nNBC originally wanted guest stars, but the costs of filming the show in color cut into the budget significantly.  Instead, Dortort would select a guest cast of unknowns.\n\nWriting\nDortort had input on most of the script writing.  He was credited with four of the scripts in the first season.\n\nProduction design\nSets were designed by Hal Pereira, Earl Hedrick, and David Dortort.  Set decoration was handled by Grace Gregory.\n\nFilming\nDortort originally planned to shoot on location, but film costs related to color production also cut into the budget for filming, resulting in the compromise of filming annually in the Sierra Nevada mountains.  Most of the filming was done at Paramount Studios.\nOther filming locations included:\n\nLos Angeles and surrounding areas (episode 1)\nIverson Movie Ranch (episodes 2, 4)\nBig Bear, California (episodes 3, 11, 15)\nBronson Canyon (episode 7)\n\nMusic\nJay Livingston and Ray Evans wrote the original theme song.  It was originally planned that the leads would sing the lyrics while riding out of Virginia City, but ultimately, the song was used instrumentally.  Dortort, not liking the lyrics, agreed to use the song under the provision that it would not be used within the episodes.  Dortort selected composer David Rose to write the music for the show, who scored the show's music with a 35 member orchestra.\n\nThemes\nThe show focused more on relationships than gun fights.  It also tackled social issues.  \"The Fear Merchants\" addressed bigotry against Chinese immigrants.\nOccasionally, scripts would be based on true events, albeit loosely, as often the historical events would not have taken place in the time period of the show.  \"The Paiute War\" was based on the Paiute War that occurred in May and June 1860. \"The Julia Bulette Story\" was based on the murder of Julia Bulette, which occurred in 1867 in Virginia City.  \"The Saga of Annie O'Toole\" was based on true events.  \"The Philip Deidesheimer Story\" tells the story of Philip Deidesheimer's work developing square-set mining in the Comstock Lode's Ophir Mine in Virginia City in 1860.\n\nEpisodes\nRelease\nThe season aired on Saturdays from 7:30 pm\u20138:30 pm on NBC.  The timeslot was deliberate.  It was a time when many people were shopping in department stores, and they could see the show displayed on color televisions at period when color television sets had not yet been widely adopted.  However, many people watching at home were still tuning in to Perry Mason in that timeslot.\n\nReception\nThe first season lost the Saturday night ratings to Perry Mason.  Released at a time when television was saturated with Westerns, the premier episode garnered the following review from Variety:\n\nAnother western is just what Saturday night television needs least, and that's what Bonanza appears to be -- just another western.  For all its pretensions, with a large cast, name guests, color and an hour's length, proves to be little more than a patch work of stock oater ideas without a fresh twist to distinguish it...\nPoor ratings and high production costs led to NBC considering cancellation early in the process, leading to rumors that the show actually was cancelled; but fans wrote in and NBC realized it did have a viable audience.\nThe first season of the series failed to break the Nielsen ranking top 30.\n\nReferences\nFootnotes\nBibliography\nBrooks, Tim; Marsh, Earle F.

Years later, Spike met with Marco of 1605 Studio in Huntington Beach, California, and recorded some songs. In 1999, these songs were released on Suburban Noize Records as the Taxes are Stealing EP. This EP featured the first song ever recorded by the group, \"Evolve\", a song questioning the origins of the native peoples of the Americas.\nAt the time of the EP, the band consisted of eight members, including Pakelika of the Kottonmouth Kings, and members of 20 Dead Flower Children and No Doubt. During this phase of the band's history, the group had an ever-changing lineup and no two shows would be alike.\nIn 2000, the group released a CD titled The New Testament, which featured new songs as well as three songs from the previous EP. It also featured a new lineup including the first appearance of vocalist Adawee the Wind.\n2005 saw the release of the Born Again CD and also saw the departure of the Taxman.\n\nDiscography\nTaxes Are Stealing EP (2000)\nThe New Testament (2000)\nFreedom Is a State of Mind (2001)\nBorn Again (2005)\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nCorporate Avenger at AllMusic \nCorporate Avenger discography at MusicBrainz","42":"The Crimson Avenger is the name of three separate superheroes and supervillains in the DC Comics Universe. The character debuted in 1938 and is notable as the first masked hero in DC Comics.\nThe first Crimson Avenger, Lee Walter Travis, first appeared in Detective Comics #20 (October 1938). He is also known as a founding member of DC's second depicted superhero team, Seven Soldiers of Victory.\n\nFictional character biography\nLee Walter Travis\nThe Crimson Avenger (along with his sidekick Wing) first appeared in the DC Comics anthology American comic book series Detective Comics in issue #20.\nThe Crimson Avenger had many similarities to The Green Hornet, including a sidekick named Wing who was an Asian valet, and a gas gun that he used to subdue opponents.\n\nAlbert Elwood\nAlbert Elwood made a single appearance as the Crimson Avenger, in World's Finest Comics #131 (February 1963), in a story entitled \"The Mystery of the Crimson Avenger\". Eccentric inventor Albert Elwood adopted the guise and attempted to help Superman, Batman and Robin thwart the robberies of the Octopus Gang. A requisite identity confusion occurs when one of the Gang members assumed the Crimson Avenger's identity. Elwood helped the heroes capture the gang and retired right afterward. He had many sophisticated gadgets, but his efforts often proved counterproductive, more a hindrance than a help. Elwood did mention that he had \"taken the name of a former lawman\", meaning the by-then long defunct original Crimson Avenger.\nAfter the introduction of the DC Comics multiverse in the 1960s, the original Crimson Avenger (Lee Travis) was explained to have lived on Earth-Two; Albert Elwood's Earth has never been specified.\n\nJill Carlyle\nA female Crimson Avenger first appeared in Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E. #9 (April 2000), created by Geoff Johns and Scott Kolins. This version, like the original El Diablo, served as a minor Spirit of Vengeance. She was an African American woman who possessed the powers of teleportation and intangibility. In a flashback sequence, it was revealed that Carlyle studied law but apparently lost a case in which the defendant was clearly guilty. She obtained a pair of Colt pistols originally owned by the first Crimson Avenger and used them to exact vengeance upon the unknown criminal. These guns are cursed such that, if the possessor uses them out of revenge, he or she will be cursed to track and kill those who have taken an innocent life. Carlyle becomes the Crimsom Avenger after taking revenge on the unknown criminal and, also as part of the curse, an ever-bleeding bullet hole appears on her chest. This version was never given a name, but is referred to by fans as Jill Carlyle, a name taken from the headstone of a victim the character was shown avenging in an early appearance. Whether the Avenger is Carlyle herself or not remains unclear.\nWhile the Avenger's curse sends her after those who have taken an innocent life, an encounter with Wildcat and Power Girl reveals that \"innocent\" only has to mean that the victim was innocent of whatever circumstances led to their deaths. Crimson Avenger once targeted Wildcat for causing a man's death, but Wildcat revealed that his \"victim\" had already killed his own brother and the man's wife and son after they killed his fianc\u00e9; Wildcat planted evidence to frame the dead man for his fianc\u00e9's murder as he couldn't prove the man's real crime, and it was up to the legal system if the dead man was executed afterwards.\nIn the pages of \"The New Golden Age\", Crimson Avenger assembles the Seven Soldiers of Victory and takes them on a mission that involved Clock King using Per Degaton's time machine on the ship where Lee Travis sacrificed his life on.\n\nOther versions\nIn Michael Uslan's Elseworlds title Batman: Detective No. 27, the Crimson Avenger appears as part of an order of detectives including Alfred Pennyworth and Sam Spade and attempts to recruit Bruce Wayne.\nIn The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier, the Crimson Avenger is briefly mentioned as having met with Allan Quatermain and Mina Murray during their self-exile from Britain during the years of the Ingsoc government. A photo of Allan and Murray standing in front of the Crimson Avenger's second costume is shown.\nThe Crimson Avenger makes an appearance in the Justice League of America 80-Page Giant #1 comic (November 2009) in a story titled Zatanna & Black Canary in Fishnet Femmes Fatales!, when the two heroines are tossed back in time by the supervillain Epoch.\nIn Kingdom Come, Alex Ross portrayed the character as a giant demon imprisoned in the Gulag. Naming him \"King Crimson\" in a nod to the band of the same name, his look owes more to his standard superhero look than his previous pulp fiction costume.\nIn the pages of L.E.G.I.O.N., Garv assumed a masked identity after quitting the team, calling himself the Crimson Avenger. He dropped the identity when he returned to the team near the end of the series.\nIn Blue Griffin Comics, a short-lived comic endeavor, the forerunner superhero was to be named Crimson Avenger. His suit was more closely related to typical superhero style with bright red boots, gloves, trunks, and cape, while the rest of his outfit and mask were a darker shade of red. He sported a \"C\" crest on his chest and had energy manipulation powers similar to the Green Lantern, but he could not turn his energy projections into objects.\n\nIn other media\nThe Lee Travis version of Crimson Avenger makes cameo appearances in Justice League Unlimited This version is a member of the Justice League.\nCrimson Avenger also appears in issue #33 of the comic book tie-in Justice League Adventures, in which he is revealed to be among the oldest members of the Justice League who began fighting crime sometime after the 1930s.\nThe Lee Travis incarnation of Crimson Avenger appears in a photograph in the Stargirl episode \"Brainwave\" as a member of the Seven Soldiers of Victory.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nEarth-2 Crimson Avenger (Travis) Index\nWho's Who: Crimson Avenger (Elwood)","43":"The fifth season of Dynasty originally aired in the United States on ABC from September 26, 1984, through May 15, 1985. The series, created by Richard and Esther Shapiro and produced by Aaron Spelling, revolves around the Carringtons, a wealthy family residing in Denver, Colorado.\nSeason five stars John Forsythe as millionaire oil magnate Blake Carrington; Linda Evans as his wife Krystle; Jack Coleman as Blake and Alexis' earnest son Steven; Gordon Thomson as Blake and Alexis' eldest son Adam; John James as Blake's former son-in-law Jeff Colby; Pamela Bellwood as Steven's wife, Claudia; Heather Locklear as Krystle's niece and Steven's ex-wife Sammy Jo; Michael Nader as Alexis' husband Dex Dexter; Catherine Oxenberg as Blake and Alexis' youngest daughter, Amanda; Michael Praed as Amanda's fianc\u00e9 Prince Michael of Moldavia; Diahann Carroll as Blake's half-sister Dominique Deveraux; Billy Dee Williams as Dominique's husband, Brady Lloyd; Rock Hudson as Sammy Jo's biological father, Daniel Reece; Ali MacGraw as photographer Lady Ashley Mitchell; and Joan Collins as Alexis Colby, Blake's ex-wife and the mother of Adam, Fallon, Steven and Amanda. The season also introduced recast Emma Samms as Blake and Alexis' daughter Fallon.\n\nDevelopment\nDriven by the new head writer and producer Camille Marchetta, who had devised the wildly successful \"Who Shot J.R.?\" scenario on Dallas five years earlier, Dynasty hit #1 in the fifth season. During the season, Dynasty attracted controversy when Rock Hudson's real-life HIV-positive status was revealed after a romantic storyline between his character Daniel Reece and Evans' Krystle. Hudson's scenes required him to kiss Evans and, as news that he had contracted AIDS broke, there was speculation Evans would be at risk. The event led to a Screen Actors Guild rule requiring the notification of performers in advance of any scenes that require open-mouth kissing.\nUndoubtedly the most famous Dynasty cliffhanger is the so-called \"Moldavian Massacre\" which occurs in the May 15, 1985 fifth-season finale. Amanda and Prince Michael's royal wedding is interrupted by terrorists during a military coup in Moldavia, riddling the chapel with bullets and leaving all of the major characters lying seemingly lifeless. Esther Shapiro later said, \"It was a fairy-tale terrorist attack. It was beautifully shot, like a Goya painting.\" It became the most talked-about episode of any TV series during the calendar year of 1985, with a viewership of 25.9 million. In 2011, Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly named it one of the seven \"Unforgettable Cliff-Hangers\" of prime time dramatic television.\n\nPlot\nIn the story, Alexis is exonerated for Mark's murder and her secret daughter Amanda comes to Denver and discovers that Blake is her father. Steven has married Claudia but leaves her for another man, and Claudia starts an affair with Adam. The marriage of Blake and Krystle is in crisis after the birth of their daughter Krystina; Dominique struggles to be accepted as a Carrington, and loses her husband Brady Lloyd in the process; and Sammy Jo discovers she is the heiress to a huge fortune. At the end of the season, an amnesiac Fallon reappears while the rest of the family go to Europe for the wedding of Amanda and Prince Michael of Moldavia.\n\nCast\nCast notes\n\nEpisodes\nReception\nIn season five, Dynasty was ranked #1 in the United States with a 25.0 Nielsen rating.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nDynasty at IMDb","44":"The Dodge Avenger is a front-wheel drive, mid-sized sedan that was marketed by Dodge. The Avenger made its North American debut in 1994 for the 1995 model year as a coupe that was produced until 2000. The model name was reintroduced to the market as a four-door sedan in 2007 for the 2008 model year. The Dodge Avenger name was used on the South African market Hillman Avengers in 1975 and 1976.\nThe 2014 model year marked the end of Avenger production as the mid-sized models for both the Dodge and Chrysler brands were consolidated into the new Chrysler 200 introduced for the 2015 model year while Dodge received the new compact Dart.\n\nNameplate history\nThe first use of the Dodge Avenger name was on a badge-engineered version of the European Hillman Avenger, exclusive to South Africa. The same car was sold in North America as the Plymouth Cricket between 1972 and 1974. In place of the Hillman engines, this version used a Peugeot 1.6 L engine (as also installed in locally assembled Peugeot 404s) to satisfy local content requirements. The Dodge-branded Avenger was introduced in 1975 and was then renamed Chrysler in 1976. This generation has nothing in common with later Dodge Avengers. After Chrysler ZA was merged into Sigma in 1976, the Avenger was soon canceled to allow Sigma to free up more production capacity for the Mazda 323.\nThe Avenger nameplate returned as a 2023 subcompact Jeep model available as a plug-in hybrid version or an all-electric drivetrain.\n\nDodge Avenger Coupe (1995\u20132000)\nIntroduced as a two-door coupe in North America, the Dodge Avenger was built from 1994 until 2000 in a similar size and price class as the Dodge Daytona, which was discontinued in February 1993.\nThe Avenger, along with the similar Chrysler Sebring coupe, was built by Diamond Star Motors (DSM), a joint venture between Chrysler Corporation and Mitsubishi Motors, on a version of the Mitsubishi Galant platform (which also spawned the similar Mitsubishi Eclipse). Chrysler sold its equity stake to Mitsubishi in 1993. Diamond-Star Motors was renamed Mitsubishi Motors Manufacturing America (MMMA) on July 1, 1995. Avengers and Sebring coupes built from 1994 until 1996 have DSM identification in their engine compartments.\nThe Avenger was built on a 103.7 in (2,634 mm) wheelbase and used either a 2.0 L inline-four engine (the Chrysler 420A) or a Mitsubishi-designed 2.5 L V6. The four-cylinder was coupled to a five-speed manual transmission, shared with the Mitsubishi Eclipse and Eagle Talon, or a four-speed automatic. The V6 engine was only available with the A604 automatic transmission. The Avengers featured a fully independent double wishbone suspension and variable-speed rack-and-pinion steering.\nTrims included the Highline base model (the V6 engine, among other options, were made standard in 2000) and the ES.\n\nModel year changes\n1995\nA DOHC 16-valve 2.0 L I4 engine (140 hp (104 kW; 142 PS) and 130 lb\u22c5ft (176 N\u22c5m) of torque) is standard. A SOHC 24-valve 2.5 L V6 engine and an automatic transmission (155 hp (116 kW; 157 PS) and 160 lb\u22c5ft (217 N\u22c5m) of torque) are optional on the ES. Fog lamps and ABS are optional on the ES.\n\n1996\nPower and torque ratings for the V6 are increased (163 horsepower, 170 lb\u22c5ft (230 N\u22c5m) torque), and the ES coupes had new seat fabric\nOBD-II is standard\nNew colors\nA universal garage door opener was added as an option\n\n1997\nStandard were 16-inch wheels, and the license plate was moved from the decklid to the rear bumper. The front and rear fasciae were redesigned. A Sport model was introduced (in addition to the base and ES). The Avenger Sport package consisted of exclusive 16-inch aluminum wheels and a body-color spoiler. This appearance package was available on the base model.\nA body-color rear spoiler, P215\/50HR17 tires, and 17-inch cast-aluminum wheels were added for the ES. The V6 is also standard for the ES, and rear disc brakes.\n\n1998\nAn onboard recycling vapor recovery system, Cafe Latte exterior color, and a black and gray interior color combination are added.\n\n1999\nNext-generation driver and front passenger airbags are added, as well as a new exterior color: Shark Blue. The V6 engine and automatic transmission are standard on all models in mid-year, as well as several options. An antilock braking system (ABS) was used in all ES models until 1999.\n\n2000\nFor the 2000 model year, the V6 and automatic transmission combination were standard on all Avengers, and ABS was an \"option\" for ES models. The four-cylinder engine was no longer available. Standard features that had previously been optional included power windows and locks. Base models added cruise control and four-wheel disc brakes. The ES coupes now come with standard leather upholstery, keyless remote entry, and a power driver's seat.\n\nReplacement\nThe coupe did not achieve high sales numbers, so in 2000, the Avenger was discontinued. It was replaced by the Dodge Stratus coupe for the 2001 model year. This coupe utilized the third-generation Eclipse platform and architecture. Mitsubishi assembled it at the former Diamond Star plant. However, the Stratus sedan was engineered and built by Chrysler.\n\nDodge Avenger sedan (2007\u20132014)\nThe Dodge Avenger nameplate returned in February 2007 as a 2008 model year sedan to replace the Dodge Stratus, whose coupe version had replaced the original Avenger in 2001.\nLike its Dodge Journey stablemate, the Avenger's exterior was styled by Chrysler's Ryan Nagode. Ben S. Chang designed the interior.\nThe Avenger was officially unveiled as a concept car at the Paris Motor Show on 28 September 2006. It was launched in Europe and marketed in the United Kingdom, filling a gap in the Chrysler range left by the Neon's discontinuation four years earlier. It was also launched in Australia with only the 2.4 L engine. The Avenger was discontinued in that market in 2010 due to slow sales. The 2007 through 2014 models were sold in New Zealand.\nAccording to some reports, the Avenger and the redesigned Chrysler Sebring share a DaimlerChrysler\/Mitsubishi Motors platform called JS, which used the Mitsubishi GS as a starting point. The SE and SXT trim levels' base engine was the 2.4 L GEMA I4 naturally aspirated \"World Engine\", a joint venture between DaimlerChrysler, Mitsubishi, and Hyundai. Additional engines included an optional 2.7 L V6 in the SXT and a standard 3.5 L V6 in the R\/T trim level. In addition to the 2.4 L World Engine and the V6s, export vehicles were offered with the 2.0 L naturally aspirated World Engine, as well as a 2.0 L turbocharged diesel (Pumpe-D\u00fcse) made by Volkswagen.\n\n2008\nAlthough a 2008 model, the Dodge Avenger was available in February 2007. In the U.S. market, the Avenger was launched with a 30-second television advertisement, \"Tuned Up\", that debuted on 4 March 2007, during NHL hockey, an ad in which a lab technician discovers he can play \"Smoke on the Water\" by Deep Purple on the Avenger's transmission. Another television spot likened the Avenger to the \"superhero\" vehicle for the everyman, depicting a driver piloting his Avenger through Gotham-like streets and alleys, speaking to the MyGig entertainment system in distinctly Batman-reminiscent tones, to arrive home, pull into a two-car garage, and open the rear door to a sleeping child in the rear car seat.\nFeatures on the new Avenger included optional heated\/cooled cup holders and Dodge's new \"Chill Zone\", a feature that comes standard on all Avenger models, which can store up to four 12-US-fl oz cans in the glove box and chill them to 40 \u00b0F.\nThe Avenger competed directly with the Chevrolet Malibu and Ford Fusion, with the 2007 and later Chrysler Sebring being aimed at the higher-priced American cars such as the Mercury Milan, Pontiac G6, and Saturn Aura.\n\n2009\nFor the 2009 model year, like its Caliber, Charger, Grand Caravan, Journey, and Nitro models, the \"AVENGER\" badge at the trunk lid's left was repositioned to the right side to make way for \"DODGE\" at the left.\nFollowing Fiat's takeover of Chrysler Group, marketing of the Avenger was discontinued in the United Kingdom. Sales of the Avenger continued in the Republic of Ireland and Western Europe until late 2009, following Fiat's takeover of Chrysler Group. This version continued with SE and SXT trim levels but was not badged the same way as North American or South American versions.\n\n2010\nUnder the influence of Fiat, the 2010 model year Avenger sedan had few changes.New were front side and head-curtain airbags as well as head-impact protection in the front seats. The optional all-wheel drive was discontinued, limiting the Avenger to only front-wheel drive. The 2.7 L V6 was dropped, leaving two different drivetrains: a 2.4 L (173 hp (129 kW; 175 PS) I4 with four-speed automatic transmission (the SXT model) or a 3.5 L (235 hp (175 kW; 238 PS) V6 with AutoStick six-speed (available on the R\/T). The Avenger featured a soft ride while the R\/T versions included a firmer suspension, front and rear stabilizer bars, and 18-inch wheels.\n\n2011\nFor the 2011 model year, the Avenger received its first significant overhaul since its 2008 reintroduction. Exterior changes include slightly revised sheet metal with a new crosshair grille displaying the new Dodge logo on the lower right corner of the grille, a sleeker bumper cut design, and standard LED combination taillights. Changes to the interior are more noticeable with a completely redesigned dashboard and instrument panel featuring an available 6.5-inch navigation\/media center screen. Higher-quality soft-touch plastics for dashboard, door, and trim panels replaced the old materials, which were criticized for their poor fit and finish quality, as well as being unpleasant to the touch. The seats receive better cushioning and higher-grade upholstery. Two-tone interior color combinations were available.\nMechanically, the 2011 Avenger came standard with the existing 173 hp (129 kW) 2.4 L GEMA I4. However, it was now paired with a six-speed automatic or the option of having the previous four-speed. Also available was the new 3.6 L Pentastar V6, rated at 283 hp (211 kW) and 260 lb\u22c5ft (350 N\u22c5m) of torque. The suspension was revised to improve handling and ride quality. Trim level designations were replaced by Express, Mainstreet, Lux, and Heat models.\nThe Dodge Avenger was ranked the \"Most American Made\" sedan by the American University's Kogod School of Business 2013 Made in America Auto Index. The Dodge Avenger also has an overall rating of 6.7.\n\nTrims\nSE: (2007\u20132009, 2012\u20132013) The \"base\" trim level from 2007 to 2009, and then again from 2012 to 2013.\n2.0 L VW TDI PD I4 DOHC 16V CRD 6-speed manual\n2.4 L GEMA I4 DOHC 16V Dual VVT 4-speed automatic\nSXT: (2007\u20132010, 2012\u20132013) The \"volume\" trim level from 2007 to 2010, and again from 2012 to 2013.\n2.0 L VW TDI PD I4 DOHC 16V CRD 6-speed manual\n2.4 L GEMA I4 DOHC 16V Dual VVT 4-speed automatic\n2.7 L EER V6 DOHC 24-valve MPI 4-speed automatic\n2.4 L GEMA I4 DOHC 16V Dual VVT 6-speed automatic\n3.6 L Pentastar V6 DOHC 24V MPI 6-speed automatic\nSXT Plus: (2012) One of the more \"uplevel\" trim levels in 2012.

The car received an overall \"Acceptable\" rating in the small overlap test due to marginal dummy kinematics and slight intrusion into the passenger compartment. In the side test, the Avenger earned a \"Good\" rating; however, rib fractures were possible for the driver. In the roof strength evaluation, it gained a \"Good\" rating, as well as for its head restraints and seats.\nThe Avenger earned the \"Top Safety Pick\" award in 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2014 as well as earned the \"Top Safety Pick+\" award in 2013.\n\nDiscontinuation\nThe discontinuation of the Dodge Avenger was announced by the automaker in early 2014, along with the end of the Chrysler 200 convertible model. The final 2014 model year Avengers were produced during the first quarter 2014. \nThe Avenger nameplate has since been revived as the Jeep Avenger with the 2023 model year.\n\nMotorsport\nThe first-generation Dodge Avenger body style was widely used in the National Hot Rod Association and earned the most prominence driven by Darrell Alderman and Scott Geoffrion from 1994 until 2000 as the Dodge Boys.\nThe coupe was used for the 1994 and 1995 incarnations of the International Race of Champions. Although Dodge was IROC's car of choice since 1990, Dodge dropped out of this racing series after the 1995 season.\nAvenger sheet metal was also used on race cars by several ARCA race teams from 1995 until 2000.\nThe Avenger replaced the Charger as Dodge's car for the 2007 NASCAR Nextel Cup Season. It appeared in Dodge Avenger grille, headlights, and taillights as the standard \"spec\" Car of Tomorrow (CoT) model. It got its first win with former Formula One driver Juan Pablo Montoya in the 2007 Toyota\/Save Mart 350 at the Infineon Raceway.\nIn 2008, the Dodge CoT appearance was changed back to the Charger model.\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\n\"2008 Dodge Avenger Product Heritage\" (Press release).

It was designed in California and manufactured in the United States and Canada for 12 years, from late 1966 until 1978.\n\nHistory\nThe Avenger GT was the successor to the Aztec in Fiberfab's lineup. Some of the company's early documentation refers to it as the Aztec Avenger GT. The Avenger GT's styling recalls the Ford GT40 \u2014 the Mk.I and Mk.III GT40s in particular \u2014 but is not an exact copy of the racing car. It was a less expensive alternative to the Fiberfab Valkyrie, which looked like an Avenger GT with a short rear deck and had a custom chassis with room for a mid-mounted V8 engine.\nFiberfab started producing Avenger GT kits in Sunnyvale, California in Santa Clara County in 1966. They moved to Freemont, California in 1967. They also had a facility in Bridgeville, PA to supply demand on the East coast.\nA separate company called Fiberfab Canada Limited (FCL) was incorporated in Canada and after 1970 began producing long door Avenger GT kits in a facility in Dauphin, Manitoba. This operation relocated to Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1971, and then to Ontario in 1974.\nProduction of Avenger GTs ended in 1978. The total number of kits made was in the thousands.\n\nFeatures\nInstead of the two single lamps fitted to the Aztec, the Avenger GT was equipped with quad headlamps. The Avenger GT's tail section was longer than the Valkyrie's so that it could cover the car's rear-mounted engine, giving it an appearance closer to that of a GT40 Mk.III.\nThe Avenger GT's windshield is the standard unit from a second generation (1965\u201369) Chevy Corvair, while the backlight is from a 1965 or 1966 Ford Mustang 2+2 Fastback. \nThere were several options for side windows. The original Fiberfab manuals described an arrangement that used a wind-wing from a 1965 Mustang in combination with door glass from a 1966 Ford LTD and a regulator from a VW Karman Ghia. Another option used a custom single piece glass side window supplied by Fiberfab, but the original molds for this were lost. Side windows from Plexiglass or Lexan were special order items.\nThere are long door cars and short door cars. The short door cars were built prior to 1970, and have a rocker panel below the door edge. The long door reaches all the way to the bottom of the car body and is a bit wider. \nThe earliest models could be ordered with or without the GT40 style twin hood scoops. \nThe choice of taillamps was left up to the builder, some of whom used early Mustang or Maverick units.\n\nAvenger GT-12 and GT-15\nThe Avenger GT line included two models: the Avenger GT-12, and the Avenger GT-15.\nThe GT-12 was designed to be built on a Volkswagen Type 1 backbone chassis from a Volkswagen Beetle or Karmann Ghia, adjusted for width as necessary. With the chassis came the donor VW's front suspension of upper and lower trailing arms, torsion leaf springs and telescopic shock absorbers, and rear suspension of swing axle or semi-trailing arms, torsion bars and telescopic shocks. The donor car's original 4-speed transaxle and four cylinder Volkswagen air-cooled engine could be kept, but other options, including Porsche or Corvair engines, could be substituted. At roughly 1,500 lb (680.4 kg), the GT-12 weighed approximately 500 lb (226.8 kg) less than a standard Beetle.\nThe GT-15 was similar in appearance to the GT-12, but included a custom chassis designed to accept suspension and drive-train components from a Chevrolet Corvair. Installing a Corvair front sub-frame put upper and lower A-arms with coil springs and telescopic shocks in front, with or without an Anti-roll bar. At the rear was a semi-trailing arm suspension with coil springs and telescopic shocks. The default rear-mounted Chevrolet Turbo-Air 6 engine provided power through a 3 or 4-speed manual Chevrolet transaxle.\n\nAvenger GT-12X and GT-15X\nLater models of the Avenger GT were designated with an X and received minor body revisions. These usually included long-style doors, flared wheel arches, and a front spoiler.\n\nNASA Battery-electric vehicle\nTo test electric vehicle propulsion systems using a special dynamomoter called the \"Road Load Simulator\" (RLS), NASA commissioned construction of a special vehicle that was designed from the outset as an electric vehicle. A custom ladder chassis with outriggers was built by \"Electric Vehicle Engineering Co.\" (EVE) of Boston, Massachusetts. Configured for front wheel drive, the car's running gear was from Saab. The body was a Fiberfab shell, and appears to have been an Avenger GT.\n\nGallery\nReferences\nExternal links\n\"Avenger-Valkyrie\". 29 June 2013. Archived from the original on 4 March 2015.

The word \"ataraxia\" in the title is a Greek term for \"tranquility\", giving the title the combined meaning of \"empty (or false) tranquility\".\nThe game also was ported to PlayStation Vita, adding full-voice acting, among other enhancements. This version was released in Japan on November 27, 2014.\n\nPlot\nThe plot of Fate\/hollow ataraxia is set about 8 months after the events of Fate\/stay night. Like its predecessor, the story is set in Fuyuki City. Bazett Fraga McRemitz, a member of the Mages' Association and a master in the Fifth Holy Grail War, wakes on the fourth day of the Fifth Holy Grail war with a new servant, Avenger, and no memory of what happened to her beforehand. She and Avenger set off to fight and win the Holy Grail War.\nMeanwhile, Shirou Emiya lives a peaceful life with all of his friends from the Fifth Holy Grail War. After one of her experiments changes time and space, Rin Tohsaka leaves for the Mages' Association in England to fix things. The Servants sense a new danger while dark creatures appear soon afterward. Shirou, as a precaution, sets off to ensure nobody is in danger and instead finds himself frequently meeting a mysterious girl, Caren Ortensia.\nBoth Bazett and Shirou find themselves in a time loop that lasts four days, beginning on the fourth day of the Fifth Holy Grail War. Each time they die or survive four days, they always awake on the first day of the loop, aware of what has happened to them since the first time loop began. Determined to end the loop, Bazett, Avenger, and Shirou fight to discover the truth behind what is causing the endless four days.\n\nCharacters\nBazett Fraga McRemitz (\u30d0\u30bc\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30d5\u30e9\u30ac\u30fb\u30de\u30af\u30ec\u30df\u30c3\u30c4, Bazetto Furaga Makuremittsu)\nVoiced by: Hitomi Nabatame (Fate\/tiger colosseum, Fate\/unlimited codes, Carnival Phantasm, Fate\/kaleid liner Prisma Illya (anime), and Fate\/hollow ataraxia (PSVita))\nThe first of the three protagonists. A mage from the Knights of the Red Branch sent by the Mage's Association to fight the Fifth Holy Grail War, born in Ireland as a descendant of old mage family. She originally summoned Lancer (her childhood hero), but was betrayed by her old colleague Kotomine and had her left arm with its Command Seals stolen. She was left for dead before she was discovered by Avenger, who created the time loop inside of Bazett's mind, so that she could stay alive from her fatal injuries. Bazett can directly fight and defeat Servants due to her family's combat-based magecraft and her ancestral Noble Phantasm: the sacred dagger Fragarach, which reverses time so that it always strikes first in response to her opponent's ultimate attack. She is mentioned very briefly in Fate\/stay night but does not make an appearance.\nCaren Ortensia (\u30ab\u30ec\u30f3\u30fb\u30aa\u30eb\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30a2, Karen Orutenshia)\nVoiced by Ami Koshimizu (Fate\/tiger colosseum, the All Around Type-Moon Drama CD, Carnival Phantasm, Fate\/kaleid liner Prisma Illya (anime) and Fate\/hollow ataraxia (PSVita))\nA new and central character to the story, Caren is a member of the Church and works as a priestess. She is kind and forgiving to the point that she believes her only purpose in life is to help others, even if she is hurt in the process. She never blames the person who has hurt her and blames the act on demons who caused the person to commit the sin. Whenever she is at fault, she apologizes to God rather than the person. Despite her kindness, she has a love for teasing and exploiting others' emotional vulnerability. Upon discovery of an individual's weak spot, she enjoys bringing it out to light in front of all to witness. While this antagonizes many characters and causes much outrage and humiliation, she herself remains calm. Also, in spite of being a priestess, she has deliberately chosen to wear a revealing costume with no skirt to both increase her mobility and to seduce men.\nAs a member of the Church, Caren assists in exorcisms. Her body itself possesses an unusual property: if there is a person nearby who has been possessed by a demon, she will experience the same pain as the possessed person. As a result, exorcists employ her to act as a radar of sorts to find demons. This ability is most evident whenever she comes in proximity to the Servant Avenger as her body sprouts grotesque spikes. As a result of this power, she is always covered in bandages. She also experiences physical pain whenever people in proximity do evil things. In battle, she uses a red cloth of Magdala, which has the power to forcefully bind men. However, while the man is bound, no harmful physical attacks can be made against him or Magdala will be rendered useless. She is actually the daughter of Kotomine Kirei and hates him for abandoning her. In the epilogue, she has some interest in Shirou due to her close interactions with Avenger in the time loop, even painting him with oil to resemble the latter. She also wields control over Lancer, much to Bazett's dismay, as compensation for having saved Bazett, and refuses to return the Command Seals to Bazett unless she can have Bazett's current artificial hand, which the both of them have come to see as a sentimental reminder of Avenger.\nAvenger (\u30a2\u30f4\u30a7\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc, Avenger)\nVoiced by (Takuma Terashima in Fate\/tiger colosseum, Fate\/hollow ataraxia (PSVita), and Fate\/Grand Order)\nThe 8th Servant, who was summoned in the 3rd war in lieu of a Berserker and another of the main protagonists. Avenger was originally a normal boy in the ancient middle east who, in a cruel twist of fate, was labeled as Angra Mainyu via a random lottery and was tortured until he died of old age so that he, as the embodiment of evil itself, could allow the other villagers to live free of sin and as a result became the first \"Anti-Hero\" to enter the Throne of Heroes, as well as becoming the model from which all martyrs within the Throne of Heroes stem from. He was later summoned as Avenger in the Third Grail War by the Einzbern in an attempt to cheat, but was the first to die (as he is not the actual Angra Mainyu, who had long since left for the Other Side of the World) and corrupted the Grail, as the belief of others had made him into All The World's Evils even though the Grail recognized him as a human with a wish it needed to fulfill (his own rebirth as Angra Mainyu), his presence within the Grail is what allows for the summoning of some of history and mythology's greatest villains and monsters as \"heroes\". He was released when Emiya Shirou and Saber utterly annihilated the Grail at the end of the Fifth Grail War and came across a dying Bazett and responded to her wish to live, by creating the time loop inside of Bazett's mind and created replicas of characters this dream world, but as he did not personally experience the Fifth Grail War, he instead recreated it using the Fifth's replica participants and with the Third Grail War's development as the base. He then took part in the loop using Emiya Shirou's body as a shell, allowing him to experience the peaceful daily life that Shirou experiences. He wields a pair of misshapen and brittle daggers in combat and his Noble Phantasm is \"Verg Avesta\" which reflects the pain caused by an opponent's attack back at them. He eventually decides to end the loop after realizing all the trouble he has caused and, with help from his new friends and allies, fights off the pieces of him that protect the Grail and ends the loop for good, but not before using the hidden crack that was opened in space-time of reality in real world made by Rin's copy of the Jeweled Sword of Zelretch by transfer and stabilize the timeline he helped create in the mind of Bazett, thus reviving the participants who died in the real Fifth Holy Grail War more than half a year ago (Masters and Servants, except Kotomine Kirei) and transferring the memories that Avenger did when he acted as Shirou for the true Shirou, so he can live and act on them (except the parts concerning Avenger and his remains as Shades so to hide his existence from Shirou) and so Shirou, Caren, and Bazett can live out whatever life they had made in this new timeline.\nShirou Emiya (\u885b\u5bae \u58eb\u90ce, Emiya Shir\u014d)\n\nHe is one of the three main protagonists in the story. Within this installment, Shirou experiences unexpected changes in personality and momentary lapses in memory, particularly related to his own skills. It is later revealed that this is because \"Shirou\" is connected to Avenger in some mysterious way, causing them to switch places when night falls, implying Avenger is either hiding in Shir\u014d's body or is taking his form during the day, but forgets due to his \"non-existence\" being overwritten by the earth's laws. Once Shirou\/Avenger discovers the truth, he becomes conflicted, as Shirou, with his naive sense of justice, wants to end the loop while Avenger wants to keep living his days out as Shirou, constantly repeating the cycle so that he can experience, by proxy, the life of a normal boy that he never had. When he finally convinces Bazett to finish the word loop, it is revealed that Shirou being possessed by Avenger was nothing more than a replica of Shirou that Avenger created to realize his personal desire, while the real Shirou and his friends were still present in the real world, in Fuyuki, after the events of Fifth Holy Grail War and having passed more than half a year. Once Avenger finally ends the loop and frees Bazett, before completely disappearing Avenger\/Grail found the hidden crack that opened with the experiment caused by Rin to use the copy Zelretch's Jeweled Sword which she obtained with the help of Shirou and Illya six months after the Fifth Holy Grail War and using what was left of his power as Grail, Avenger corrected the slot and replaced the original timeline with the one he helped to create in Bazett's mind, thus reviving the Masters and Servants who died or disappeared (in the case of Saber) during the conflict (except Kotomine Kirei) and transferring the memories of all the times when the replicas of Fuyuki people who were present in the world loop made, including the true Shirou, so he and his friends would not be suspicious that the Masters and Servants who died more than half a year were killed really and making them think that they survived the end of Fifth Holy Grail War and living with them all this time, with the only people knowing all occurring being only Bazett, Caren, Illya, and Caster. In epilogue, the true Shirou is tricked into allowing Bazett and Caren stay at the Emiya household.\nSaber (\u30bb\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc, Seib\u0101)\n\nSaber is portrayed as having become more willing to open up and try and embrace her gender, rather than rejecting it as she did before, and engages in traditionally feminine tasks such as baking and is willing to wear more overtly feminine clothes (i.e. a bikini or a blouse) if it means impressing Shirou, as the lack of combat during the daytime and co-habitation with Rider and Rin has made Saber extremely self-conscious over her lack of femininity. She has also gained a taste for Japanese sweets, venturing out into town on her own to purchase them with the allowance Taiga gives her. She remains fiercely loyal to Shirou\/Avenger and several times puts her life on the line (and loses it) to protect him. As she gets more in touch with her gender, Saber also begins to reveal more about her real personality: she is loyal and brave, but is also painfully shy and gets extremely jealous when other girls express interest in her master, such as when Shirou\/Avenger has dinner with Sakura. If the player follows her character arc far enough, Saber will eventually confide in Shirou\/Avenger that, while she loves living in Japan with him and their friends, she is beginning to feel homesick and wishes to return to England someday if only to visit, hoping that Shirou will come with her. Saber Alter also exists within her, and comes out whenever Saber's stray hair strand is pulled off, though it regenerates with time; Saber Alter is portrayed as the opposite of Saber, as she is blunt, loud, no-nonsense, and enjoys cheap, greasy fast food such as hamburgers.\nRin Tohsaka (\u9060\u5742 \u51db, T\u014dsaka Rin)\n\nIn the first half of the game, Rin is in London. She returns in the second half with an apparently dramatic change in personality (specifically, a penchant for cosplaying as a miko or magical girls). However, she has also become an experienced mage, demonstrating this when she was the first to logically compose an explanation as to why time has been looping for four days and when she gives Shirou advice. In Fate\/hollow ataraxia, she wields the Kaleidostick, another of Zeltretch's inventions which, when activated, transfers knowledge from an alternate version of its user into its current wielder, in addition to providing an ample source of Mana. However, the Kaleidostick dislikes its creator, and frequently manipulates its user into humiliating situations. Her tsundere personality is shown in greater detail here as seen in her interactions. She is shown to be very stingy, bossy and quite mischievous. She makes fun of Shirou several times. She has feelings for Shirou after watching him stubbornly attempting to do a high jump that he had no chance. Although she calls him an idiot, Rin admires Shirou for his tenacity and kind-heart. In Fate\/hollow ataraxia, the Kaleidostick is responsible for transforming Rin into the magical girl Kaleido-Ruby. Rin is partially responsible for the current state of affairs in the universe of Fate\/stay night. After the Fifth Holy Grail War was finished, she and Shirou's sister, Ilyasviel von Einzbern, were experimenting with creating a copy of the legendary Jeweled Sword of Zelretch and accidentally causing with that any outcome can be drawn in Fuyuki, which meant that at any time, the crack that Rin created by accident and was hidden somewhere in the reality of Fuyuki space-time could be used to alter reality and the timeline in which they were living and could be radically changed from overnight anytime. This is proved in the game's prologue, when the game starts and which is the same time the world loop created by Avenger ended to free Bazett of her comatose for more than half a year, the reality that Shirou and his friends knew how finished the Fifth Holy Grail war and all Servants gone with the end of the war was completely changed when Avenger, using his last strength as the Grail before disappearing completely, found that crack and corrected by transfer timeline effects that he had helped to create in the mind of Bazett when he was performing the world loop, causing the Fate, Unlimited Blade Works, and Heaven's Feel routes of the original visual novel to converge into a single timeline and then stabilized by seal that crack, resurrecting in the process the Masters and Servants (except Kotomine, Zouken and True Assassin) who died in that conflict in the real world.\nSakura Matou (\u9593\u6850 \u685c, Mat\u014d Sakura)\n\nSakura has developed greatly as a character. Sakura while still retaining her reticent nature throughout the game starts becoming a self confident and self sufficient person both as a magi and as a leader so much so that she even manages to scold Taiga into submission. Sakura has now become the captain of the school's Archery club where which she diligently leads with great skill under the tutelage of Ayako Mitsuzuri. Sakura has become one of the club's top archers to the point that it leads Taiga to believe they could win tournaments. Sakura now stays at the Emiya residence on weekends, holidays and special occasions while becoming the head of the Matou household having ousted Zouken for control. Rider had even said that both Shinji and Zouken are now afraid of her. Sakura continues to assist in cooking having become a sous chef of sorts to Shirou the primary chef of the household and maintaining the upkeep of the Emiya household. Sakura's specialty is apparently pastries beating every other cook in the game in this regard. She and Rin now have a great relationship truly becoming sisters, with Rin educating her in cooking and magecraft despite that Sakura maintains slight resentment and an inferiority complex towards Rin. When it comes to Shirou she still displays jealousy towards other women when Shirou pays them attention over her and continues to pampers and dotes him. Sakura's evil and sadistic side from the Heaven's Feel route of Fate\/stay night only comes out every now and then as comic relief in the game.\nRider (\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc, Raid\u0101)\nSince the war, Rider has begun staying at the Emiya household, becoming the de facto adult and breadwinner of the home. She got a job at an antique store to bring some much needed income to the household and mocks Saber as being nothing more than a freeloader, though the two made up after Rider bought her some sweets. She has feelings for Shirou due to him being the first male in her life to treat her with care and respect and once had sex with him while he slept, using an illusion to disguise herself within his dreams and openly admitting that she was open to the idea of a polyamorous relationship between herself, Shirou, and Sakura. She, like Saber, is having trouble adjusting to the modern world and must have basic concepts such as apologizing explained to her at length.\nOther characters\nWhile playing less prominent roles, all Masters and Servants of  the fifth Holy Grail War from Fate\/stay night appear again, with the exception of Kirei Kotomine, Zouken Matou and True Assassin, as they were never destined to survive the Fifth Holy Grail War (with Kotomine having been cursed with an artificial heart in the Fourth Holy Grail War, and both Zouken Matou and True Assassin only appeared in the Heaven's Feel route). Despite this, Zouken is mentioned as still being alive by Shinji.\n\nAdaptations\nManga\nThere have been many sets of manga anthologies bases on the series produced by different companies and drawn by a multitude of different artists. The first volume of the earliest anthology series was released by Ichijinsha with the title Fate\/Hollow Ataraxia Anthology Comic, on January 7, 2006 under their DNA Media Comics imprint; the fifteenth volume in the series was released on August 25, 2008. Two anthology series were then released by Kadokawa, the first was Fate\/hollow Ataraxia  ~ Comic la carte, released on January 10, 2006. The second, Fate\/hollow ataraxia Comic a la carte ~Happy Life hen~, was released on May 24, 2006. Another two anthology series were then released by Enterbrain. Fate\/hollow ataraxia Anthology Comic was released between January 30, 2006 and May 25, 2007 in nine volumes under their Magi-Cu Comics imprint. A 4-koma series was later published by Enterbrain between December 25, 2007 and December 25, 2008 in six volumes.\nIn 2013, a Fate\/hollow ataraxia manga illustrated by Medori and published by Kadokawa began serializing.\n\nMusic\nA soundtrack to the game, entitled Fate\/hollow ataraxia Original Sound Track was published by Geneon Entertainment on November 23, 2005. The single \"Hollow\" was released by Type-Moon on October 28, 2005.\n\nReception\nFate\/hollow ataraxia became one of the top selling visual novels of 2005. The PS Vita port sold 53,979 copies within the first week of release in Japan, ranking at fourth place amongst all Japanese software sales for that week's sales charts.\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\nType-Moon official Japanese homepage for Fate\/hollow ataraxia(in Japanese)\nFate\/hollow ataraxia at The Visual Novel Database","47":"The Avenger is a single-seat, Canadian low-wing, tractor configuration ultralight aircraft. The Avenger was introduced in 1994 and is available as a kit or as plans from Fisher Flying Products.\nFisher Flying Products was originally based in Edgeley, North Dakota, United States, but relocated to Vaughan, Ontario, Canada.\n\nDevelopment\nThe Avenger was designed to meet the requirements of the United States FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles regulations, including the maximum 254 lb (115 kg) empty weight. Design goals included low cost, an attractive appearance, and accommodation for a 76 in (193 cm) tall, 240 lb (109 kg) pilot.\nAlthough originally designed to accept the Half VW powerplant (a Type 1 Volkswagen  engine block cut in half), the aircraft empty weight can be reduced to 250 lb (113 kg) with the use of a lighter weight engine, such as the 28 hp (21 kW) Rotax 277 or the 35 hp (26 kW) 2SI 460-35. The Avenger was initially marketed with the now-discontinued Rotax 277 engine, which was criticized as leaving the aircraft dangerously underpowered.\nReviewer Andre Cliche says:\n\nThe Avenger is an experimental-class design that has been re-engined to fall under the ultralight regulations. For this purpose, a 28 hp Rotax 277 has been installed, thus allowing the weight to get lower than the 254 lbs. upper limit imposed on ultralights. This is technically feasible but the switch from a VW engine to a single cylinder Rotax also reduces the performance below a safe level. The rated 400 fpm rate of climb is barely adequate for safe operations. Put this machine in the wrong situation and it can bite you.\n\nDesign\nThe Avenger structure is entirely constructed from wood, with a low wing braced to the landing gear. The wooden-framed wing is covered with aircraft fabric. The engine cowling is fibreglass. The conventional landing gear features a steerable tailwheel and main-gear suspension.\nThe cockpit has a removable canopy.\nThe Avenger has an estimated construction time of 400 hours from the kit.\nIn 2022 the kit price (without paint, varnish, pilot\/passenger restraints, instruments, upholstery, or engine) was US$9320, with the plans selling for US$350.\nRecommended engines include the 50 hp (37 kW) Rotax 503, 40 hp (30 kW) Rotax 447, 35 hp (26 kW) 2SI 460-35 or 38 hp (28 kW) 1\/2 VW.\n\nOperational history\nIn December 2004, the company reported that 50 Avengers were flying, the majority as US unregistered ultralights.\n\nVariants\nAvenger\nWith a regular firewall for two-stroke engines. Engine options are 40 hp (30 kW) Rotax 447, 50 hp (37 kW) Rotax 503, or 28 hp (21 kW) Hirth F-33 or 35 hp (26 kW) 2SI 460-35.

Designed to destroy a wide variety of ground targets, the Avenger delivers 30mm rounds at a high rate of fire. The GAU-8\/A is also used in the Dutch Goalkeeper CIWS ship weapon system, which provides defense against short-range threats such as highly maneuverable missiles, aircraft, and fast-maneuvering surface vessels. The GAU-8\/A was designed by General Electric and has been produced by General Dynamics since 1977.\n\nHistory\nThe GAU-8 was created as a parallel program with the A-X (or Attack Experimental) competition that produced the A-10. The specification for the cannon was laid out in 1970, with General Electric and Philco-Ford offering competing designs. Both of the A-X prototypes, the YA-10 and the Northrop YA-9, were designed to incorporate the weapon, although it was not available during the initial competition; the M61 Vulcan was used as a temporary replacement. Once completed, the entire GAU-8 assembly (correctly referred to as the A\/A 49E-6 Gun System) represents about 16% of the A-10 aircraft's unladen weight. Because the gun plays a significant role in maintaining the A-10's balance and center of gravity, a jack must be installed beneath the airplane's tail whenever the gun is removed for inspection in order to prevent the aircraft from tipping rearwards.\n\nThe gun is mounted slightly to the port side with the active firing cannon barrel on the starboard side at the 9 o'clock position and on the aircraft's center line. The front landing gear is positioned to the starboard side. The gun is loaded using Syn-Tech's linked tube carrier GFU-8\/E 30 mm Ammunition Loading Assembly cart. This vehicle is unique to the A-10 and the GAU-8.\nThe A-10 with its GAU-8\/A gun entered service in 1977. It was produced by General Electric, though General Dynamics Armament and Technical Products has been responsible for production and support since 1997 when the division was sold by Lockheed Martin to General Dynamics.\n\nDesign\nThe GAU-8 itself weighs 620 pounds (280 kg), but the complete weapon, with feed system and drum, weighs 4,029 pounds (1,828 kg) with a maximum ammunition load. It measures 19 ft 5+1\u20442 in (5.931 m) from the muzzle to the rearmost point of the ammunition system, and the ammunition drum alone is 34.5 inches (88 cm) in diameter and 71.5 inches (1.82 m) long. Power for operating the gun is provided by twin hydraulic motors pressurized from two independent hydraulic systems. The magazine can hold 1,174 rounds, although 1,150 is the typical load-out. Muzzle velocity when firing armor-piercing incendiary rounds is 1,013 m\/s, almost the same as the substantially lighter M61 Vulcan's 20 mm round, giving the gun a muzzle energy of just over 200 kilojoules.\n\nThe standard ammunition mixture for anti-armor use is a five-to-one mix of PGU-14\/B Armor Piercing Incendiary, with a projectile weight of about 14.0 oz (395 grams or 6,096 grains) and PGU-13\/B High Explosive Incendiary (HEI) rounds, with a projectile weight of about 13.3 oz (378 grams or 5,833 grains). The PGU-14\/B's projectile incorporates a lightweight aluminum body, cast around a smaller caliber depleted uranium penetrating core. In 1979, the Avenger was tested against M47 Patton tanks and caused \"severe damage\".\nAn innovation in the design of the GAU-8\/A ammunition is the use of aluminum alloy cases in place of the traditional steel or brass. This alone adds 30% to ammunition capacity for a given weight. The projectiles incorporate a plastic driving band to improve barrel life. The cartridges measure 11.4 inches (290 mm) in length and weigh 1.53 pounds (0.69 kg) or more.\n\nThe Avenger's rate of fire was originally selectable, 2,100 rounds per minute (rpm) in the low setting, or 4,200 rpm in the high setting. This rate was later changed to a fixed rate of 3,900 rpm. At this speed it would take 18 seconds of sustained fire to empty the magazine. In practice, the cannon is limited to one and two-second bursts to avoid overheating and conserve ammunition; barrel life is also a factor, since the USAF has specified a minimum life of at least 20,000 rounds for each set of barrels. There is no technical limitation on the duration the gun may be continuously fired, and a pilot could potentially expend the entire ammunition load in a single burst with no damage or ill effects to the weapons system itself. However, this constant rate of fire would shorten the barrel life considerably and require added barrel inspections and result in shorter intervals between replacement.\nEach barrel is a very simple non-automatic design having its own breech and bolt. Like the original Gatling gun, the entire firing cycle is actuated by cams and powered by the rotation of the barrels. The seven-barrel carriage assembly itself is driven by the aircraft's dual hydraulic system.\nThe GAU-8\/A ammunition feed is linkless, reducing weight and avoiding a great deal of potential for jamming. The feed system is double-ended, allowing the spent casings to be returned to the ammunition drum. Additionally, returning empty cases to the drum has less effect on the aircraft's center of gravity than ejecting them. The feed system is based on that developed for later M61 installations, but uses more advanced design techniques and materials throughout, to save weight.\n\nFiring system\nAccuracy\nThe GAU-8\/A is extremely accurate and can fire up to 3,900 rounds per minute without complications. The 30-mm shell has twice the range, half the time to target, and three times the mass of projectiles fired by guns mounted in comparable close air support aircraft.\nWhile the GAU-8\/A has a muzzle velocity that is comparable to that of the M61 Vulcan, it uses heavier ammunition and has superior ballistics. The time of flight of its projectile to 4,000 feet (1,200 m) is 30 percent less than that of an M61 round; the GAU-8\/A projectile decelerates much less after leaving the barrel, and it drops a negligible amount, about 10 feet (3.0 m) over the distance. The GAU-8\/A precision when installed in the A-10 is rated at \"5 mil, 80 percent\", meaning that 80 percent of rounds fired will hit within a cone with an angle of five milliradians; this equates to a 40-foot (12-meter) diameter circle at the weapon's design range of 4,000 feet (1,200 m).  By comparison, the M61 has an 8-milliradian dispersion.\n\nRecoil\nBecause the gun's recoil forces could push the entire plane off target during firing, the weapon is mounted laterally off-center, slightly to the port side of the fuselage centerline, with the active firing barrel lying directly on the aircraft's centerline. The firing barrel also lies just below the aircraft's center of gravity, being bore-sighted along a line 2 degrees below the aircraft's line of flight. This arrangement accurately centers the recoil forces, preventing changes in aircraft pitch or yaw when fired. This configuration also leaves space for the front landing gear, which is mounted slightly off-center on the starboard side of the nose.\nThe GAU-8\/A utilizes recoil adapters. They are the interface between the gun housing and the gun mount. By absorbing (in compression) the recoil forces, they spread the time of the recoil impulse and counter recoil energy transmitted to the supporting structure when the gun is fired.\n\nThe A-10 engines were initially susceptible to flameout when subjected to gases generated in the firing of the gun. When the GAU-8 is being fired, the smoke from the gun can make the engines stop, and this did occur during initial flight testing. Gun exhaust is essentially oxygen-free, and is capable of causing flameouts of gas turbines. The A-10 engines now have a self-sustaining combustion section. When the gun is fired, the igniters come on to reduce the possibility of a flameout.\nThe average recoil force of the GAU-8\/A is 10,000 pounds-force (45 kN), which is slightly more than the output of each of the A-10's two TF34 engines of 9,065 lbf (40.3 kN).  While this recoil force is significant, in practice a cannon-fire burst slows the aircraft by only a few miles per hour in level flight.\n\nVariants\nSome of the GAU-8\/A technology has been transferred into the smaller 25 mm GAU-12\/U Equalizer, which was developed for the AV-8B Harrier II aircraft.  The GAU-12 is about the same size as the 20 mm M61. GE has also developed the GAU-13\/A, a four-barreled weapon using GAU-8\/A components, which has been tested in podded form as the GPU-5\/A.  The Avenger also forms the basis for the Dutch-developed Goalkeeper CIWS naval air-defense gun. No current or contemplated aircraft other than the A-10 carries the full-up Avenger system.\n\nSpecifications\nPrecision: 80% of rounds fired at 4,000 feet (1,200 m) range hit within a 40-foot (12 m) diameter circle.\nAmmo:\nPGU-14\/B API Armor Piercing Incendiary (DU)\nPGU-13\/B HEI High explosive incendiary\nPGU-15\/B TP Target Practice\nArmor penetration of Armor-Piercing Incendiary ammunition, BHN-300 RHA, attack angle 30 degrees from vertical:\n76 mm at 300 meters\n69 mm at 600 m\n64 mm at 800 m\n59 mm at 1,000\u202fm\n55 mm at 1,220 m\n\nSee also\nGryazev-Shipunov GSh-6-30\nList of aircraft weapons\nList of multiple-barrel firearms\nT249 Vigilante\nType 730 CIWS\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nSpick, Michael.

One duty of the goel was to redeem (purchase back) a relative who had been sold into slavery. Another was to avenge the death of a relative who had been wrongly killed; one carrying out this vengeance was known as the goel hadam, commonly translated to English as \"avenger of blood.\"\nThe term goel is also used for other forms of redemption. In the Book of Isaiah, God is called the redeemer of Israel, as God redeems his people from captivity; the context shows that the redemption also involves moving on to something greater.\n\nDuties of the goel\nThe obligations of the goel include the duty to redeem the relative from slavery if the latter had been obliged to sell himself into slavery (Leviticus 25:48\u201349); to repurchase the property of a relative who had had to sell it because of poverty; to avenge the blood of his relative; to marry his brother's widow to have a son for his brother, in the case that the brother had no son to pass on his name (Deuteronomy 25:5\u20136); and to receive the restitution if the injured relative had died (Numbers 5:8).\nNumbers 35:9\u201330 regulates the duties of the goel hadam. The congregation must judge the case before it puts a murderer in the hands of a goel. More than one witness is needed for conviction. In case of accidental manslaughter, the slayer can save his life by fleeing to a city of refuge and staying there until the death of the High Priest of Israel. Ransom is not accepted for murder. Revenge cannot be taken on the offender's children or parents (Deuteronomy 24:16).\nLeviticus 25:48\u201349 gives the order in which the nearest relative is considered the goel in the case of redeeming a slave: brother, uncle, male cousin and then other relatives. The same order was probably observed in the other cases, except in marrying a sister-in-law.\n\nThe blood-avenger in rabbinic tradition\nJewish tradition has also attributed the blood avenger role in modern times to a prosecuting attorney, who pleads on behalf of the victim in the case against the criminal. Thus, he is responsible for bringing the offender to court, finding evidence against him, presenting the case, and collecting damages from the offender. His task is also to argue against any attempts to pardon the sinner. It is presumed that the court would be the party who would avenge the wrongful death via the imposition of the death penalty, though Deuteronomy 13:9 suggests that the witness to an offence and afterward the whole of the people would carry out the penalty of death by stoning.\n\nSee also\nNext of kin\nRedeemer (Christianity)\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nDonald A.

The Avenger will use the same ground support infrastructure as the MQ-1 and MQ-9, including the ground control station and existing communications networks.\nThe Avenger can also carry and deploy other unmanned systems to achieve stand-off survivability and achieve a penetrating capability at the same time.\n\nOperational history\nFlight testing\nThe first flight of the first prototype Avenger occurred on 4 April 2009 at the company's Grey Butte Field Airport Flight Operations Facility in Palmdale, California.  The aircraft took off and landed without any discrepancies and was ready to fly again once refueled.  Following flights were performed successfully on 13 and 14 April. The second prototype Avenger performed its first flight on 12 January 2012, meeting all performance objectives and refining the first prototype design to an operational capability.  The Tail 2 prototype featured a four-foot longer fuselage to accommodate larger payloads and more fuel.  This larger Avenger can carry a larger payload of up to 3,500 pounds (1,600 kg) of weapons internally and on its wing hard points.\nOn 15 February 2012, the Air Force cancelled its MQ-X program, which was supposed to find an aircraft to replace the MQ-9 Reaper. The Sea Avenger variant was part of the Navy's cancelled Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) program.\nOn 15 November 2012, the Avenger flew for three hours while being controlled by the General Atomics Advanced Cockpit Ground Control Station (GCS).  The Advanced Cockpit GCS has a wrap-around visual display and multi-dimensional moving map to increase situational awareness and reduce pilot workload.  The Advanced Cockpit GCS has flown an MQ-1 Predator and is planning to fly an MQ-9 Reaper as part of an Air Force initiative to enable interoperability with all USAF Remote Piloted Aircraft (RPA).\nIn July 2013, a third Avenger was scheduled to begin flight testing. Assembly of the fourth Avenger was expected to be finished by spring 2014.\nOn 27 October 2016, General Atomics flew an extended-range Avenger featuring wings extended by 3.2 m (10 ft) to 23.2 m (76 ft).  The extended wings add about 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) of fuel totaling 4,600 kg (10,100 lb), extending endurance from 15 hours to 20 hours but reducing internal payload to 3,000 lb (1,400 kg).  Since its first flight in 2009, the Avenger has completed more than 13,000 flight hours, reaching 11,000 hours in July 2016 and accumulating most of those hours within the past three years.\n\nWeapons testing\nOn November 28, 2023, an Avenger test deployed the Advanced Air-Launched Effects (A2LE) small uncrewed aerial system (sUAS) from its internal weapons bay over Dugway Proving Ground, Utah.\n\nPotential deployments\nIn December 2011, it was reported that the Air Force had ordered an Avenger and that it would be deployed to Afghanistan.  \"This aircraft will be used as a test asset and will provide a significantly increased weapons and sensors payload capacity on an aircraft that will be able to fly to targets much more rapidly than the MQ-9 [Reaper] UAS,\" the USAF said in an announcement. \"Since it has an internal weapons bay and four hardpoints on each wing it will also allow greater flexibility and will accommodate a large selection of next generation sensor and weapons payloads.\"\nThe aircraft ordered was the original Tail 1 prototype version. This announcement sparked rumors that the aircraft would be deployed to monitor neighboring Iran and Pakistan.  These allegations were made because the Avenger is stealthy, while the battlespace over Afghanistan is free of radar guided missiles, as well as any other anti-aircraft weapons.  The announcement also came two weeks after the Iran-US RQ-170 incident.  The Air Force responded by clarifying that the purchase was initiated in July of that year, well before the incident.\nHowever, the Air Force later clarified that the Avenger was being purchased only as a test asset, and that it was not being sent to Afghanistan.  Discrepancies in the solicitation are believed to have caused the misinterpretation. After testing, the Air Force decided that the Avenger version they evaluated offered only modest improvements over the MQ-9 in terms of speed, payload, and reduced signature, and didn't meet survivability and reliability requirements to survive in contested environments needed to warrant buying a new aircraft of the type.\nWith the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, the US has lost access to airbases inside the country that are necessary for striking targets in neighboring Pakistan. Due to the longer distances from potential targets, General Atomics has pitched the Avenger to the Central Intelligence Agency as a better drone for the mission.  The jet-powered Avenger can fly 1,800 mi (2,900 km) from its operating base and stay airborne for 18 hours.\n\nExport\nCanada\nGeneral Atomics has offered the Predator C Avenger to Canada as a contender for its Joint Unmanned Surveillance and Target Acquisition System (JUSTAS) armed UAV project. In 2016, the JUSTAS project was prioritized by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and Liberal government. The RCAF has requested that the drones be armed, therefore making the General Atomics Avenger the only suitable contender, as the Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk is unarmed.\nFollowing a formal Invitation to Qualify issued by the Government of Canada, only General Atomics and L3 Technologies MAS were selected as being qualified suppliers allowed to submit a bid. Canada will begin to refine the preliminary requirements with General Atomics and L3 Technologies until a formal request for proposals and contract is awarded. On February 11, 2022, the formal RFP was released to qualified suppliers with an expected contract awarded in 2024. On December 19, 2023 the Government of Canada announced the acquisition of 11  MQ-9B drones from General Atomics in $2.5 billion CAD deal.\n\nIndia\nOn 22 September 2015, the U.S. stated they backed India's membership in the Missile Technology Control Regime, which would enable them to buy armed drones.  Two days later, the Indian Air Force sent a letter to General Atomics saying it wanted to purchase the Avenger.\nAs of 17 August 2017, General Atomics Aeronautical Systems (GA-ASI) is in the early stages of negotiating the potential sale of as many as 100 Predator C Avenger remotely piloted aircraft to an unidentified international customer. The renewed international interest is believed to be led by India, which has requested access to the capability as a potential follow-on to the planned acquisition of as many as 20 GA-ASI MQ-9 UAVs, 10 each for its Army and Navy and wants to acquire 100 Avenger drones for its Air Force at the cost of $8 billion.\n\nVariants\nMQ-20\nUS military designation for the Avenger\n\nSea Avenger\nOn 3 May 2010, GA-ASI introduced Sea Avenger, a carrier-based derivative of the Predator C Avenger UAS, intended to fulfill the U.S. Navy's need for an Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS). The Sea Avenger included a retractable electro-optical\/infrared sensor, internal weapons bay, and folding wings. The aircraft's structure was designed with the flexibility to accommodate carrier suitable landing gear, tailhook, drag devices, and other provisions for carrier operations.\nIn April 2014, General Atomics displayed images of the Sea Avenger at the Navy League Sea Air and Space exposition.  As requirements for the UCLASS program were altered from a high-end strike aircraft to an ISR machine operating in permissive environments, the Sea Avenger was modified accordingly.  It appeared to have four external hardpoints and a small weapons bay, a wing-mounted buddy-refueling store to perform as an aerial tanker, and a larger airframe with a larger engine.\nIf Navy requirements favored a UAV optimized for permissive ISR over broadband stealth, the Sea Avenger would better meet them, as it was originally pitched as having a reduced signature to be \"stealthier\" than other aircraft.  Sea Avenger stealth capabilities seemed to be limited to higher frequencies like C, X, and Ku bands, instead of broadband stealth effective against low-frequency radar bands like VHF and UHF.\nIn October 2017, General Atomics released images of its submission for the Navy's MQ-25 Stingray, an unmanned aerial tanker that formed out of the UCLASS effort. The aircraft is an Avenger-based wing-body-tail design with a standard D-704 buddy tank refueling system that has an electro-optical ball like the Predator and Reaper, landing gear that pulls into the fuselage, and a system for maneuvering around the flight deck using gestures from the flight crew. Though specifics are not known, the basic requirements will have the Stingray deliver about 15,000 lb (6,800 kg) of fuel 500 nautical miles (580 mi; 930 km) from the aircraft carrier to increase the F\/A-18 Super Hornet's combat radius from 450 to 700 nmi (520 to 810 mi; 830 to 1,300 km).\nGA-ASI's design is larger than the Sea Avenger and is powered by the Pratt & Whitney PW815 high-bypass turbofan, the same engine used on the Gulfstream G600. Generating 16,000 lb (7,300 kg) of thrust, it is four times more powerful than the Predator C's PW545B turbofan, and the most powerful engine used by any Stingray competitor. In addition to structural reinforcements and additional systems for carrier operations, the aircraft is fitted with the same landing gear and arresting hook as the Super Hornet and has space available for future growth to perform ISR and strike missions; it would be able to fuel four to six aircraft.\nThe MQ-25 contract was awarded to Boeing in August 2018.\n\nAvenger ER\nOn 27 October 2016, General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. (GA-ASI) conducted the maiden flight of the Avenger ER. GA-ASI extended the wingspan of the Avenger ER by 3.2 m (10 ft) to 23.2 m (76 ft), and enlarged its fuel capacity by 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) to 4,600 kg (10,100 lb) compared to previous specifications. The aircraft carries up to 1,360 kg (3,000 lb) in its internal payload bay, 227 kg (500 lb) less than previously described.\nThe modifications extend its endurance from the original 15 hours to 20 hours. The Avenger ER uses a modified fuselage design (completed in 2012) extended by four feet (to 13.4 m (44 ft)) to accommodate larger payloads and more fuel. Earlier in 2016, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration granted GA-ASI an experimental certificate that allows it to fly the Avenger in the National Airspace System.\nFrom 24 to 25 January 2018, an Avenger ER set a new endurance record of 23.4 continuous hours, exceeding the 20 hour flight test goal and reflecting a 10-hour improvement over the baseline Predator C Avenger. The Avenger ER also has an increased maximum gross takeoff weight (MGTOW) of 19,500 lb (8,800 kg) using a co-cured composite center wing and heavyweight landing gear as well as a dual redundant, light weight brake control capability using a lightweight hybrid linear anti-lock brake system.\n\nOperators\nUnited States\nUnited States Air Force - one aircraft\nUnidentified U.S. government customer \u2013 up to seven aircraft\n\nSpecifications\nData from General characteristics\nCrew: 2 (ground control)\nLength: 44 ft 0 in (13 m)\nWingspan: 66 ft 0 in (20 m) sweep angle 17\u00b0\nMax takeoff weight: 18,200 lb (8,255 kg)\nFuel capacity: 7,900 pounds (3,600 kg)\nPowerplant: 1 \u00d7 Pratt & Whitney Canada PW545B turbofan, 3,991 lbf (17.75 kN) thrust\nPerformance\n\nMaximum speed: 460 mph (740 km\/h, 400 kn)\nCruise speed: 402 mph (648 km\/h, 350 kn)\nEndurance: 18 hours\nService ceiling: 50,000 ft (15,240 m)\nArmament\nInternal weapons bay with 3,500 pounds (1,600 kg) capacity.  6 external hardpoints.  6,500 pounds (2,900 kg) payload total.\n\nMissiles\nAGM-114 Hellfire\nBombs\nGBU-39 SDB \u2013 250 lb (110 kg) bombs\nGBU-12 Paveway II, GBU-38 JDAM \u2013 500 lb (230 kg) bombs\nGBU-16 Paveway II, GBU-32 JDAM \u2013 1,000 lb (450 kg) bombs\nGBU-31 JDAM \u2013 2,000 lb (910 kg) bombs\nOther\nLegion IRST Pod\nAvionics\n\nLynx synthetic aperture radar\nAESA wide-area surveillance sensor\n\nSee also\nRelated development\n\nGeneral Atomics MQ-1 Predator\nGeneral Atomics MQ-1C Gray Eagle\nGeneral Atomics MQ-9 Reaper\nAircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era\n\nGuizhou WZ-7 Soaring Dragon\nChengdu WZ-10\nEADS Barracuda\nKratos XQ-58 Valkyrie\nScaled Composites 401\nS-70 Okhotnik\nDRDO Ghatak\nShahed Saegheh\n\nRelated lists\n\nList of unmanned aerial vehicles\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nPredator C Avenger Makes First Flights\nPhoto: Avenger UAV\nAvenger UAV, GA-ASI.com\nAvenger \u2013 A Stealthy Predator C Combat UAV from General Atomics","52":"The Grumman TBF Avenger (designated TBM for aircraft manufactured by General Motors) is an American World War II-era torpedo bomber developed initially for the United States Navy and Marine Corps, and eventually used by several air and naval aviation services around the world.\nThe Avenger entered U.S. service in 1942, and first saw action during the Battle of Midway. Despite the loss of five of the six Avengers on its combat debut, it survived in service to become the most effective submarine killer and most widely-used torpedo bomber of World War II, sharing credit for sinking the super-battleships Yamato and Musashi  and being credited for sinking 30 submarines. Greatly modified after the war, it remained in use until the 1960s.\n\nDesign and development\nThe Douglas TBD Devastator, the U.S. Navy's main torpedo bomber introduced in 1935, was obsolete by 1939. Bids were accepted from several companies, but Grumman's TBF design was selected as the replacement for the TBD and in April 1940 two prototypes were ordered by the Navy. Designed by Leroy Grumman, the first prototype was called the XTBF-1. It was first flown on 7 August 1941. Although one of the first two prototypes crashed near Brentwood, New York, rapid production continued.\nTo ease carrier storage concerns, simultaneously with the F4F-4 model of its Wildcat carrier fighter, Grumman designed the Avenger to also use the new Sto-Wing patented \"compound angle\" wing-folding mechanism, intended to maximize storage space on an aircraft carrier; the Wildcat's replacement, the F6F Hellcat, also employed this mechanism. The engine used was the twin-row Wright R-2600-20 Twin Cyclone fourteen-cylinder radial engine, which produced 1,900 horsepower (1,420 kW).\nThere were three crew members: pilot, turret gunner and radioman\/bombardier\/ventral gunner. A single synchronized .30 caliber (7.62 mm) machine gun was mounted in the nose, a .50 caliber (12.7 mm) gun was mounted right next to the turret gunner's head in a rear-facing electrically powered turret, and a single 0.30 caliber (7.62 mm) hand-fired machine gun flexibly-mounted ventrally (under the tail), which was used to defend against enemy fighters attacking from below and to the rear. This gun was fired by the radioman\/bombardier while standing up and bending over in the belly of the tail section, though he usually sat on a folding bench facing forward to operate the radio and to sight in bombing runs. Later models of the TBF\/TBM omitted the cowl-mount synchronized 0.30 caliber (7.62 mm) gun, and replaced it with twin Browning AN\/M2 0.50 caliber (12.7 mm) light-barrel guns, one in each wing outboard of the propeller arc, per pilots' requests for better forward firepower and increased strafing ability. There was only one set of controls on the aircraft, and no direct access to the pilot's position existed from the rest of the aircraft's interior. The radio equipment was massive, especially by today's standards, and filled the length of the well-framed \"greenhouse\" canopy to the rear of the pilot. The radios were accessible for repair through a \"tunnel\" along the right hand side. Any Avengers that are still flying today usually have an additional rear-mounted seat in place of the radios, allowing for a fourth passenger.\nThe Avenger had a large bomb bay, allowing for one Bliss-Leavitt Mark 13 torpedo, a single 2,000-pound (907 kg) bomb, or up to four 500-pound (227 kg) bombs. The aircraft had overall ruggedness and stability, and pilots say it flew like a truck, for better or worse. With its good radio facilities, docile handling, and long range, the Grumman Avenger also made an ideal command aircraft for Commanders, Air Group (CAGs). With a 30,000 ft (9,000 m) ceiling and a fully loaded range of 1,000 miles (1,600 km), it was better than any previous American torpedo bomber, and better than its Japanese counterpart, the obsolete Nakajima B5N \"Kate\". Later Avenger models carried radar equipment for the ASW and AEW roles.\nEscort carrier sailors referred to the TBF as the \"turkey\" because of its size and maneuverability in comparison to the F4F Wildcat fighters in the same airgroups.\n\nOperational history\nU.S. Navy\nOn the afternoon of 7 December 1941, Grumman held a ceremony to open a new manufacturing plant and display the new TBF to the public. Coincidentally, on that day, the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked Pearl Harbor, as Grumman soon found out. After the ceremony was over, the plant was quickly sealed off to guard against possible sabotage. By early June 1942, a shipment of more than 100 aircraft was sent to the Navy, arriving only a few hours after the three carriers quickly departed from Pearl Harbor, so most of them were too late to participate in the pivotal Battle of Midway.\nSix TBF-1s were present on Midway Island \u2013 as part of VT-8 (Torpedo Squadron 8) \u2013 while the rest of the squadron flew Devastators from the aircraft carrier Hornet. Both types of torpedo bombers suffered heavy casualties. Out of the six Avengers, five were shot down and the other returned heavily damaged with one of its gunners killed, and the other gunner and the pilot wounded.\nAuthor Gordon Prange posited in Miracle at Midway that the outdated Devastators (and lack of new aircraft) contributed somewhat to the lack of a complete victory at Midway (the four Japanese fleet carriers were sunk directly by dive bombers instead). Others pointed out that the inexperienced American pilots and lack of fighter cover were responsible for poor showing of US torpedo bombers, regardless of type. Later in the war, with growing American air superiority, better attack coordination and more veteran pilots, Avengers were able to play vital roles in the subsequent battles against Japanese surface forces.\nOn 24 August 1942, the next major naval aircraft carrier battle occurred at the Eastern Solomons. Based on the carriers Saratoga and Enterprise, the 24 TBFs present were able to sink the Japanese light carrier Ry\u016bj\u014d and claim one dive bomber, at the cost of seven aircraft.\nThe first major \"prize\" for the TBFs (which had been assigned the name \"Avenger\" in October 1941, before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor) was at the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal in November 1942, when Marine Corps and Navy Avengers helped sink the Japanese battleship Hiei, which had already been crippled the night before.\nAfter hundreds of the original TBF-1 models were built, the TBF-1C began production. The allotment of space for specialized internal and wing-mounted fuel tanks doubled the Avenger's range. By 1943, Grumman began to slowly phase out production of the Avenger to produce F6F Hellcat fighters, and the Eastern Aircraft Division of General Motors took over production, with these aircraft being designated TBM. The Eastern Aircraft plant was located in Ewing, New Jersey. Grumman delivered a TBF-1, held together with sheet metal screws, so that the automotive engineers could disassemble it, one part at a time, and redesign the aircraft for automotive-style production. This aircraft was known as the \"P-K Avenger\" (\"P-K\" being an abbreviation for Parker-Kalon, manufacturer of sheet metal screws). Starting in mid-1944, the TBM-3 began production (with a more powerful powerplant and wing hardpoints for drop tanks and rockets). The dash-3 was the most numerous of the Avengers (with about 4,600 produced). However, most of the Avengers in service were dash-1s until near the end of the war in 1945.\nBesides the traditional surface role (torpedoing surface ships), Avengers claimed about 30 submarine kills, including the cargo submarine I-52. They were one of the most effective sub-killers in the Pacific theater, as well as in the Atlantic, when escort carriers were finally available to escort Allied convoys. There, the Avengers contributed to the warding off of German U-boats while providing air cover for the convoys.\nAfter the \"Marianas Turkey Shoot\", in which more than 250 Japanese aircraft were downed, Admiral Marc Mitscher ordered a 220-aircraft mission to find the Japanese task force. Fighting 300 nmi (560 km) away from the fleet at the extreme end of their range, the group of Hellcats, TBF\/TBMs, and dive bombers took many casualties. However, Avengers from the Independence-class aircraft carrier USS Belleau Wood sank the light carrier Hiy\u014d as their only major prize. Mitscher's gamble did not pay off as well as he had hoped.\nIn June 1943, shortly before his 19th birthday, future-president, George H. W. Bush, was commissioned as the youngest naval aviator at the time. Later, while flying a TBM with VT-51 (from USS San Jacinto), his Avenger was shot down on 2 September 1944 over the Pacific island of Chichi Jima. However, he released his payload and hit the radio tower target before being forced to bail out over water. Both of his crewmates died. He was rescued at sea by the American submarine USS Finback. He later received the Distinguished Flying Cross.\nAnother famous Avenger aviator was Paul Newman, who flew as a rear gunner. He had hoped to be accepted for pilot training, but did not qualify because he was color blind. Newman was on board the escort carrier USS Hollandia roughly 500 mi (800 km) from Japan when the Enola Gay dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima.\nThe Avenger was the type of torpedo bomber used during the sinking of the two Japanese \"super battleships\", with the US Navy having complete air superiority in both engagements: Musashi and Yamato.\nThe postwar disappearance on 5 December 1945 of a flight of five American Avengers, known as Flight 19, was later added to the Bermuda Triangle legend, first written about by Edward Van Winkle Jones in an Associated Press article published in September 1950.\nDuring World War II, the US aeronautical research arm NACA used a complete Avenger in a comprehensive drag-reduction study in their large Langley wind tunnel.\n\nRoyal Navy\nThe Avenger was also used by the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm, where it was initially known as the \"Tarpon\". Initial test flights were carried out by British Admiralty test pilot Roy Sydney Baker-Falkner at RAF Boscombe Down. However, this name was later discontinued and the Avenger name used instead, as part of the process of the Fleet Air Arm universally adopting the U.S. Navy's names for American naval aircraft. The first 402 aircraft were known as Avenger Mk I, 334 TBM-1s from Grumman were called the Avenger Mk II, and 334 TBM-3 were designated the Mk III. An interesting kill by a Royal Navy Avenger was the destruction of a V-1 flying bomb on 9 July 1944. The much faster V-1 was overtaking the Avenger when the Telegraphist Air Gunner in the dorsal turret, Leading Airman Fred Shirmer, fired at it from 700 yards (640 m). For this achievement, Shirmer was Mentioned in Dispatches, later being awarded the DSM for the 1945 Operation Meridian action at Palembang. In the January 1945 British carrier raid on the Soengei Gerong oil refinery during Operation Meridian, a Fleet Air Arm Avenger shot down a Nakajima Ki-44 \"Tojo\" in low level combat over the jungle. Three Avengers were modified to carry the Highball \"bouncing bomb\" (given the new codename Tammany Hall), but when trials were unsuccessful, they were returned to standard configuration and passed to the Royal Navy.\nOne hundred USN TBM-3Es were supplied to the Fleet Air Arm in 1953 under the US Mutual Defense Assistance Program. The aircraft were shipped from Norfolk, Virginia, many aboard the Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS Perseus. The Avengers were fitted with British equipment by Scottish Aviation and delivered as the Avenger AS.4 to several FAA squadrons including No. 767, 814, 815, 820 and 824. The aircraft were replaced from 1954 by Fairey Gannets and were passed to squadrons of the Royal Naval Reserve including No. 1841 and 1844 until the RNR Air Branch was disbanded in 1957. The survivors were transferred to the French Navy in 1957\u20131958.\n\nRoyal New Zealand Air Force\nThe only other operator in World War II was the Royal New Zealand Air Force which used the type primarily as a bomber, equipping Nos. 30 and 31 Squadrons, with both operating from South Pacific island bases during 1944 in support of the Bougainville campaign. Some of the Avengers were later transferred to the British Pacific Fleet.\nIn 1945, Avengers were involved in pioneering trials of aerial topdressing in New Zealand that led to the establishment of an industry which markedly increased food production and efficiency in farming worldwide. Pilots of the Royal New Zealand Air Force's No. 42 Squadron spread fertilizer from Avengers beside runways at Ohakea Air Base and provided a demonstration for farmers at Hood Aerodrome, Masterton, New Zealand.\n\nRoyal Canadian Navy\nOne of the primary postwar users of the Avenger was the Royal Canadian Navy, which obtained 125 former US Navy TBM-3E Avengers from 1950 to 1952 to replace their venerable Fairey Fireflies. By the time the Avengers were delivered, the RCN was shifting its primary focus to anti-submarine warfare (ASW), and the aircraft was rapidly becoming obsolete as an attack platform. Consequently, 98 of the RCN Avengers were fitted with an extensive number of novel ASW modifications, including radar, electronic countermeasures (ECM) equipment, and sonobuoys, and the upper ball turret was replaced with a sloping glass canopy that was better suited for observation duties. The modified Avengers were designated AS 3. A number of these aircraft were later fitted with a large magnetic anomaly detector (MAD) boom on the rear left side of the fuselage and were redesignated AS 3M. However, RCN leaders soon realized the Avenger's shortcomings as an ASW aircraft, and in 1954 they elected to replace the AS 3 with the Grumman S-2 Tracker, which offered longer range, greater load-carrying capacity for electronics and armament, and a second engine, a great safety benefit when flying long-range ASW patrols over frigid North Atlantic waters. As delivery of the new license-built CS2F Trackers began in 1957, the Avengers were shifted to training duties, and were officially retired in July 1960.\n\nCamouflage research\nTBM Avengers were used in wartime research into counter-illumination camouflage. The torpedo bombers were fitted with Yehudi lights, a set of forward-pointing lights automatically adjusted to match the brightness of the sky. The planes therefore appeared as bright as the sky, rather than as dark shapes. The technology, a development of the Canadian navy's diffused lighting camouflage research, allowed an Avenger to advance to within 3,000 yards (2,700 m) before being seen.\n\nCivilian use\nMany Avengers have survived into the 21st century working as spray-applicators and water-bombers throughout North America, particularly in the Canadian province of New Brunswick.\nForest Protection Limited (FPL) of Fredericton, New Brunswick, once owned and operated the largest civilian fleet of Avengers in the world. FPL began operating Avengers in 1958 after purchasing 12 surplus TBM-3E aircraft from the Royal Canadian Navy. Use of the Avenger fleet at FPL peaked in 1971 when 43 aircraft were in use as both water bombers and spray aircraft. The company sold three Avengers in 2004 (C-GFPS, C-GFPM, and C-GLEJ) to museums or private collectors. The Central New Brunswick Woodsmen's Museum has a former FPL Avenger on static display. An FPL Avenger that crashed in 1975 in southwestern New Brunswick was recovered and restored by a group of interested aviation enthusiasts and is currently on display at the Atlantic Canada Aviation Museum. FPL was still operating three Avengers in 2010 configured as water-bombers, and stationed at Miramichi Airport. One of these crashed just after takeoff on 23 April 2010, killing the pilot. The last FPL Avenger was retired on 26 July 2012 and sold to the Shearwater Aviation Museum in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.\nThere are several other Avengers, usually flying as warbirds in private collections around the world today. They are a popular airshow fixture in both flying and static displays.\nIn 2020 the Commemorative Air Force (CAF) were flying three TBM Avengers with one based with the Rocky Mountain Wing in Grand Junction, Colorado; another with the Missouri Wing at St Charles Smartt Field; and their newest with the Capital Wing in Culpeper, Virginia. Each of these allow non-CAF members to ride in the aircraft for a Living History Flight Experience.\n\nVariants\nTBF\nXTBF-1\nPrototypes each powered by a 1,700 hp (1,300 kW) R-2600-8 engine, second aircraft introduced the large dorsal fin.

The first season of Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law is the first adult animated production to be produced by Cartoon Network Studios. A spin-off of Space Ghost Coast to Coast, the series revolves around Harvey Birdman, originally a superhero from Birdman and the Galaxy Trio, and his new career as an attorney, defending characters who had originally been featured in past Hanna-Barbera cartoons.\nThe pilot first aired as a sneak peek on Cartoon Network on December 30, 2000. The series officially premiered on Adult Swim on September 2, 2001, the night the block launched. It ended on July 22, 2007, with a total of 39 episodes, over the course of four seasons. The entire series has been made available on DVD, and other forms of home media, including on-demand streaming. A special, entitled Harvey Birdman: Attorney General, premiered on October 15, 2018, and a spin-off, Birdgirl, premiered on April 4, 2021.\n\nPremise\nHarvey Birdman, Attorney at Law features ex-superhero Harvey Birdman of Birdman and the Galaxy Trio as an attorney working for a law firm alongside other cartoon stars from the 1960s and 1970s Hanna-Barbera cartoon series. Harvey's clients are also primarily characters taken from the Hanna-Barbera cartoon series of the same era.\nMany of Birdman's nemeses from his former cartoon series appear as attorneys, often representing the opposing side of a given case. Harvey usually fills the role of a criminal defense attorney, though he will act as a civil litigator or other similar roles when the plot calls for it.\nThe series uses a surrealist style of comedy, featuring characters, objects, and jokes that are briefly introduced and rarely (if ever) referenced thereafter. Because the series relies heavily on popular culture references to classic television animation, Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law constantly delves into parody, featuring clips of these series or specially created scenes which mimic the distinctive style of the animation being referenced.\nHarvey Birdman, Attorney at Law is the first Williams Street cartoon to maintain continuity through the entire series. Various episodes reference Harvey's (or another superhero's) former crime-fighting career. The episode \"Turner Classic Birdman\" serves to bridge the gap between Birdman and the Galaxy Trio and Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law.\nMuch of the humor is derived from giving superheroes and supervillains more eccentric qualities, such as transforming mad scientist Dr. Myron Reducto into a paranoid prosecutor. Several of the plots revolve around popular myths about classic Hanna-Barbera characters, such as Shaggy and Scooby-Doo being recreational drug users.\n\nVoice cast\nGary Cole as Harvey Birdman, Judge Hiram Mightor\nStephen Colbert as Phil Ken Sebben, Myron Reducto\nThomas Michael Allen as Peanut\nPaget Brewster as Judy Ken Sebben\/Birdgirl\nChris Edgerly as Peter Potamus\nJohn Michael Higgins as Mentok the Mindtaker\nPeter MacNicol as X the Eliminator\n\nEpisodes\nProduction\nHarvey Birdman, Attorney at Law creators Michael Ouweleen and Erik Richter were originally writers for Space Ghost Coast to Coast, which is where the titular character made his debut. The show was Adult Swim's most expensive original series at the time, and is the most expensive spin-off of Space Ghost Coast to Coast.\nAlthough the first season was animated using digital ink and paint, the remaining seasons were animated using Adobe After Effects. The reason for the switch was that the animation studio was having difficulty maintaining the fast pace of the show, and thus the production of episodes slowed down due to constant retakes.\nBy animating the later episodes at Turner Studios in Atlanta with Adobe Flash, not only were problems corrected more quickly, but production costs were much lower.\n\nInternational broadcast\nIn Canada, Harvey Birdman, Attorney At Law previously aired on Teletoon's Teletoon at Night block and later G4's Adult Digital Distraction block. The series currently airs on the Canadian version of Adult Swim.\n\nReception\nIn 2009, Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law was named the 91st-best animated series by IGN. They called the concept of the show \"wonderful\" and the show as a whole \"especially clever.\" The review summarized that \"Harvey Birdman worked as both a parody and homage to these animated characters we know and love, with plenty of funny, surreal jokes along the way.\"\n\nHome media\nEach DVD is in the shape of a law book. Each season's box art is nearly identical; the only change for each season is the background colour (Volume One is brown purple, Volume Two is blue, and Volume Three is black). The small picture next to the title and the title itself also appears different. In April 2005, Adult Swim had a \"Do Our Work For Us\" contest for Harvey Birdman Season 1 on DVD. The objective of the contest was to ask viewers to make their own fan-made promo commercial for the then-upcoming DVD.\nThe series is also available on Max.\n\nMusic\nThe theme song is an edited version of the song \"Slow Moody Blues\" written by Reg Tilsley. Other notable songs used in the show include Charlie Steinman's \"It Is Such a Good Night\" (also known as \"Scoobidoo Love\") and a lyricless version of Gianni Morandi's \"La Mia Mania\" (also known as \"Okay Maria\").\n\nOther media\nVideo game\nA video game based on the series has been released for the PlayStation 2, Wii and PlayStation Portable video game consoles. It was developed by High Voltage Software and published by Capcom, with gameplay mechanics similar to Capcom's Ace Attorney series. It was released on January 8, 2008, and includes five new, interactive cases.\n\nSpecial\nOn May 14, 2018, it was announced that there would be an upcoming special based on the series entitled Harvey Birdman: Attorney General. In the special, Harvey Birdman becomes the next Attorney General of the United States, under President Phil Ken Sebben. The original voice cast returned for the special. It premiered at midnight on October 15, 2018.\n\nSpin-off\nOn May 9, 2019, a spin-off entitled Birdgirl was announced, following Judy Ken Sebben\/Birdgirl in her new role as the CEO of Sebben & Sebben. It premiered on April 4, 2021, with a second season premiering June 19, 2022.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nOnline Channel Australia\nHarvey Birdman, Attorney at Law at IMDb\nIGN's 10 Questions: Harvey Birdman\nIGN's review of the DVD set, Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law, Volume 1","56":"The Hillman Avenger is a rear-wheel drive small family car originally manufactured by the former Rootes division of Chrysler Europe from 1970\u20131978, badged from 1976 onward as the Chrysler Avenger. Between 1979 and 1981 it was manufactured by PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn and badged as the Talbot Avenger. The Avenger was marketed in North America as the Plymouth Cricket and was the first Plymouth to have a four-cylinder engine since the 1932 Plymouth Model PB was discontinued.\nThe Avenger was initially produced at Rootes' plant in Ryton-on-Dunsmore, England, and later at the company's Linwood facility near Glasgow, Scotland.\n\n1970: Hillman Avenger\nIntroduced in February 1970, the Avenger was significant as it was the first and last car to be developed by Rootes after the Chrysler takeover in 1967. Stylistically, the Avenger was undoubtedly very much in tune with its time; the American-influenced \"Coke Bottle\" waistline and semi-fastback rear-end being a contemporary styling cue, indeed the Avenger would be the first British car to be manufactured with a one piece plastic front grille. It was similar in appearance to the larger Ford Cortina#TC Mark III (1970\u20131976), which was launched later in 1970.\nHowever, from an engineering perspective it was rather conventional, using a 4-cylinder all-iron overhead valve engine in 1250 or 1500 capacities driving a coil spring suspended live axle at the rear wheels. Unlike any previous Rootes design, there were no \"badge-engineered\" Humber or Singer versions in the UK market. The Avenger was immediately highly praised by the press for its good handling characteristics and generally good overall competence on the road and it was considered a significantly better car to drive than contemporaries like the Morris Marina.\n\nInitially, the Avenger was available as a four-door saloon in DL, Super and GL trim levels. The DL and Super could be had with either the 1250 or 1500 cc engines, but the GL was only available with the 1500 cc engine. Since the DL was the basic model in the range, it featured little more than rubber mats and a very simple dashboard with a strip-style speedometer. The Super was a bit better equipped, featuring carpets, armrests, twin horns and reversing lights, though the dashboard was carried over from the DL. The top-spec GL model featured four round headlights (which was a big improvement over the new size of almost-square rectangular ones later fitted to the Hillman Hunter that were used on the DL and Super), internal bonnet release, two-speed wipers, brushed nylon seat trim (previously never used on British cars), reclining front seats, and a round-dial dashboard with extra instrumentation.\nNot only was the Avenger's styling totally new, but so were the engine and transmission units, which were not at all like those used in the larger \"Arrow\" series Hunter. Another novelty for the Avenger was the use of a plastic radiator grille, a first in Britain and at 4 ft 6 in (137 cm) wide claimed as the largest mass-produced plastics component used at this time by the European motor industry. The Avenger was a steady seller in the 1970s, in competition with the Ford Escort and Vauxhall Viva. Chrysler was attempting to make the Avenger to be a \"world car\", and took the ambitious step of marketing the Avenger as the Plymouth Cricket in the U.S. Complaints of rust, unreliability, plus the general unpopularity of smaller cars on the American market, saw it withdrawn from that market after only two years.\n\nIntroduction of body and trim variations\nIn October 1970, the Avenger GT was added to the range. It had a twin-carburettor 1500 cc engine, four-speed manual or three-speed automatic transmission (also optional on the 1500 DL, Super and GL). The GT featured twin round headlights, go-faster stripes along the sides of the doors and \"dustbin lid\" wheel covers, which were similar to those found on the various Datsuns and Toyotas of the 1970s.\nThe basic fleet Avenger was added to the range in February 1972. It was offered with either 1250 or 1500 cc engines (the latter available with the automatic transmission option). The fleet Avenger was very basic: it did not have a sun visor for the front passenger, and the heater blower had just a single speed. In October 1972, the Avenger GT was replaced by the Avenger GLS, which came with a vinyl roof and Rostyle sports wheels.\nIn March 1972, the five-door estate versions were introduced, in DL and Super forms (both available with either 1250 or 1500 cc engines) and basically the same specifications as the saloon versions. However, 'heavy-duty springing' was fitted and the estate had a maximum load capacity of 1,040 lb (470 kg), compared to 840 lb (380 kg) for the saloon.\n\nThe two-door saloon models were added in March 1973, with all engine and trim options of the existing four-door range. Styling of the two-door was similar to the four-door, but the side profile was less curvaceous.\nThe car was extensively marketed in continental Europe, first as a Sunbeam. It was without the Avenger name in France, where it was known as the Sunbeam 1250 and 1500; later the 1300 and 1600. Some northern European markets received the car as the Sunbeam Avenger.\nBoth engine sizes were upgraded in October 1973. The 1250 became the 1300, while the 1500 became the 1600 with nearly all the same previous trim levels except for the basic fleet Avenger, which was discontinued at this point. The automatic option went from three speed to four speeds with the Borg Warner 45 transmission replacing the earlier 35. The GL and GT trim levels were now also offered with the 1300 engine and two-door saloon body.\n\n1971\u20131973: Plymouth Cricket for North America\nIn North America, a rebadged variant of the Avenger was marketed as the Plymouth Cricket through Plymouth dealers as a captive import in 4-door saloon and 5-door station wagon variants. It had 9.5\" front disc brakes and 8\" rear drums. Brochures included a cartoon cricket, possibly trying to capitalize on the popularity of the VW Beetle.\nA Chrysler Plymouth press release dated 30 June 1970 said the Cricket would be presented to the automotive press in November 1970. The first shipment of 280 Crickets from the UK arrived in the U.S. on 20 November 1970. Another press release issued on 23 February 1972 stated that the station wagon version would debut in early spring of 1972.\nThe 1500 cc engine was offered on the Plymouth Cricket. Side marker lamps (US DOT required) were added, and front disc brakes were standardized; these were originally optional in the UK. The single carburetor \/ manual choke combination was standard. From 1972, the single carburetor \/ automatic choke combination, dual carburettors, and air conditioning were all options.\nIn both the USA and Canada, federal motor vehicle safety standards required the round four-headlight grille of the GL and GT model Avengers.\nThe Cricket was discontinued during the 1973 model year despite a sharp increase in demand for small cars in North America brought on by the gas crisis of 1973. The success of the similarly-sized Dodge Colt captive import, built by Mitsubishi Motors, doomed the Cricket. With the Colt selling much better than the Cricket, re-engineering the Cricket to meet new 1974 U.S. safety and emissions standards did not make financial sense. The last Crickets were exported to the U.S. in late 1972 but were sold as 1973 models, as U.S. safety and emission laws were applied according to the calendar year when a car was manufactured or imported, as opposed to the model year when it was sold.\nA total of 27,682 Plymouth Crickets were sold in the U.S. During the same time period, the competing Ford Pinto and Chevrolet Vega each outsold the Cricket by a margin exceeding 10:1.\nThe Cricket nameplate continued in Canada, when Chrysler Canada replaced the British-built Plymouth Cricket with a rebadged Dodge Colt in mid-1973 model year. The Cricket's version of the Colt GT was called the Cricket Formula S. For the 1975 model year, the Plymouth Cricket was rebadged as the Plymouth Colt. Thus began Chrysler Canada's dual marketing system for this car, selling the Colt as both a Dodge and a Plymouth. The later Plymouth Arrow was similarly sold as a Dodge Arrow.\n\n1972: Hillman Avenger Tiger\nNamed to evoke memories of the Sunbeam Tiger, the Avenger Tiger concept began as a publicity exercise. Avenger Super (four-door) cars were modified by the Chrysler Competitions Centre under Des O'Dell and the Tiger model was launched in March 1972. Modifications included the 1500 GT engine with an improved cylinder head with enlarged valves, twin Weber carburetors and a compression ratio of 9.4:1. The engine now developed 92.5 bhp (69 kW) at 6,100 rpm. The suspension was also uprated, whilst brakes, rear axle, and gearbox are directly from the GT.\nA distinctive yellow colour scheme (\"Sundance\") with a bonnet bulge, rear spoiler and side stripes was standard, set off with \"Avenger Tiger\" lettering on the rear quarters.\nRoad test figures demonstrated a 0\u201360 mph time of 8.9 seconds and a top speed of 108 mph (174 km\/h). These figures beat the rival Ford Escort Mexico, but fuel consumption was heavy. Even in 1972, the Tiger developed a reputation for its thirst.\nAll Avenger Tigers were assembled by the Chrysler Competitions Centre and production figures are vague but around 200 of the initial Mark 1 seems likely.\nIn October 1972, Chrysler unveiled the more \"productionised\" Mark 2 Tiger. The Avenger GL bodyshell with four round headlights was used. Mechanically identical to the earlier cars(from contemporary road tests, however,there were better performances and fuel consumption), the bonnet bulge was lost although the bonnet turned matt black, and there were changes to wheels and seats. These cars went on sale at \u00a31,350. Production was around 400. Red (\"Wardance\") was now available as well as yellow (\"Sundance\"), both with black detailing.\n\n1976\u20131979: Chrysler Avenger\nIn September 1976, the Avenger was rebadged as a Chrysler. It also gained a comprehensive facelift which included a new frontal treatment and a new dashboard. Both treatments looked similar to those of the Chrysler Alpine. The greatest change was at the rear where, on the saloons, the distinctive \"hockey-stick\" rear lamp clusters were dropped in favour of a straight \"light-bar\" arrangement. The top of the former \"hockey-sticks\" had metal plates in their place, whilst the fuel cap was moved from the rear to the right hand side of the car.\nThree trim levels were available, LS, GL (known as 'Super' in certain markets) and GLS\u2014the GLS being only available in a high-compression 1.6 L form.\nFrom the beginning of production in 1970, the Avenger's bodyshell components had been manufactured at Linwood, and then transported south to Ryton on the component trains used to move materials for the Hillman Imp north to Linwood.  Following the Imp's discontinuation in 1976, the Avenger production line was moved from Ryton to Linwood where it was produced until the end of its UK production life., whilst Ryton was switched over to producing the Simca-based Chrysler Alpine and later the Talbot Solara.\n\n1979\u20131981: Talbot Avenger\nFollowing the collapse of Chrysler Europe in 1978, and its takeover by PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, the Avenger was re-badged with the resurrected Talbot brand with the Avenger remaining in production alongside the hatchback-only Horizon to meet the demand which remained for traditional saloons and estates in this sector. Unlike newer Talbot models such as the Horizon, the Avenger and Sunbeam retained the Chrysler \"Pentastar\" badge, instead of the Talbot logo featuring a letter \"T\" inside a circle \u2013 this was because Chrysler had retained the rights to the Avenger and Sunbeam models after the sale of Chrysler Europe to PSA, who only had purchased the rights to the Simca-based Alpine and Horizon. Production continued until the middle of 1981, when PSA closed the Linwood production plant and concentrated all British production at the Ryton plant. The Avenger was discontinued with no direct replacement \u2013 the Peugeot 305, introduced in 1977, was the closest car to the Avenger's size in PSA's lineup; although the slightly larger Talbot Solara (a saloon version of the Alpine\/Simca 1307) had been introduced shortly before the Avenger's demise.\nChrysler retained ownership of the \"Avenger\" trademark, subsequently used on the Dodge Avenger 2007\u20132014.  The name was also used on Jeep's first electric model to be marketed in Australia in 2024\n\nInternational production\nChrysler's operations in various countries around the world also marketed (and in some cases assembled) the car. In South Africa, the car\u2014like the larger Hunter assembled there\u2014used Peugeot engines and was badged as a Dodge rather than a Hillman, while in New Zealand the car, assembled from CKD kits by importer Todd Motors (later Mitsubishi Motors NZ), was available initially in 4-door and, later, 5-door estate forms.\n\nDenmark and Europe\nIn Denmark, the versions being sold were:\n\n1300 (2-door saloon, 4-door saloon, 5-door estate car)\n1300 GL (2-door saloon, 4-door saloon, 5-door estate car)\n1600 GL (2-door saloon, 4-door saloon, 5-door estate car)\n1600 GLS (4-door saloon, 5-door estate car)\n1600 GT (2-door saloon, 4-door saloon)\nThese Danish versions had two-door equivalents which were sometimes exported back to the UK, since two-door models were phased out in the UK market in 1979. The Hillman Avenger name was not used, instead the cars were simply badged as Sunbeam and the engine size and trim level (e.g. Sunbeam 1600 GLS).\nThroughout most of Europe the Sunbeam name was used, except for the Netherlands, Italy and Spain.\n\nArgentina\nThe Avenger was built in Argentina between 1971 and 1990, initially as the Dodge 1500 (or Dodge 1500M with the 1.8 engine) as a four-door sedan.\nIn 1977, the Dodge 1500 GT-100 producing 105 bhp (78 kW) was introduced. It had the 1800 engine, two Stromberg carburettors, a 8.5 in (22 cm) diameter clutch and a high performance manifold. This model could be had only in dark blue or black with obligatory sports stripes. In 1978, the first station wagon (estate version)\u2013Dodge 1500 Rural\u2013were announced. Later on, the Rural was only available with the 1.8 liter engine, albeit still using the \"1500\" name.\nIn the beginning of 1980 Volkswagen acquired Chrysler International's remaining shares in their Argentinian subsidiary when the latter withdrew from South America (Volkswagen held 49% since earlier). The deal included the tooling to the Dodge 1500. The Chrysler range was discontinued, but the Dodge 1500 continued with a new \"Serie W\" suffix. In 1982 the car was renamed the Volkswagen 1500 (not to be confused with the totally different Volkswagen Type 3, which had been sold elsewhere in the world between 1961 and 1973 as a Volkswagen 1500 too).\nUnder Volkswagen, the car received its final facelift, gaining a sloping front grille which was more in vogue in the early 1980s. Details such as the rearview mirrors and doorhandles were replaced by squared-off units in black plastic, rather than the earlier chromed filigrane ones. Production ended in 1990, replaced with the more modern Volkswagen Gacel\/Senda, with a total of 262,668 units sold in its almost 20-year lifespan. This vehicle was very popular with taxi drivers, but by the end of 1998 they had all fallen foul of the ten-year age rule on Argentine taxi vehicles. It was also very popular in the early TC 2000 touring car racing series, winning the 1980, 1981 and 1982 championships.\n\nBrazil\nThe Avenger was also built in Brazil from 1973 until 1981 in two-door sedan form only, sold initially as Dodge 1800, named for its motor \u2014 the engine design was the same as found in Avengers sold elsewhere, although enlarged to a 1.8 L capacity. Styling was completely different from the British built Avengers (which only arrived four months later), with the bodywork from the A-pillar back being unique. The differences are very small, with the rear side window being somewhat larger and the overall appearance being slightly less curvy than the British model. More obvious is the use of larger bumpers, a four-headlamp grille (which was different from the design found on the quadruple headlamp Avengers and the American Plymouth Cricket), and conventional tail lights, which did not have the \"hockeystick\" shape of the Hillman Avenger. It was presented at the S\u00e3o Paulo Motor Show in November 1972.\nIn 1976, the car was renamed Dodge Polara (a nameplate Chrysler previously used on full-sized Dodge models in the U.S. and on a series of large Dodges in Argentina), and underwent a comprehensive facelift (in 1978), gaining the Chrysler Avenger's front styling, and dashboard setup, the revised bumpers and tail light treatments remaining unique to Brazil. A further light facelift was given in 1980 before production ceased in 1981.\n\nNew Zealand\nThe Avenger was sold by Todd Motors in New Zealand from 1970\u20131980 in four-door sedan and five-door wagon (1975 onward) forms only. Todd's of Petone and, later, Porirua also sold Chrysler Australia and Mitsubishi products and their assembly lines both at the original Petone plant (dating from the mid-1930s) and the new purpose-built plant opened in Porirua in 1974 were notable for the variety of models coming down the twin final assembly lines at any one time\u2014vehicles sharing the trim lines with the Avenger on a daily shift might include the Hillman Hunter, Chrysler Valiant and Alpine hatchback, Mitsubishi Galant, Mirage and Lancer, as well as the Datsun 180B (due to Todd Motors for a time having a contract to build those as Nissan's other contractor at the time, Campbell Motor Industries, did not have enough capacity).\nThe New Zealand Avenger initially was similar to the British line but there was just one engine and trim level to start: the 'Super' (two headlights, vinyl trim, 1.5 L single carburettor engine, manual 4-speed gearbox.). In 1971 Todd's added a unique-to-NZ, sporty, 1.5-litre twin-carburettor 'TC' model with all-black interior trim, dashtop rev counter, side striping, high-back 'tombstone' front seats, special bright paint colours and new wheel trims, among other detail changes. This was loosely based on the UK GT but lacked that car's 'Rostyle' wheels, using locally-made, look-alike pressed aluminium wheel trims instead.\nThe TC was effectively replaced in 1973 by the more upmarket Avenger Alpine, another local special loosely based on the UK 'GL' (four headlights, four-round-dials dashboard instead of a rectangular instrument cluster (though early cars had a blanked-off space instead of the rev counter standardised later), better trim, twin carburettors and vinyl roof), initially with the twin-carburettor 1.5 L engine (changed to a 1.6 L from 1973, later changed again to a single-carb unit and also available for the first time with automatic transmission, the Borg Warner 45 four-speed unit). The Super sedan also gained the 1.6 L engine and auto option in '73 while the range was expanded in 1975 when 1.3 L variants (a result of the fuel crisis that also prompted rival Ford New Zealand to reintroduce a Cortina 1.3) and 1.6 L manual or automatic 'Super' wagon models were added to the New Zealand assembled range.\nTodd's updated its Avenger line in 1978 with the Simca-style front end and dashboard and new tail lights, and added a luxury GLS version, similar to the UK model, in place of the earlier Alpine while the range was rebranded Chrysler Avenger. It again broadly followed the British lineup, albeit with a limited range of models, now consisting of a 1.3 GL sedan, a 1.6 LS wagon (marketed as Avenger Estate) and 1.6 GLS sedans, again with manual or automatic transmissions. The 'base' 1.3 GL sedan was a very popular entry level B-category model for rental car company Avis right up to the Avenger's demise in 1980.\nWhile Avenger models in Europe were rebranded as Talbot, the New Zealand Avengers kept the Chrysler branding for 1980. 1980 models could be identified by a black grille, protective black body-side mouldings, window blackouts and unadorned steel wheels.\nAn unusual variant unique to New Zealand, available for some years, was a \"van\", basically the manual Avenger wagon with a flat rear floor in place of rear seats and fixed, rather than wind-down, rear door windows. This, and rival models, was introduced around 1975 to get around strict post-oil crisis government hire purchase laws in the country that required a 60 per cent deposit for a new car with only 12-month terms versus 25 per cent and three years for a light commercial vehicle, which is what these so-called \"vans\" were classified as.\nUnlike British models, all New Zealand Avengers from 1973 onwards had metric instruments.\nAlong with the 1971\u20131979 Vauxhall HC Viva, 1968-72 FD Victors, and 1976\u20131981 Vauxhall Chevette ranges, and Austin Allegro, Maxi and Princess, the Avenger was one of several British models to be sold in New Zealand but not Australia. The Avenger was planned initially as a Hillman Hunter replacement for Australia but, due to economics of sourcing, the Japanese Mitsubishi Galant was chosen instead by Chrysler Australia for that market, though it was marketed as the 'Chrysler Galant'. By contrast in New Zealand, the Avenger, Hunter and Mitsubishi Galant (offered from 1972\u20131977 in coupe form only) co-existed together in Todd Motors' overall lineup, though the Avenger-sized (but much more cramped inside) Mitsubishi Lancer eventually went into local assembly in 1975.\n\nSouth Africa\nThe Avenger was assembled and sold in South Africa badged as the Dodge Avenger. To satisfy local content rules a locally made 1.6 L Peugeot engine, shared with the locally assembled Peugeot 404, was used. The Avenger was available from 1975 until its discontinuation in 1976, when it was renamed as a Chrysler. After Chrysler ZA was merged into Sigma Motor Corporation in 1976, the Avenger was soon cancelled to allow SIGMA to free up more production capacity for the Mazda 323.\n\nIran\nThe Avenger was built in Iran from 1978\u20131980 in two-door, 60 hp (45 kW) form by Iran Khodro Co. and called the Hillman Avenger aside the locally manufactured Hillman Hunter (called Paykan). The engine used in it was the Hunter engine also used in the Paykan. The 4-door Avenger was imported to Iran for a few years starting in 1975.\n\nUruguay\nAn Avenger-based coupe utility (pickup) called the Dodge 1500 Pickup was made in Uruguay, but the conversion failed to properly account for structural rigidity and they literally broke apart.\n\n1977: Chrysler Sunbeam hatchback\nIn 1977, a hatchback variant was introduced, known as the Chrysler Sunbeam. This was based on a shortened version of the Avenger's floorplan, and was intended to compete in the lower \"supermini\" class. It also shared doors with the 2-door Avenger. Initially three engines were available: a 928 cc Hillman Imp-derived unit and 1300 and 1600 Avenger units. A sporty \"Ti\" version was soon introduced, also with a 1600 engine.\nThe model's name was a revival of the Rootes Sunbeam marque, which had recently been killed off along with the final Sunbeam model, the Rapier.\nIn 1979, Chrysler unveiled the Sunbeam Lotus at the Geneva Motor Show. Developed in conjunction with Lotus with rallying in mind (because none of the existing models were competitive) and using a 2200 cc Lotus engine, the road-going version of the rally car was not actually ready for delivery to the public until after the Peugeot buyout, and thus became the Talbot Sunbeam Lotus. At first, these were produced mostly in Lotus' then tobacco-sponsorship colours of black and silver, although later models came in a turquoise and silver scheme.\n\nAvenger and Cricket in motorsport\nDespite the humble underpinnings, the Avenger was a successful car in motorsport; it was a frequent strong achiever in the British Saloon Car Championship owing to the \"tuneability\" of its engine. The road-going version, the 4-door Avenger Tiger, is now a sought-after classic car.\n\nIn the U.S., driver Scott Harvey was known to have rallied a Plymouth Cricket to win the Press on Regardless Rally of 1971.\nNorthern Ireland based Robin Eyre-Maunsell was a works driver for the factory Avenger rally team, run by Des O'Dell, and won the British Group 1 Rally Championship in 1975 and 1976.\nThe late Bernard Unett won the British Saloon Car Championship using Avengers in 1974, 1976 and 1977.\nScottish rallydriver Andrew Cowan won the 1976 Heatway Rally of New Zealand in a Hillman Avenger 2-door in 1976, fitted with the expanded 1800 cc Brazilian Dodge 1800\/Polara engine.\n\nSurvival rate\nThe Avenger was one of the most popular British cars of the 1970s, although by the end of the decade its popularity was falling, probably due to the arrival of more modern competitors like the Volkswagen Golf, although Chrysler Europe had launched the more modern Horizon to compete in the same market sector as the Avenger. In February 2016, it was reported that just 260 examples of the Avenger were still on Britain's roads.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nAvenger\/Cricket\/Sunbeam page at Allpar.com\nAvenger web page\nBrief history, with illustration, of the Sunbeam Lotus","57":"Hudson's Bay is a syndicated 1959 Western television series set in Canada, and filmed in black-and-white.

Based on the Common Modular Platform closely shared with the second-generation Peugeot 2008 and positioned below the Renegade, it is the smallest vehicle offered by Jeep.\nThe \"Avenger\" nameplate has previously been used by Chrysler, previous parent company of Jeep on two previous occasions, namely the Dodge Avenger (a North American product) on sale between 1994 and 2000, then 2008\u20132014; and before that on the Hillman Avenger (built by Chrysler's long defunct European division) in the 1970s.\n\nOverview\nThe Avenger was presented on 8 September 2022 and at the 2022 Paris Motor Show in October. It is offered with mild hybrid and battery electric models. It uses the STLA Small platform, a development from the CMP platform (eCMP for the electric model) originally developed by the PSA Group, and shared with the Peugeot 2008, Opel Mokka and DS 3 Crossback.\nThe Avenger offers a 200 mm (7.9 in) ground clearance, 20 degrees of approach angle, and 32 degrees of departure angle. It is also equipped with Jeep's \"Selec-Terrain\" drive mode (with Normal, Eco, Sport, Snow, Mud, and Sand modes) and Hill Descent Control.\nDesigned in Italy and manufactured in Poland, the Avenger is primarily marketed in Europe, with sales in Turkey, Morocco, Japan and South Korea also planned. It is not available in the United States, Canada, and China. Deliveries to customers started in early 2023, with Jeep targeting annual production of 110,000 units.\n\nAvenger EV\nThe battery electric version was available before the petrol-powered model, and is the sole version of the Avenger in most markets. It is equipped with a 400 V front-mounted electric motor manufactured by Emotors, producing 156 PS (154 hp; 115 kW) and 260 N\u22c5m (26.5 kg\u22c5m; 192 lb\u22c5ft) of torque. Equipped with a 54 kWh battery, the Avenger EV offers a WLTP range of up to 400 km (250 mi) (550 km (340 mi) in urban cycle).\n\nAvenger 4xe\nThe four-wheel-drive version of the Avenger was preceded by the Jeep Avenger 4xe concept car, (alternatively referred to as the Avenger 4x4) presented at the 2022 Paris Motor Show in October.

In 1960, it bought a share in the Meguro motorcycle company that since the 1930s had made four-stroke singles up to 500 cc and later twins up to 650 cc for the Japanese and south-east Asian markets. Since 1963, Kawasaki took complete control of Meguro, and the Meguro model K 500 cc four-stroke parallel-twin was re-badged as a Kawasaki.\nThe Kawasaki W1 650 cc (actually 624 cc) four-stroke twin was developed from the Meguro K series, which Meguro had developed from a BSA A7 under license.\nKawasaki developed the lighter Kawasaki A1 Samurai during 1966. It was quickly followed by the larger bore model, the A7 Avenger, which is similar to the Samurai. Sharing all of the Samurai components aside from pistons, piston rings, different mufflers with reverse cones, it also features a race-developed oiling system called Injectolube. Oil is not only injected in with the petrol as on the 250 but is also fed to the main bearings. The crankcases and crank were also redesigned for use with the Injectolube system.\nThe A7SS Avenger has a crossover dual exhaust mounted on the left side and just below the seat. Other than the exhaust system, there are no other changes between the standard A7 and A7SS.\n\nEngine\nThe engine was advanced for its time, with features normally seen on race bikes: two-cylinder, two-stroke, air-cooled, oil injected, dual rotary valve. While other manufactures had utilized the advantages of rotary disc valve induction on small single-cylinder machines, only Kawasaki and Bridgestone produced twin-cylinder machines. Rotary disc valve induction ensures that all the fuel charge is used and not partly lost (as in a piston ported engine). As a result, it produces more power, more torque at low revs and better response throughout the rev range. The engine's initial air supply begins in an air filter canister below the seat and is drawn through a large plenum chamber just above the transmission and behind the cylinder head, then down into the internal passages leading to the carburetor housing feeding the carburetors.\nThe A7 Avenger has two Mikuni carburetors located on the engine's left and right sides and in line with the crankshaft. The carburetors are enclosed and protected from the elements by carburetor covers fixed to the crankcase. Inboard of each carburetor, and supporting each carburetor, is the disc cover. The rotary disc valve is housed inboard of that cover. During 1969, the ignition system was equipped with a capacitor discharge ignition including thyristor-based switching system that increases the voltage to between 25,000 and 30,000 volts reducing the unburned fuel mixture within the cylinders.\nDuring the development of the Kawasaki H1 Mach III, engineers considered using the Avenger's twin-cylinder engine bored out to create the new 500 cc two-stroke power plant as called for in the N100 Plan.\n\nRacing\nA7 Avengers participate in the American Historic Racing Motorcycle Association (AHRMA) competition.\nKawasaki Mach III's successfully raced with Ginger Molloy aboard his \"Green Meanie\" finishing 2nd just behind Giacomo Agostini's MV Agusta during the 1970 500 cc World Championship. \n\n\n== References ==","61":"The Lesbian Avengers were founded in 1992 in New York City, the direct action group was formed with the intent to create an organization that focuses on lesbian issues and visibility through humorous and untraditional activism. The group was founded by six individuals: Ana Maria Simo, Anne Maguire, Anne-Christine D'Adesky, Marie Honan, Maxine Wolfe, and Sarah Schulman.\nThe founding members of the Avengers attempted to address the lack of visibility lesbians had throughout the media. Multiple members claimed that the lack of diversity and the focus on white men in the gay rights movement is one of the reasons that inspired them to create a movement for lesbians.\nThere were multiple chapters of the Lesbian Avengers within different cities such as: New York, San Francisco, and Denver. Different chapters of the Lesbian Avengers expanded their missions to focus on issues of race, class, and gender. The Lesbian Avengers engaged in different forms of activism. One of the most notable accomplishments is the formation of the annual Dyke March. Other notable forms of activism include fire-breathing and protests against Proposition 8.\nThough some groups continue to hold demonstrations on an irregular basis (San Francisco Avengers demonstrated against Proposition 8), one of the Lesbian Avengers' most enduring legacy may be the annual Dyke March.\n\nOrigins\nFounding\nThe Lesbian Avengers was founded by six women: Ana Maria Simo, Anne Maguire, Anne-Christine D'askey, Marie Honan, Maxine Wolfe, and Sarah Schulman. Each of these women had experience in advocating for gay rights and equality under different organizations such as ACT-UP and the Irish Lesbian and Gay Organization (ILGO). The co-founders sought to create an inclusive movement that focused on lesbian issues, something they felt was not properly addressed in other organizations.\nTheir first recruiting flyer, handed out at New York's Pride March, invited \"LESBIANS! DYKES! GAY WOMEN!\" to get involved. \"We're wasting our lives being careful. Imagine what your life could be. Aren't you ready to make it happen?\"\nThe Lesbian Avenger handbook was an important foundation that gave the Avengers their ability to organize meetings, fundraise, and responses to media. The handbook \"made it possible for lesbians across the world to start Avenger chapters without having a huge pool of experienced activists.\" The handbook played an essential role in the organization and was a tool used by the experienced and newcomers of the group.\n\nGrowth\nThe New York chapter started with an estimated 50 members. Eventually new chapters were introduced in multiple locations, over 35 chapters emerged worldwide. A handful chapters were present internationally. The Avengers garnered attention through their use of demonstrations, which were combined with flyers and memorable catchphrases. The Lesbian Avengers designated members to focus on different tasks such as event organizing and designing flyers for events. A notable artist within the group was Carrie Moyer, an American painter who designed some the posters and logos used by the group.\nIn 1993, the documentary film The Lesbian Avengers Eat Fire, Too was released. The film documents the first year of activity within the group and includes interviews with the members of the New York chapter.\n\nActions\nThe Lesbian Avenger Handbook encouraged particular attention to the visual elements of the demonstration. \"It should let people know clearly and quickly who we are and why we are there. NY Avengers have used a wide range of visuals such as fire eating, a twelve-foot shrine, a huge bomb, a ten-foot plaster statue, flaming torches, etc. The more fabulous, witty, and original, the better.\"\nSometimes their positions seem to change, as well.  In the early years, the group opposed attempts to legitimize gay marriage, protesting the notion at an Andrew Sullivan book signing in 1995.\nThe New York Lesbian Avengers also developed a Lesbian Avenger Civil Rights Organizing Project.\n\nFirst action: rainbow curriculum\nOn their first action (September 9, 1992), the Lesbian Avengers targeted right-wing attempts to suppress a multicultural \"Children of the Rainbow\" curriculum for elementary schoolchildren. Ostensibly under attack for including lesbians and gay men in its lessons about diversity, some activists like Ana Maria Simo charged that opponents, besides being homophobic, also had a racist agenda in battling the multicultural curriculum.\nMeeting in Queens School District 24 where the opposition to the \"Rainbow Curriculum\" was strongest, they paraded through the neighborhood with an all-lesbian marching band to a local elementary school where they gave out lavender balloons to children and their parents saying \"Ask About Lesbian Lives\". They also wore tee-shirts reading, \"I was a lesbian child\".\nThis first action exemplified the Avenger approach.\nThey also demonstrated without permits, refusing to ask for permission to express themselves. Organizer Kelly Cogswell later elaborated on this principle during the 1994 International Dyke March, \"We ask for a permit; they can say no.\"\nAbove all, their choice of action reflected their commitment to challenging homophobic stereotypes. In this case, some members objected to going anywhere near children since lesbians and gay men had so often been portrayed as child molesters. Other members thought that was precisely why their presence was essential. And that was the eventual consensus of the group.\n\nRole of media: love and hate\nPress played an important role in the Lesbian Avengers. One article characterized them as \"a protest outfit formed to attract media attention to lesbian causes.\" Besides shaping actions for visual impact, there were committees dedicated to outreach and \"propaganda\". The handbook offered a step by step guide on the processes necessary to attract press attention from mainstream and lesbian and gay media, even examples of press releases.\n\nConflicts over the handling of the press coverage of the Dyke March also occurred within the New York gay and lesbian political community. In an interview, Simo said that a press release sent out by the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) after Stonewall 25 initially did not have anything in it about the Dyke March. After the Avengers brought this issue to GLAAD's attention, one line was added to the end of the press release about the lack of mainstream press coverage about the Dyke March.\nAware of the power of the press, the Lesbian Avengers sometimes didn't court it, but attacked it. They invaded the offices of Self magazine when that publication planned a trip to Colorado despite a lesbian and gay boycott of the state for hate legislation, and in the resulting media coverage were misnamed \"The Lesbian Agenda.\"\nThe Avengers also collaborated with Las Buenas Amigas and African Ancestral Lesbians United for Societal Change in a series of actions against homophobic and racist radio programs at La Mega 97.9 in New York, and its parent company, the Spanish Broadcasting System, informing advertisers, staging demonstration, and briefly taking over the radio station and broadcasting their own message.\n\nFire-eating\nUse of fire and fire-eating became something of a symbol for the Lesbian Avengers, and spread from the New York group to many others. The first time the Avengers engaged in fire-breathing was on October 30, 1992, in New York. This was done in honor of Hattie Mae Cohens and Brian Mock, to \"...transform the image of their deaths by learning to eat fire.\" The New York Times, in one of its few articles on the Avengers, explained:\n\n[It] grew out of tragedy. Last year, a lesbian and a gay man, Hattie Mae Cohens and Brian Mock, burned to death in Salem, Ore., after a Molotov cocktail was tossed into the apartment they shared. A month later, on Halloween, at a memorial to the victims in New York City, the Avengers (then newly organized) gave their response to the deaths. They ate fire, chanting, as they still do: \"The fire will not consume us. We take it and make it our own.\nAt the Washington Dyke March held during the anniversary celebrations of the Lesbian and Gay March on Washington in 1993, the Lesbian Avengers ate fire in front of the White House surrounded by a crowd of an estimated 20,000 lesbians.\n\nThe Dyke March\nAccording to co-founder Sarah Schulman, \"It was at the 1993 March on Washington that the Avengers and ACT-UP Women's Network created the first Dyke March -- with 20,000 women, marching together with no permit. These participants brought the marches home to their cities and countries and created a new tradition.\"\nThe first Dyke March was initiated by the San Francisco Lesbian Avengers chapter in 1993, it was done during the 1993 March on Washington. Around 20,000 lesbians attended the first march. Eventually, the New York chapter followed and began holding their own Dyke march. The march was held in Washington, the success of the initial march led to marches across other cities such as: New York, West Hollywood, Chicago, and many more locations nationally and internationally. Currently, the marches still exist and are held in June and are done in honor of the Stonewall riots and other notable events in LGBT history.\n\nChapters\nNew York chapter\nThe New York Chapter was the beginning of the Lesbian Avengers. The Avengers in New York worked from 1992 to 1995, their last action involved protesting comments Joseph Bruno made toward the LGBT community. The first official action of the New York Lesbian Avenger Chapter was a protest against right-wing opposition to New York's Rainbow Curriculum. The Avengers marched on the first day of classes in opposition to those who refused to implement the curriculum. Many of the actions taken by the New York Chapter were in relation to politicians who made homophobic remarks, actions to increase lesbian visibility, and volunteer work across different organizations.\nThe New York Chapter partnered with The New York City Anti-Violence Project (AVP) to protest the violence that queer people were faced with during Halloween Celebrations. Additionally, much of the activism the Avengers engaged in addressed the murders of gay people. Their first protest was in regard to the murders of two gay people, Hattie Mae Cohens and Brian Mock. The avengers held a press conference in Manhattan City Hall to bring awareness to the situation.\n\nSan Francisco chapter\nThe San Francisco Chapter of the Lesbian Avengers was founded in 1993 and actively engaged in different forms of activism until 1997. The San Francisco chapter is responsible for creating the biggest avenger event, The Dyke March. According to Kelly Cogswell, the march mobilized approximately 20,000 lesbians and the success of the event led to the opening of around 60 new chapters.\nAnother major action the Avengers took was in response to Exodus International and their use of conversion therapy. On February 9, 1995, a group of five avengers entered the headquarters and proceeded to demonstrate against the organization. The Avengers came with posters and began chanting in the building. The Avengers brought 1,000 crickets, which they released into the headquarters, causing alarm among from members of Exodus International.\nThe issues that this chapter targeted varied. They held protests, brought awareness to the AIDS crisis, and organized events to mobilize lesbians.\n\nInternational chapters\nThe Lesbian Avengers grew outside of the borders within the United States. There were chapters located within different cities in Canada, Europe, and Australia. The most well-known international chapter was located in London, England. Members of the London chapter were also ex members of the group OutRage! Members of the London chapter would focus on different issues, many of their actions aimed to increase lesbian visibility. Members re-created Romeo and Juliet will a full lesbian cast and protested homophobic groups and organizations across London. Despite the presence of international chapters, the documented activities of these chapters are limited.\n\nSee also\nHuman Rights Campaign\nLesbian erasure\nOff our backs\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nCogswell, Kelly.

Ana Alicia played two different characters and Jane Wyman's poor health resulted in the show's episodes being reduced from 28 to 22.\n\nSeason 9 (1989\u201390)\nThis is the final season of Falcon Crest and the only season in which Jane Wyman does not appear in nearly every episode, due to her ongoing health problems. The show went into a different direction by adding 2 new cast members (Gregory Harrison and Wendy Phillips), who replaced Susan Sullivan. Against her doctors' orders, Jane Wyman appeared for the show's final 3 episodes.\n\nRatings\nReferences\nExternal links\nFalcon Crest at IMDb","66":"This is a list of episodes of the television series The Defenders.\n\nSeries overview\nEpisodes\nSeason 1 (1961\u201362)\nSeason 2 (1962\u201363)\nSeason 3 (1963\u201364)\nSeason 4 (1964\u201365)\nReferences\nExternal links\nThe Defenders at IMDb","67":"The Lone Ranger is an American Western television series that originally aired on the ABC network.

They folded on April 19, 2009.\n\nHistory\nThe Los Angeles Avengers played their home games at the Staples Center, which is also the current home to the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League, the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers of the National Basketball Association, the Los Angeles Sparks of the Women's National Basketball Association. The team began play in the 2000 season. The Avengers competed in the Western Division of the American Conference. Since its inception in 2000, the Avengers had competed in postseason play five times. The Avengers earned American Conference wildcard playoff berths in 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2007, and won the American Conference Western Division Championship in 2005.\nThe Avengers franchise was owned by Casey Wasserman, grandson of the MCA head Lew Wasserman.\nAs part of the Avengers's marketing plan as they got off the ground in 2000, the team placed risqu\u00e9 billboard slogans around Greater Los Angeles, with slogans including \"On April 9th, Twelve Men Will Go Both Ways,\" meaning the members will play both offense and defense. One such sign, reading \"Six Beautiful Women Will Show You Their Panties\" (a joking reference to the team's cheerleaders) aroused the ire of Rick Cole, then City Manager of Azusa. He responded by borrowing a City truck and splashing paint over the sign, further publicizing the Avengers. Following Rick Cole's apology and compensation payments, the Los Angeles District Attorney's office chose not to file vandalism charges.\nOn April 10, 2005, in a game against the New York Dragons, offensive lineman\/defensive tackle Al Lucas tackled Corey Johnson during a kickoff return with 10:17 to go in the first quarter. Replays showed that Johnson's knee hit Lucas' helmet, and Lucas did not move again after falling to the ground.  Later replays and reports showed nothing abnormal on the play.  Dr. William Lang, the team physician, attempted to revive him on the field. He appeared to suffer a spinal cord injury. After being treated for approximately a half an hour at the Staples Center, Lucas was rushed to nearby California Hospital Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead at 1:28pm PDT.  He was only 26 years of age.  It is unknown whether Lucas died on the field, or after treatment failed. An autopsy revealed that he died of blunt force trauma and an upper spinal cord injury.  It is the only fatal injury incurred during a game in the history of the league. The Al Lucas Hero Award is named after him.\nThe Avengers announced the termination of the program on April 20, 2009, after nine years of operation. Four years later, it was announced that the Los Angeles KISS would join the AFL starting in the 2014 season making them the fourth team to set up shop in the Los Angeles area.\nThe Avengers' official mascot was a superhero-like character named T.D.\n\nMemorable Avengers' highlights\nOn Sunday, March 30, 2003, in a Week 9 road game against the Orlando Predators, the Avengers trailed 63\u201358 late in the game.

Based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers, the plot follows Inhuman teenager Kamala Khan, who gains superpowers during A-Day, a celebratory day for the Avengers, which ends in tragedy following a terrorist attack. Blamed for the disaster, the Avengers disband and allow science corporation A.I.M. to take their place. Five years later, when A.I.M. threatens to eliminate all Inhuman individuals, Kamala embarks on a quest to reassemble the Avengers to combat this new enemy.\nMarvel's Avengers is played from a third-person perspective and has both single-player and multiplayer modes; it features an online co-op mode, allowing players to assemble a team of heroes of their own.

Within the game's narrative, superheroes have been outlawed while A.I.M. takes the Avengers' place in society as a peacekeeping force, promising to find a cure for what is dubbed the \"Inhuman Disease\". A.I.M. is headed by Monica Rappaccini (Jolene Andersen) and George Tarleton \/ MODOK (Usman Ally), who is severely mutated as a result of the events of A-Day. Other villains include Emil Blonsky \/ Abomination (Jamieson Price), Tony Masters \/ Taskmaster (Walter Gray IV), and Loki (Travis Willingham). The game's DLC missions introduce more villains, namely the Super-Adaptoid, Lyle Getz (Darin De Paul), Maestro (Darin De Paul), Ulysses Klaue \/ Klaw (Steve Blum), and Brock Rumlow \/ Crossbones (Fred Tatasciore).\nNon-playable supporting characters in the game include Tony Stark's proprietary A.I. J.A.R.V.I.S. (Harry Hadden-Paton), Hank Pym (Danny Jacobs), Phil Sheldon (Walter Gray IV), Nick Fury (Charles Parnell), Maria Hill (Jennifer Hale), Dum Dum Dugan (Greg Baldwin), Jimmy Woo (Aleks Le), Dante Pertuz (Michael Johnston), Cerise (Cherry Thompson), Yusuf Khan (Brian George), Justin Hammer (Nicolas Roye), Lucky the Pizza Dog, Shuri (Erica Luttrell), Okoye (Debra Wilson), Zawavari (Dave Fennoy), Liz Allan (Elizabeth Grullon), and Mark Raxton (James Arnold Taylor).\n\nPlot\nMain story\nKamala attends a celebration event called \"Avengers Day\" which unveils the Avengers' second headquarters in San Francisco and their own Helicarrier called the Chimera. The ceremony is interrupted by a terrorist attack led by Taskmaster, which leads to the Chimera's Terrigen Crystal-powered core exploding and Captain America's apparent death. San Francisco is destroyed and blanketed by Terrigen Mist in the aftermath, which causes numerous individuals to involuntarily manifest superhuman powers as Inhumans, including Kamala. Blamed for the tragedy known as \"A-Day\", the Avengers disband and a company named A.I.M. rises to power.\nFive years later at her home in Jersey City, Kamala discovers damaged video footage which seemingly implicate a scientist named Tarleton in Captain America's death. She attempts to meet a contact from an anti-A.I.M. Resistance movement known as \"Tiny Dancer\", but is captured by Tarleton and Rappaccini. Kamala escapes and travels to Utah to find the Resistance's base of operations. Her search leads her to the Chimera's damaged remains in which she finds Hulk who attacks her before reverting into Banner. She convinces him to assist her in proving the Avengers' innocence. Traveling to a former S.H.I.E.L.D. compound to retrieve J.A.R.V.I.S., the two are confronted by A.I.M. and one of their operatives, Abomination. Hulk defeats him before he and Kamala return to the Chimera to reactivate J.A.R.V.I.S. and set out to reunite the Avengers. While they find Stark at his family estate, he bears a grudge against Banner because his testimony of A-Day incriminated the Avengers. Upon learning of Kamala's evidence, Stark agrees to join them and works to restore the Chimera.\nDuring their search for parts to help Stark, Kamala and Banner stumble upon the Ant Hill, an Inhuman sanctuary and the Resistance's headquarters run by Hank Pym. While assisting them, Kamala disobeys orders and attempts to raid an A.I.M. facility alone to save Inhuman prisoners, but is captured. While in custody, she learns Rappaccini's efforts to make an Inhuman cure are unsuccessful, leading Tarleton to prioritize the manufacturing of Adaptoid androids. Romanoff drops her cover within A.I.M. and infiltrates the facility. She captures Rappaccini, frees Kamala, and reveals her identity as \"Tiny Dancer\". Banner attempts to interrogate Rappaccini about the Adaptoid laboratory's whereabouts, but the latter resists before A.I.M. forces attack the Chimera and retrieve her. Witnessing the attack, Thor intervenes and re-joins the Avengers. J.A.R.V.I.S. restores the footage which shows Captain America ordering Tarleton to seal him inside so he can destroy the Chimera's reactor, apparently causing the explosion. Believing A-Day really was their fault, the Avengers fragment.\nWhile reviewing the interrogation footage, Kamala realizes A.I.M.'s Adaptoid laboratory is located off-world in a satellite called Ambrosia. She relays this information to the Avengers and rallies them with a heartfelt speech. Stark upgrades his suit to achieve space travel and infiltrates the satellite where he discovers Captain America is alive and placed in suspended animation so Rappaccini could harvest his blood to power the Adaptoids and covertly accelerate Tarleton's mutation. Thor comes to their rescue and they return to the Chimera, where Captain America reveals that he destroyed the reactor because it was unearthing an unidentified object underneath the bay that threatened to destabilize the San Andreas Fault and destroy California. Meanwhile, Tarleton discovers that Rappaccini's serum, while ostensibly keeping him alive, has deliberately induced his mutations and injects Rappaccini with it in retaliation.\nReassembled, the Avengers deduce that Rappaccini hired Taskmaster to hijack the Chimera and steal the Terrigen Crystal, which unearthed the buried object in the bay. They learn that Tarleton, now calling himself \"M.O.D.O.K.\", plans to exterminate Inhumans around the world and commit suicide afterwards. The Avengers storm his San Francisco fortress, but M.O.D.O.K. activates the object \u2013 a massive Kree Sentry \u2014 and overpowers them. Kamala unexpectedly grows to giant size, destroys the Kree Sentry, and sends M.O.D.O.K falling into the bay. After her recovery, Kamala returns home to her father Yusuf who allows her to discreetly join the Avengers.\nIn a mid-credits scene, Rappaccini becomes A.I.M.'s new leader, the Scientist Supreme, while the Sentry's remains launches a pod into space. In a post-credits scene, Maria Hill rallies the Avengers to undermine A.I.M.'s activities.\n\nSide stories\nThroughout the story progression, six side missions can be unlocked.\n\nMs. Marvel and Hulk learn that Abomination attempts to create a gamma army by transforming the people of a small town in Utah with gamma bombs around. While JARVIS deactivates the gamma bomb timers, Hulk defeats Abomination, then sends him and his A.I.M. troops to the authorities.\nBlack Widow leads a rescue ops to save the former A.I.M. scientist she befriended and is currently having trouble defecting to the Resistance side safely. Once the scientists are rescued, Black Widow's second leading mission is to infiltrate A.I.M.'s icy underwater base which contains the data of those who were present in A-Day and are currently Inhumans like Kamala.\nThor learns that an imposter assembled a cult of former A.I.M. agents known as \"Woken\" and is using them to create a synthetic Bifrost Bridge. As the Avengers stop the unstable Bifrost, the fake Thor, who turns out to be his brother, Loki, escapes.\nCaptain America leads an infiltration to an A.I.M. space station to broadcast the truth about A.I.M.'s true nature and confirmation of the Avengers' return, then raids A.I.M.'s bases at New Jersey alongside Resistance and S.H.I.E.L.D. troops led by Hank and Maria.\nAs Taskmaster has an ongoing contract with A.I.M. for five years, he collects data and uploads them to his contractor. However, as he is defeated by the Avengers, the last piece of data which Taskmaster was about to upload to A.I.M. has been destroyed by Maria, securing his arrest under S.H.I.E.L.D.'s custody.\n\"Reigning Supreme\" campaign's mission can only be unlocked after finishing the tasked side-missions. Once the campaign is cleared, a cutscene shows Kamala being officially made an Avenger.\n\nStory expansions\nTaking A.I.M.\nAfter a series of tachyon storms occur across the world, the Avengers investigate and discover their relation to A.I.M.'s experiments. While investigating an A.I.M. facility, they encounter Kate Bishop, Hawkeye's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and ex-Avenger-in-training. Meeting with her at a S.H.I.E.L.D. outpost, the Avengers learn that Hawkeye had been captured by A.I.M. while investigating Nick Fury's disappearance and its relation to the tachyon storms. Capturing A.I.M. scientist Lyle Getz, they interrogate him and learn that Rappaccini is attempting to master time travel. After Captain America offers her a chance to join the Avengers, Bishop leads the team on a raid, during which they discover Rappaccini is in contact with a future version of herself and that Hawkeye apparently works with her.\nConsulting Pym, the Avengers agree to travel back in time to rescue Hawkeye and end Rappaccini's experiments before they tear reality apart. With help from the Resistance, they construct their own time gate and go back to before Hawkeye initially went through A.I.M.'s portal and rescue him, whereupon he reveals that he was attempting to contact Fury, who is with the future Rappaccini, and that they are working together to avert a future apocalypse. Agreeing to let Hawkeye travel to the future, the Avengers return to the present to ensure he succeeds and takes control of Rappaccini's time gate after defeating a Super-Adaptoid created by her future self. Once Hawkeye returns to the present, Bishop destroys the gateway and agrees to join the Avengers as a full-time member.\nWhile debriefing the Avengers, Hawkeye reveals that Rappaccini was trying to thwart a Kree invasion with Fury's help. After the latter realized the battle was a lost cause, he sent Hawkeye to the past to prepare the Avengers for the invasion before it occurs. Before he can tell the Avengers more, Hawkeye suddenly falls unconscious due to the effects of time travel.\n\nFuture Imperfect\nSeveral weeks after falling into a coma, Hawkeye dreams about his future self searching for Fury and coming across a time gate built by Pym. Hawkeye then suddenly awakens and formally rejoins the Avengers as they resume their mission to save the future. Hawkeye goes to his home in Brooklyn to retrieve an essential package, only to find that most of his belongings have been stolen by the Watchdogs, A.I.M.'s hired guns, to lure Hawkeye into a trap and capture him. The Avengers recover Hawkeye's belongings before meeting with Pym at a S.H.I.E.L.D. outpost. Hawkeye gives him a SIM card to analyze, discovering it contains information about tachyons' ability to alter time.\nPym modifies a Quinjet to travel through time so that the Avengers can go to the future and find Fury. Amidst their search, they encounter a group of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents besieged by A.I.M. robots and save them. Learning the robots serve someone called the \"Supreme Leader\", the Avengers avoid them as they make their way to another S.H.I.E.L.D. hideout. There, they try to put together the clues they collected to locate Fury, but are forced to fend off an attack by the future Taskmaster. After defeating his troops, the future Hawkeye appears and offers to help the present-day Avengers change the future out of guilt for refusing to help when the Kree invasion occurred and inadvertently allowing the other Avengers to be killed. With his help, the Avengers learn Fury's last known location \u2013 Substation 99 \u2013 and go there to investigate. However, they encounter the Maestro, this timeline's Hulk who was driven mad with power after absorbing excess radiation from the nuclear fallout that destroyed most of humanity. Maestro reveals that he knows about the Avengers' plan to alter the future and attempts to stop them, but is ultimately defeated.\nVenturing further into Maestro's territory, future and present-day Hawkeye finds Fury, Rappaccini, numerous S.H.I.E.L.D. and A.I.M. agents, and Kree Sentries frozen in time by the Cosmic Cube, which Rappaccini built to help defeat the Kree. However, the cube trapped her and those around her in a time-bubble while the rest of the world collapsed into chaos. With no hope of rescuing Fury, future Hawkeye asks his present-day self to never give up on the Avengers so that this future does not happen. Hawkeye vows to do so, abandoning his retirement plans as he and the other Avengers return to the present.\n\nCosmic Cube\nFollowing the Avengers' venture into the future, a model Roy A.I.M.Bot assembles the team for a briefing to stop Rappaccini from using the cube's unstable power on her Project Omega, which would bring about the events that future Hawkeye warned of. When Rappaccini's machine becomes more unstable, she uses the cube's power against the Avengers despite potentially threatening reality and Hawkeye's warning. However, the future Hawkeye arrives in the present and sacrifices himself to send him and Rappaccini into a void, leaving the cube behind. While mourning for the future Hawkeye, the Resistance, S.H.I.E.L.D., and the Avengers work to find the present Fury's whereabouts and properly use Project Omega to stop the impending Kree invasion. Later, the A.I.M.bot holds the cube while securing it, causing the latter to activate and affect another nearby Roy model A.I.M.bot.\n\nWar for Wakanda\nFor five years since the tragedy of A-Day caused Wakanda to re-isolate from the world once again, T'Challa, the current king of his home country and the current Black Panther, leads his people into battle against invading A.I.M. forces and a private army led by Ulysses Klaue, a longtime enemy of the country whose father Fritz Klaue was killed trying to steal Wakanda's precious resource vibranium. After stopping an invasion led by Crossbones at Wakanda's shielded capital Birnin Zana, T'Challa and his sister Shuri work with the Avengers to investigate Klaue's connection to the emergence of corrupted Vibranium in Wakanda and around the world. T'Challa attempts to use Wakanda's Kimoyo network to locate Klaue, but the latter hijacks and damages it before capturing and killing Shuri's research team. T'Challa orders the Wakandans to evacuate to Birnin Zana before joining the Avengers in confronting Klaue at Azzuri's Temple, only for Klaue to destroy it.\nUpon escaping and regrouping, the heroes learn Shuri intercepted a transmission between Klaue and another Rappacini clone in which she reprimands Klaue for prioritizing seeking revenge for his father and destroying potentially valuable information in the temple before retracting A.I.M.'s support. In retaliation, Klaue and his army storm Wakanda's vibranium mound while A.I.M. attacks Birnin Zana. As the Avengers stop Klaue's army from corrupting the vibranium core, T'Challa fights Klaue in close combat, during which the latter falls into the vibranium chambers and transforms into a being of pure sound. Now going by \"Klaw\", he and Crossbones overpower the heroes, forcing T'Challa and Shuri to redirect energy from Birnin Zana's shields to create a wavelength capable of weakening Klaw. Crossbones retreats while T'Challa and the Avengers defeat Klaw, who disintegrates. As Birnin Zana's shields are restored, T'Challa joins the Avengers in their fight against A.I.M. and passes the throne to Shuri, making her Queen Regent of Wakanda.\n\nDiscordant Sound\nIt is discovered by Shuri that Klaw survived his last encounter, albeit weakened for a time being, and will always return many times to get revenge on Wakanda and the Avengers. With the help of Zawavari and Okoye, Avengers immediately disperse Klaw and defend the Vibranium Mound.\n\nWith Great Power\nWhile the Avengers continue their fight against A.I.M., Peter Parker and Liz Allan apply for internships with the company only to learn A.I.M. is torturing Inhumans to create weapons with help from Allan's family's company Allan Chemicals. Parker and Allan ask the Avengers for help with Parker becoming Spider-Man to help the heroes expose A.I.M., while Liz joins the Resistance. It is revealed that Liz's half-brother Mark Raxton had been working undercover for his sister's sake to gather pieces of information for Spider-Man and the Avengers about A.I.M.'s dubious activities such as Spencer Smythe's downfall on siding with A.I.M. ever since the death of his son Alistair Smythe 5 years ago. With the evidence of A.I.M. and Spencer's crimes exposed and under investigation, Raxton uploads them to Daily Bugle and turns himself into the authorities for testimony against A.I.M.. Shortly after gaining a new suit as a reserved Avengers member, Peter gets a phone call from Aunt May before he goes swinging across the city at night.\n\nReturn of Nick Fury\nFollowing the Avengers' success in retrieving the Cosmic Cube from Monica and preventing the Future Imperfect timeline from happening, as well as their successful alliance with Wakandan army, Nick Fury resurfaces from the shadows and returns to lead S.H.I.E.L.D. once more.\n\nThe Mighty Jane Foster\nWhile preparing their current missions in their home timeline, the Avengers unexpectedly encounters a female Thor, who is revealed to be Jane Foster from the alternate present timeline and was transported to the former's universe as the result of Monica's tampering the tachyon affected her timeline as well.\nShe explains that in her timeline, the original Thor Odinson lost his left arm in presumably a previous battle instead and alternate Jane was diagnosed with cancer after A-Day, resulting in Odinson retiring from the Thor role and entrusting it to her to keep cancer in her on hold via Mjolnir after it chose her. Thus, the alternate Jane became part of the reassembled Avengers team in his stead. Because of Odinson's action, his father Odin Borson goes mad due to outside forces and desecrates the Ten Realms into chaos. Before so, knowing that she will not be able to defeat Odin, she made a temporary truce with Loki Laufeyson, allowing the god of mischief to kill the fallen All-Father while he is off-guard on focusing his fight against Jane-Thor.\nThis outcome leads to Jane-Thor's involvement in the original universe when she and Loki were about to end a deal of their temporary alliance before the former is unexpectedly pulled by a tachyon anomaly that affected her universe. Jane Foster of the prime universe, with whom Jane-Thor comes in contact, is revealed to be healthy because she was not present at A-Day.\n\nNo Rest for the Wicked\nBlack Widow, Captain America, and Ms. Marvel discover an unidentifiable energy reading at one of A.I.M.'s Utah Badlands facilities. There, the Avengers discover a creature who appears to be MODOK, enclosed in a strange machine. They find out that due to their exploits against A.I.M., Monica has become desperate to preserve it, and is now attempting to revive MODOK as a last-ditch effort to support A.I.M.\nShe attempts to fend off the Avengers once again, only to be defeated. But to their surprise, the real MODOK appears before her and transports himself and Monica away before the Avengers can do anything. As the heroes return to their base, they are still doubting MODOK's current situation while vowing to bring him and Monica to justice.\n\nThe Winter Soldier\nHaving presumably died at the end of World War II during his time as Captain America's sidekick, Bucky Barnes was found and brainwashed by Soviets' Red Room as a Winter Soldier, who often put him on ice until new missions are given to him each year, particularly during a Cold War. Until the day during his time trained by Red Room, Bucky fell in love with Black Widow, who partially restored some of his humanity and past memories. Unfortunately, when the Red Room caught them having a relationship \"forbidden\" to their rules, Bucky remains unfound, while Black Widow was eventually rescued by S.H.I.E.L.D., and became one of the founding members of the Avengers after Captain America was found on ice years later. Sometime later, Bucky eventually wakes up and escapes Red Room in the same year as A-Day occurred. For three years since Captain America's presumed demise in A-Day, A.I.M., particularly Monica acquired Red Room's assets to brainwash Bucky once more and experiment on him.\n\nAIM Cloning Lab\nTwo years later after the Avengers re-assembled, and Captain America was found alive thanks to Kamala, the team is informed that M.O.D.O.K. is waiting for them at A.I.M.'s Utah branch of the cloning lab, and learns that Monica has escaped from his wrath once again. After being defeated by the Avengers, M.O.D.O.K. has learned the Kree's arrival is nearing, and shows them Bucky's exact location before he presumably dies. It is revealed that Bucky is also being put into similar station like how Monica secretly did to Captain America in A.I.M.'s space station.\n\nA Dark and Heavy Star\nThanks to M.O.D.O.K.'s presumed death that allows Avengers to find Bucky's exact location, Bucky is offered to join the Avengers to redeem himself, in exchange for helping him find a way to remove the brainwashing protocols from his head.\n\nRelease\nA teaser trailer was released on Marvel Entertainment's YouTube channel in January 2017 which announced the game. The game was under the working title The Avengers Project. More than two years later at E3 2019, Square Enix hosted a press conference that shared more details on the game, including a full trailer and release date. The 14-minute presentation showcased a trailer made from in-game footage, a brief description of the gameplay including characters, multiplayer and customization, and a preview of the actors behind the game. A playable demo was available to show floor attendees behind closed doors.\nA closed beta was available for those who pre-ordered the game. This began 7 August and ran until 9 August for PlayStation 4. The closed beta came to Windows and Xbox One from 14 to 16 August, with an open beta for all PlayStation 4 users also being available during this weekend. A final open beta took place from 21 to 23 August for all launch platforms apart from Stadia.\nMarvel's Avengers was originally set to release on PlayStation 4, Stadia, Windows, and Xbox One on 15 May 2020, but was pushed back to 4 September, to adjust and polish the game. The game was released in four editions; a Standard Edition, an Exclusive Digital Edition (only for PS4), a Deluxe Edition, and an Earth's Mightiest Edition, with the latter three editions being playable from 1 September, and the standard edition releasing on 4 September. The game released on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on 18 March 2021. PS4 and Xbox One players are entitled to a free upgrade.\nPublishing rights for the Asian release of the game were handled by Bandai Namco Entertainment.\n\nPost-release content\nFollowing the initial release of the game, Crystal Dynamics developed several free downloadable content (DLC) packs adding new playable characters and missions that continue the game's story. In June 2020, the first of these expansions was revealed to focus on Hawkeye (Clint Barton). Later, in August, Spider-Man was announced as the second playable DLC character, exclusively to PlayStation. Crystal Dynamics studio head Scot Amos stated the exclusivity of Spider-Man came from Marvel and Sony's existing partnership, and clarified that he was meant to be the only console-exclusive character.\nOn 1 September, the third announced playable DLC character was Hawkeye (Kate Bishop). Kate's expansion, titled Operation: Kate Bishop \u2013 Taking A.I.M., was the first one to be released, on 8 December, after being delayed from its planned October release. The second expansion, Operation: Hawkeye \u2013 Future Imperfect, which patches Clint Barton as a playable character, was released on 18 March 2021. The third expansion, Operation: Black Panther \u2013 War for Wakanda, which added Black Panther to the game, was released on 17 August 2021. Hero Event: Spider-Man \u2013 With Great Power was released on 30 November 2021. Hero Event: The Mighty Thor was released on 28 June 2022, which adds Jane Foster version of Thor. Hero Event: Winter Soldier was released on 29 November 2022.\nOn 20 January 2023, Crystal Dynamics announced that all official support for Marvel's Avengers would end on 30 September and the game would be delisted from digital storefronts on 30 September 2023. Crystal Dynamics released the last content update on 31 March 2023.\n\nTie-in media and merchandise\nMarvel's Avengers: Road to A-Day\nMarvel Comics has published five tie-in prequel comics for the game in a collection called Marvel's Avengers: Road to A-Day. Each comic focuses on one of the five playable characters available at launch, excluding Ms. Marvel. The first comic to be released was Marvel's Avengers: Iron Man #1 on 11 December 2019, followed by Marvel's Avengers: Thor #1 on 8 January 2020, Marvel's Avengers: Hulk #1 on 5 February 2020, Marvel's Avengers: Captain America #1 on 18 March 2020, and concluding with Marvel's Avengers: Black Widow #1 on 25 March 2020.\n\nTie-in books\nTitan Books published two tie-in books for the game on 1 September 2020. The first book, titled Marvel's Avengers: The Extinction Key was written by Greg Keyes, is a prequel focused on the events that take place prior to the A-Day, which also sets the game's events in motion. The novel follows the Avengers as they try to prevent an ancient organization called the Zodiac from acquiring an infinitely powerful weapon capable of warping the very fabric of time and space \u2013 the Zodiac Key. The Extinction Key also introduces the game's versions of Doctor Strange and Brother Voodoo, as well as specific members of S.H.I.E.L.D. The second book, Marvel's Avengers: The Art of the Game contains concept art, storyboards and artist commentary, an intimate study of the Avengers, plus a detailed view at the different environments and missions in the game.\n\nFurther merchandise\nFunko released a set of Pop! Vinyl figurines based on the playable characters in the game that are available at launch, in addition to figures based on Taskmaster and Abomination. Black Widow received a glow-in-the-dark chase variant, with the stock of this variant being at a rate of one in every six Black Widow figures. Captain America, Thor, Iron Man, and Hulk also received alternate designs exclusive to certain retailers, with the first two being glow-in-the-dark variants. The designs for the characters were also loosely adapted for Lego Marvel Avengers sets releasing in 2020, though the events depicted are not from the game itself. There was also the release of several Hasbro figures to tie-in to the game. This includes 5-inch basic figures of Thor, Iron Man, Hulk, Taskmaster, Abomination, Captain America and Ms. Marvel as well as 6-inch Marvel Legends figures of Captain America, Iron Man, Ms. Marvel, Hulk and Abomination.\n\nReception\nCritical response\nMarvel's Avengers received \"mixed or average reviews\" from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic.\nDestructoid summarized its 6\/10 review by calling the game \"Slightly above average or simply inoffensive. Fans of the genre should enjoy it a bit, but a fair few will be left unfulfilled.\" Shacknews praised the campaign and unique character abilities, but noted the \"convoluted and uninspired\" menus and bug issues. USgamer scored the game 2.5\/5 stars and wrote: \"If Marvel's Avengers was just the single-player story campaign, it would be amazing. There, Crystal Dynamics sells you on its version of the Avengers and introduces the charming and endearing Ms. Marvel to players everywhere. Combat has depth to it, and each hero truly feels distinct. Unfortunately, the endgame is where our heroes falter, with broken matchmaking, rough options in terms of progression, and endlessly reused environments and enemies.\"\nElectronic Gaming Monthly said \"Marvel's Avengers squanders the potential of what might have been a fun superhero romp by grafting on an annoying, overly repetitive games-as-a-service component. Playing as the cast of heroes offers decent thrills, and the campaign tells an enjoyable enough story, but odds are good you'll get bored long before you grind your way to the top.\" Game Informer gave the game an 8.75\/10, writing: \"Developer Crystal Dynamics delivers a powerful superhero showcase that taps into each Avenger's unique abilities to light up the battlefield in thrilling ways, but when the dust settles, it slows down to show a softer, human side that is every bit as engaging, placing a character you wouldn't expect in the central role.\" IGN gave the game 6\/10, praising its combat, superhero flavor and campaign, but criticizing its technical issues, loot system and recycled, repetitive end-game.\n\nPost-release\nIn the weeks following its launch, Avengers saw a large player drop due to audiences frustrated at the game's problems, such as bugs, repetitive gameplay, and lack of content in the base game. One update included a patch that fixed over a thousand player-reported issues in the game. Peter Morics of Screen Rant reported around 1,190 players on Steam during a weekend in November 2020 \u2013 a 96% decline since the game's debut. Gene Park of The Washington Post noted that only over a thousand players were playing Avengers on PC, which he described as \"an early and worrying symptom of a dying live service game.\" The dwindling number of players, which Paul Tassi of Forbes observed as falling below 500 players at one point, have begun causing problems with matchmaking multiplayer games on PC.\nMike Fahey of Kotaku noted that players such as himself were growing bored with the game's repetitive features and lack of content, saying, \"We need new content. New enemies. New game mechanics... The initial excitement over playing beloved superheroes has dulled, thanks to a lack of variety in late-game content\". After receiving a statement from Crystal Dynamics, he advised players, \"There are plenty of other games out there to play, and as much as I would love to engage my superhero fantasies on a daily basis, nonstop for weeks on end, it's not currently happening in Marvel's Avengers.\" Thomas Carroll of Comic Book Resources felt that the game had \"plenty of bugs and crashes and a severe lack of content and customisation\" alongside a large $60 price tag for a live-service game. He believed that Square Enix relied too much on the established Marvel brand in marketing, instead of \"bothering to create a quality experience people would pay for once, then continue to pay for whenever new content was released.\" Paul Tassi enjoyed his initial experiences with the game, but over time grew frustrated over the game's bugs and underwhelming, grind-heavy loot system, concluding that it was \"too broken to effectively play right now.\" Although Gene Park commended Crystal Dynamics for listening to feedback and implementing fixes, he felt the game's lack of content in the base game highlighted that it \"didn't need to be a live service game, and it's become increasingly clear that it shouldn't have been in the first place.\"\n\nStory expansions\nThe Kate Bishop expansion was praised for its gameplay, voice work, and story, but some felt the added content was lacking. Fahey stated, \"It's not her powers and abilities that make Kate Bishop great in Marvel's Avengers. It's a combination of [whoever] is writing the game's hero banter and the voice acting of Ashly Burch. Burch is a sassy voice actor given incredibly sassy superhero banter and she just eats it up.\" Dave Trumbore of Collider felt it was a \"too-short introductory outing\" for Kate, whom he described as \"[bringing] an energy on par with Kamala Khan's youthful spirit and Tony Stark's sharp wit to the team, though it's her tool kit of melee\/ranged\/teleporting skills that are a cut above on the battlefield.\" Tassi was \"deeply impressed\" by the update's expansion on the campaign, voice work, and satisfying gameplay as Kate, but noted that this would do little to expand the game's current player base unless a large-scale expansion were added.\n\nSales\nIn the United Kingdom, Marvel's Avengers was the best-selling retail game during its first week on sale. In the United States, the game was the top-selling title for the month of September, and second-highest launch-month dollar sales of all-time for a superhero game behind Spider-Man. In Japan, the PlayStation 4 version sold 42,979 physical units within its first week on sale, making it the second-best-selling retail game of the week in the country. The game sold 3 million copies by November 2020. \nDespite initial strong sales, Avengers failed to turn a profit for Square Enix, with the publisher reporting an estimated loss of $63 million for their latest fiscal period at the time. In November 2021, Square Enix president Yosuke Matsuda described the game as a commercial disappointment for the company. However, he affirmed that service games would be an important focus for the company in the future.\nFollowing the Black Panther expansion in September 2021, the game returned to the top 10 of the UK video game chart for two weeks.\n\nControversies\nIn September 2021, Crystal Dynamics and Square Enix introduced XP boost, which can only be purchased through real-world money. XP boost allows players to gain more experience points for a short period of time, allowing them to level up faster. This move followed an update in March 2021, which altered the progression system to make the leveling-up process take significantly longer than it did when the game first launched. These changes drew ire from both the community and gaming journalists, especially as Square Enix had previously declared in 2019 that the game's microtransactions would only be redeemable for cosmetics and customization items and would not be used to create a pay-to-win system. Crystal Dynamics removed the XP boost from the in-game marketplace one month later, on 3 November.\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website","71":"Manowar is an American heavy metal band from Auburn, New York. Formed in 1980, the group is known for lyrics based on fantasy (particularly sword and sorcery) and mythology (particularly Norse mythology and Greco-Roman mythology), as well as numerous songs celebrating the genre and its core audience. The band is also known for a loud and emphatic sound. In an interview for MTV in February 2007, bassist Joey DeMaio lamented that \"these days, there's a real lack of big, epic metal that is drenched with crushing guitars and choirs and orchestras... so it's nice to be one of the few bands that's actually doing that\". In 1984, the band was included in the Guinness Book of World Records for delivering the loudest performance, a record which they have since broken on two occasions. They also hold the world record for the longest heavy metal concert after playing for five hours and 1 minute in Bulgaria (at Kavarna Rock Fest) in 2008. They also have been known for their slogan \"Death to false metal\".\n\nBiography\nOrigins (1980\u20131981)\nManowar's history began in 1980 when Joey DeMaio, the future bassist of the band, met guitarist Ross the Boss while working as a bass tech and fireworks manager for Black Sabbath on the Heaven & Hell Tour. Ross the Boss, a former member of the punk rock band the Dictators, was the guitar player in Black Sabbath's support band, Shakin' Street. The two bonded over their shared musical interests, became friends and decided to form a band with the suggestion and advice of Ronnie James Dio during the tour.\nAt the end of the tour with Black Sabbath, the duo got together to form Manowar. To complete the roster, they hired drummer Donnie Hamzik and singer Eric Adams, a former classmate and friend of DeMaio. The name Manowar was suggested to Joey DeMaio and Ross the Boss by their instrument designer, John \"Dawk\" Stillwell.\n\nBattle Hymns (1981\u20131982)\nOn the strength of their debut demo, Manowar secured a recording contract with label Liberty Records in 1981. The label pressured the band to produce a good number of songs in a short time towards a debut album. The resultant album, Battle Hymns, was released the following year. The legendary actor and director Orson Welles served in the role of narrator on \"Dark Avenger\".\nSoon after the album's release, Manowar engaged in their first tour. The band played support for hard rocker Ted Nugent, but their collaboration lasted only a few months. Manowar then decided to put together a short tour by themselves and all the arrangements were made in a few weeks by their manager. Despite these setbacks, the band gained domestic fame on this short tour and also began to get their first European fans, particularly in the United Kingdom and in Germany. Stressed from the strain of the continuing performances, Hamzik decided to leave the band at the end of this tour and was replaced with Scott Columbus.\n\nInto Glory Ride and mainstream success (1983\u20131988)\nBy 1983, the band left Liberty Records and struck a deal with Megaforce Records in the US and Music for Nations in Europe\u2014signing the contract in their own blood, to make a stance against the music industry they felt slighted by. The signing was a cover story in the 1983 July\u2013August issue No. 47 of Kerrang!.\nWhen Manowar returned home, they immediately went into a recording studio to produce what, in the intentions of the group, would have been a simple EP, but came out instead, due to the quantity and quality of the tracks made in that period, as the band's second album, Into Glory Ride. An EP was actually published in 1983 with the title Defender containing, as its main track, the eponymous song, which included more work by Orson Welles. The atmosphere of the album evoked classical heroic fantasy and mythology, and served as a predecessor to Viking metal. It contained several innovative features, both in style and sound, and led to a huge increase in the number of fans of the group, particularly in the United Kingdom, where the band planned a long tour that was ultimately canceled. The song \"Defender\" was later re-recorded and included in the Fighting the World album of 1987.\nTo apologize for the failure of their UK tour, Manowar decided to dedicate their next album to the United Kingdom. The album, Hail to England, was recorded and mixed in just six days and was released in early 1984.\nManowar soon returned to work in the recording studio. After leaving Music for Nations, the quartet released Sign of the Hammer ten months after their previous album.\nFollowing further disagreements with their new label, the group changed record label to Atlantic Records in 1987. Via Atlantic, they released Fighting the World, which enjoyed more extensive distribution and increased the band's prominence in the international heavy metal scene. Album art was designed by Ken Kelly.\nIn 1988, Manowar released the album Kings of Metal, which is the band's best known work. Songs like \"Heart of Steel\", \"Kings of Metal\" and \"Hail and Kill\" are performed regularly in concerts. Kings of Metal is Manowar's highest-selling album worldwide.\nManowar embarked on a world tour, for a period of approximately three years, with stops in almost all European nations. During that tour, Joey DeMaio \"fired\" Ross the Boss. According to a 2008 interview with the guitarist, \"Joey felt that Manowar would be better without me\". He was replaced by David Shankle, who was chosen by members of the band after a search among about 150 candidates. Scott Columbus later also decided to leave the band during the Kings of Metal tour. Columbus himself picked his replacement Kenny Earl Edwards (soon nicknamed 'Rhino').\n\nNew albums, first video, and live publications (1992\u20132002)\nA new musical unit after the recent changes, Manowar released The Triumph of Steel in 1992. It gained some success and was particularly famous for the presence of a suite lasting no less than 28 minutes entitled \"Achilles, Agony and Ecstasy in Eight Parts\", inspired by the events of the Iliad and the hero Achilles. After this release, the band went on a world tour for two years. After the expiration of their contract with Atlantic, the band signed with Geffen Records. In 1994, Shankle unexpectedly left the band to form his own group. He was replaced by Karl Logan, a musician met by DeMaio during a motor meeting. The same year saw the unexpected return of Scott Columbus, who replaced Edwards.\nIn 1996, they released Louder Than Hell, their first new studio album in four years. Despite good sales the album was criticized for its simple style.\nDespite such criticisms, Manowar released a new collection, called Anthology, and their first live album, Hell on Wheels, released by BMG International in the guise of a double CD containing all the most popular songs of the group. Not having the time to record a new studio album because of the ongoing promotional tour, Manowar released a second live album, Hell on Stage.\n\nWarriors of the World, Hell on Earth, and Magic Circle Music (2002\u20132005)\nIn 2002, six years after the last studio album, Manowar released the Warriors of the World album. Warriors of the World presented a sound somewhat renewed in style, but maintained the usual energy and power. The most famous tracks from the album became \"Warriors of the World United\", \"House of Death\" and \"Call to Arms\", in addition to Puccini's aria \"Nessun Dorma\", covered in honor of the Italian fans and sung live for the first time in a concert in Milan, Italy.\nManowar then began a long world tour, called \"Warriors of the World United Tour\" that kept them busy and away from a recording studio for a long time. To compensate for the lack of studio albums, the band released several DVDs: in 2002 the video Fire and Blood, in 2003 Hell on Earth Part III and in 2005 Hell on Earth Part IV. These (and all DVDs since the year 2000) were directed by Neil Johnson, and have all been certified Gold in Germany.\nIn 2003, DeMaio founded his own record label, Magic Circle Music, which became the official home of the band, having been created to fit the needs of Manowar, and other bands of similar genre. Under the label Magic Circle were also released the EP The Sons of Odin with footage taken during the Earthshaker Fest 2005.\n\nGods of War and Thunder in the Sky (2006\u20132009)\nManowar released Gods of War through Magic Circle Music in 2007. After playing numerous shows in Europe, including a concert that spanned the course of two nights, they worked on a new EP, entitled Thunder in the Sky, which was released in 2009. The EP consisted of two discs: the first playing the regular track list; the second playing the song \"Father\" in fifteen different languages.\n\nScott Columbus' death, Battle Hymns MMXI, and The Lord of Steel (2010\u20132013)\nOn June 1, 2010, Classic Rock magazine published an interview with drummer Scott Columbus who said that he had not worked with the band since April 2008 and had left the band. He also said that statements made in the past, regarding his break in 1990 and 2008 because of an illness and a personal tragedy, were largely untrue and were made without his agreement. On October 15, 2010, Joey DeMaio announced on Facebook that Hamzik was officially a member of Manowar again after a 26-year absence.\nOn April 4, 2011, Columbus died at the age of 54. On April 5, 2020, Columbus' daughter Teresa publicly announced that her father's cause of death was suicide, and urged for more awareness on mental illness and depression.\nManowar's subsequent release was a re-recording of their 1982 debut album Battle Hymns. This album was released on November 26, 2010, with the narration of Sir Christopher Lee and formally entitled Battle Hymns MMXI. On July 21, 2011, the band embarked on a UK tour for the first time in 16 years in November and performed the Battle Hymns album in its entirety.\nManowar's next studio album, The Lord of Steel, was released worldwide on June 16, 2012, exclusively on iTunes and on the band's own online store. The album sees a reversion from the symphonic elements present on the Gods of War album back to a more straightforward, heavy metal sound. The song \"El Gringo\" is featured in the soundtrack to the film of the same name.\nAfter the Lord of Steel tour was over in 2013, Manowar released a live EP, titled The Lord of Steel Live, which included six live tracks recorded during the tour.\n\nKings of Metal MMXIV (2013\u20132014)\nOn July 28, 2013, Manowar announced that they would be re-recording their 1988 release Kings of Metal with an expected release date of late 2013. Brian Blessed recorded his narration for the track \"The Warrior's Prayer\" at Circle (Recording) Studios in Birmingham, England. Like the re-recording of Battle Hymns MMXI, this album allowed the band to use modern day technology.\nKings of Metal MMXIV was released through iTunes as a digital download on February 4, 2014. Hard copies of the album were released on February 28.\nThe embarked on a world tour in support of the album in 2014.\n\nUpcoming twelfth studio album, Logan's arrest, and continued touring (2015\u2013present)\nOn May 22, 2015, Manowar announced that they were currently working on a new studio album that was set to be released in early 2016. This album was not released, and instead they went to Europe in early 2016 for the \"Gods and Kings World Tour 2016\" which included their first concerts in Slovakia, Latvia and Belarus.\nOn May 25, 2016, the band announced that they would embark on their next world tour dubbed \"The Final Battle\". They would later recruit drummer Marcus Castellani from the tribute band Kings of Steel as their drummer for the tour.\nOn October 25, 2018, it was revealed that guitarist Karl Logan was arrested on August 9 in Charlotte, North Carolina, for allegedly possessing child pornography and was charged with six counts of third-degree exploitation of a minor. Manowar issued a statement shortly after saying that Logan would not perform with them. They then said that their upcoming album and tour would not be affected. Following Logan's arrest, former guitarist David Shankle expressed interest in rejoining the band.\nOn January 1, 2019, Manowar announced that guitarist E. V. Martel would join them on their tour. On March 22, 2019, the band announced that they would release a trilogy of EP's based upon The Final Battle World Tour. The first EP, The Final Battle I, was released on March 29 in an exclusive pre-sale at the merchandise booth in Frankfurt and also during the European shows. It was then released on iTunes worldwide that day. The EP was digitally and physically released on May 30. Former HammerFall and Yngwie Malmsteen drummer Anders Johansson was announced as the new live drummer shortly after and made his debut at the March 25 show in Brno. Despite the tour's name, bassist Joey DeMaio dismissed any claims of Manowar's retirement, mainly due to the fans' demands to have them continue to perform.\nIn June 2019, the band's appearance at Hellfest was cancelled for undisclosed reasons. Fans who were to attend the show expressed their disappointment towards their cancellation. Manowar stepped in and said that they did not cancel their performance, but that it was the festival's organizers who cancelled their appearance in an announcement that appeared on their website. Swedish band Sabaton replaced Manowar in the lineup. Joey DeMaio later said that the band filed a lawsuit against the Hellfest organizers.\nIn May 2020, Manowar announced that they would embark on a tour, beginning in April 2021 in Europe, to celebrate their 40th anniversary. However, the band did not tour in 2020 and 2021.\nOn June 4, 2022, the day of the first show of their 2022\/23 tour, it was announced drummer Anders Johansson could not perform with the band on their upcoming \"Crushing The Enemies of Metal Anniversary Tour '22\/'23\" due to family commitments, and was replaced by Dave Chedrick for the tour. On September 2, 2022, following the announcement by guitarist E. V. Martel that he would not be available for touring next year, the band announced Michael Angelo Batio as their touring guitarist for their upcoming 2023 \"Crushing The Enemies Of Metal\" Anniversary Tour.\n\nBand members\nTimeline\nThe Faceless Warrior\nThe Faceless Warrior, also known as the King of Metal, is the band's mascot. The character first appeared in 1988 on the cover of the album Kings Of Metal, and has since appeared in the cover artwork of almost every following Manowar album, as well as on merchandise and in almost every Manowar live show to follow.\nIn a May 2002 interview with Metal-Rules.com, vocalist Eric Adams was asked, \"Who is that guy in your album cover? Do you have any name for him?\". He replied, \"No because he is you, he is her, he is this person he is that person and so on. He has no face and that was in [sic] purpose because everyone needs a heroes [sic] in their life and our music is all about heroes and you know being the leader not the follower. It's picture [sic] of hero and you being that hero is that what it is all about. So there is no real name for it. It's a fantasy world man. Put your face there are you are the hero!\"\n\nThe Sign of the Hammer\n\"The Sign of the Hammer\" is a cultural gesture developed in the early years of the band, after the release of their fourth album of the same name, and serves as a signature of the band: It is formed by raising the right fist above the head, while using the left hand to grab the back of the right wrist. The sign is most likely to have been shaped from the vocalist Eric Adams. The Media Company \"Heilbronner Stimme\" published an article describing the Sign of the Hammer as, \"the striking greeting. A gesture that unites. A gesture that fits the pathos of the self-proclaimed Kings of Metal. A gesture that has become the trademark of the group founded in 1980\".\nThe first official appearance of the gesture was on the front cover of the band's fifth album, Fighting the World, where vocalist Eric Adams is shown making the gesture in a drawing of the band members.

It was to be an all-weather, carrier-based stealth bomber replacement for the Grumman A-6 Intruder in the United States Navy and Marine Corps. Its Avenger II name was taken from the Grumman TBF Avenger of World War II.\nThe development of the A-12 was troubled by cost overruns and several delays, causing questions of the program's ability to deliver upon its objectives; these doubts led to the development program's cancellation in 1991. The manner of its cancellation was contested through litigation until a settlement was reached in January 2014.\n\nDesign and development\nAdvanced Tactical Aircraft program\nThe United States Navy began the Advanced Tactical Aircraft (ATA) program in 1983. The program was to develop and field a replacement for the A-6 Intruder by 1994. Stealth technology developed for the United States Air Force would be used heavily in the program. Concept design contracts were awarded to the industry teams of McDonnell Douglas\/General Dynamics, and Northrop\/Grumman\/Vought in November 1984. The teams were awarded contracts for further concept development in 1986.\nThe General Dynamics\/McDonnell Douglas team was selected as the winner on 13 January 1988; the rival team led by Grumman surprisingly failed to submit a final bid. The General Dynamics\/McDonnell Douglas team was awarded a development contract and the ATA aircraft was designated A-12.  The first flight was initially planned for December 1990. The A-12 was named Avenger II in homage to the World War II-era Navy torpedo-bomber Grumman TBF Avenger.\nThe Navy initially sought to buy 620 A-12s and Marines wanted 238. In addition, the Air Force briefly considered ordering some 400 of an A-12 derivative. The A-12 was promoted as a possible replacement for the Air Force's General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark, and for the United Kingdom's Panavia Tornado fighter-bombers. The craft was a flying wing design in the shape of an isosceles triangle, with the cockpit situated near the apex of the triangle. The A-12 gained the nickname \"Flying Dorito\".\nThe aircraft was to be powered by two General Electric F412-D5F2 turbofan engines, each producing about 13,000 pounds-force (58 kN) of thrust. It was designed to carry precision guided weapons internally, up to two AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air missiles, two AGM-88 HARM air-to-ground missiles and a complement of air-to-ground ordnance, including unguided or precision-guided bombs, could be carried in an internal weapons bay. It has been claimed that the A-12 was to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons held in its internal weapons bay as well. The A-12 was to have a weapons load of 5,160 pounds (2,300 kg).\nBeginning in early 1990 General Dynamics and McDonnell Douglas revealed delays and projected cost increases. Due to late requirement changes to the aircraft impacting the composite design, aircraft weight had increased to 30% over design specification. This was unwelcome for an airplane that needed to operate efficiently and effectively from an aircraft carrier. Technical difficulties with the complexity of the radar system to be used also caused costs to increase; by one estimate the A-12 was to consume up to 70% of the Navy's budget for aircraft. After delays, its critical design review was successfully completed in October 1990 and the maiden flight was rescheduled to early 1992. In December 1990 plans were made for 14 Navy aircraft carriers to be equipped with a wing of 20 A-12s each.\nA government report released in November 1990 documented serious problems with the A-12 development program. In December 1990 Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney told the Navy to justify the program and deliver reasons why it should not be canceled. The response given by the Navy and the contractors failed to persuade the Secretary of Defense, as he canceled the program in the following month, on 7 January 1991, for breach of contract.\n\nThe government felt the contractors could not complete the program and instructed them to repay most of the $2 billion that had been spent on A-12 development. McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics disputed this in Federal Claims court. The reasons and causes for the cancellation have been debated and have been an issue of controversy.\n\nAftermath\nAfter the cancellation of the A-12, the Navy elected to purchase the F\/A-18E\/F Super Hornet, which went on to replace the A-6 Intruder and the F-14 Tomcat. The Super Hornet uses the General Electric F414 turbofan engine, which is a modified variant of the upgraded F404 version developed for the A-12. The full-size A-12 mockup was revealed to the public at the Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in June 1996. The cancellation of the A-12 is seen as one of the major losses in the 1990s that weakened McDonnell Douglas and led to its merger with rival Boeing in 1997. After years of being in storage at the Lockheed Martin Aeronautics (formerly General Dynamics) facility in Fort Worth, Texas, the mockup was transported to Veterans Memorial Air Park adjacent to Meacham Airport in north Fort Worth in June 2013. (The park was later renamed Fort Worth Aviation Museum.)\nThe manner in which the program was canceled led to years of litigation between the contractors and the Department of Defense over breach of contract (General Dynamics Corp. v. United States). On 1 June 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the U.S. Navy was justified in canceling the contract.  The ruling also required the two contractors to repay the U.S. government US$1.35 billion, plus interest charges of US$1.45 billion. Boeing, which had merged with McDonnell Douglas, and General Dynamics vowed to appeal the ruling. In September 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court said it would hear the two companies' arguments, that the government canceled the project improperly and that the use of the state secrets privilege by the U.S. prevented them from mounting an effective defense. In May 2011, the Supreme Court set aside the Appeals Court decision and returned the case to federal circuit court. In January 2014, the case was settled with Boeing and General Dynamics agreeing to pay $200 million each to the U.S. Navy.\n\nSpecifications (A-12 Avenger II)\nData from Stealth WarplanesGeneral characteristics\nCrew: 2\nLength: 37 ft 10 in (11.53 m)\nWingspan: 70 ft 3 in (21.41 m)\nWidth: 36 ft 3 in (11.05 m) wings folded\nHeight: 11 ft 3 in (3.43 m)\nWing area: 1,308 sq ft (121.5 m2)\nEmpty weight: 39,000 lb (17,690 kg)\nMax takeoff weight: 80,000 lb (36,287 kg)\nFuel capacity: 21,322 pounds (9,700 kg) (internal)\nPowerplant: 2 \u00d7 General Electric F412-GE-D5F2 turbofan engines, 13,000 lbf (58 kN) thrust each\nPerformance\n\nMaximum speed: 500 kn (580 mph, 930 km\/h)\nCombat range: 800 nmi (920 mi, 1,500 km)\nService ceiling: 40,000 ft (12,000 m)\nRate of climb: 5,000 ft\/min (25 m\/s)\nWing loading: 61 lb\/sq ft (300 kg\/m2)\nThrust\/weight: 0.325\nArmament\n\nPayload capability: 5,160 pounds (2,300 kg) in internal weapons bay including:\n2\u00d7 AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air missiles\n2\u00d7 AGM-88 HARM air-to-ground missiles\nUnguided or precision-guided bombs\n\nSee also\nNorthrop Grumman B-2 Spirit\nNorthrop Grumman X-47A Pegasus\n\nAircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era\n\nBoeing F\/A-18E\/F Super Hornet\nLockheed F-117 Nighthawk\nLockheed Martin F-22 Raptor\nLockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II\n\nRelated lists\n\nList of attack aircraft\nList of flying wing aircraft\nList of military aircraft of the United States\n\nReferences\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links\n\nA-12 Avenger II on GlobalSecurity.org\nA-12 Avenger II Mock-up photos on Fort Worth Star-Telegram.com","73":"Michael Bar-Zohar (Hebrew: \u05de\u05d9\u05db\u05d0\u05dc \u05d1\u05e8-\u05d6\u05d4\u05e8, born 30 January 1938) is an Israeli historian, novelist and politician. He was a member of the Knesset on behalf of the Alignment and Labor Party in the 1980s and early '90s.\n\nBiography\nBorn in Bulgaria, Bar-Zohar immigrated to Israel in 1948. He attended High School Heh in Tel Aviv and went on to study economics and international relations at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He also studied at the Institute of Political Science in the University of Paris, where he earned a PhD.\nHe became science editor for Davar, a weekly newspaper in 1958, but left the job the following year. Between 1960 and 1964 he wrote for LaMerhav, an Israeli newspaper in Paris. In 1967 he became a spokesman for the Israeli Ministry of Defense, and later lectured at the University of Haifa between 1970 and 1973.\n\nPolitical career\nBar-Zohar became involved in politics in the 1960s, and joined Rafi upon its foundation in 1965. Rafi merged into the Alignment in 1968, forming the Labor Party, with Bar-Zohar becoming a Labor Party member, eventually joining its central committee.\nHe was first elected to the Knesset in the 1981 elections on the Alignment's list and was a member of the Education and Culture Committee. Although he lost his seat in the 1984 election, he regained it in the 1988 elections, after which he was appointed chairman of the Education and Culture Committee. As a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Moshe Dayan, Bar-Zohar was known as a hawk within the Labor Party. He lost his seat in the 1992 election and did not return to the Knesset, despite running in Labor Party primaries in the 1990s. In 2008 he joined the new Yisrael Hazaka party formed by Ephraim Sneh, which failed to win a seat in the 2009 election.\n\nWritings\nIn 1965 Bar-Zohar won the Sokolov Award for his achievements as a journalist. He published several books, including biographies of David Ben-Gurion and Shimon Peres, several books about the Israeli security organizations, and an account of the rescue of Bulgarian Jews from the Nazis in World War II.\nBar-Zohar's book Mossad: The Great Operations (\u05d4\u05de\u05d5\u05e1\u05d3 - \u05d4\u05de\u05d1\u05e6\u05e2\u05d9\u05dd \u05d4\u05d2\u05d3\u05d5\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd), published in 2010 with Nissim Mishal, was the subject of an investigation by the newspaper Haaretz. According to the report, large parts of the book were copied from books and articles of journalist Ronen Bergman without acknowledgement. It even used fictitious names for an intelligence unit and an intelligence officer that Bergman had invented. Bar-Zohar and Mishal admitted to Haaretz that they had followed Bergman closely, but said it was in order to avoid trouble from the Israeli Military Censor. The three authors reached an agreement which included financial compensation for Bergman.  Bergman later claimed that Bar-Zohar and Mishal had violated the agreement, and he wrote to foreign publishers in an attempt to prevent publication of the international edition of Bar-Zohar and Mishal's book. In August 2013, Bar-Zohar and Mishal responded with a libel suit against Bergman. In November 2013, Bergman initiated a lawsuit against Bar-Zohar and Mishal, alleging plagiarism, intellectual property theft, defamation of character and more.\n\nPublished works\nA Bridge Over the Mediterranean: Franco-Israeli Relations Between 1947-1964 (1964)\nHunting for the German Scientists (1965)\nThe Longest Month (1965)\nThe Avengers (1968)\nThe Paratroopers Book (1969)\nThe Custodian: Isser Harel and the Adventures of the Shin Bet (1970)\nSpies in the promised land Houghton Mifflin (1972) ISBN 0-395-13641-5 ISBN 978-0395136416\nThe Third Truth Houghton Mifflin (1973) ISBN 0-395-15458-8 and in paperback under the name Michael Hastings by Collier\/Macmillan (1973) ISBN 0-02--043560-6 as part of the Collier Spymaster Series.\nThe Spy Who Died Twice Houghton Mifflin (1975) ISBN 0-395-19417-2\nBen Gurion: a biography (centennial edition).

Led by Abba Kovner, the group sought to kill six million Germans in a form of indiscriminate revenge, \"a nation for a nation\". Kovner went to Mandatory Palestine in order to secure large quantities of poison for poisoning water mains to kill large numbers of Germans. His followers infiltrated the water system of Nuremberg. However, Kovner was arrested upon arrival in the British zone of occupied Germany and had to throw the poison overboard. \nAfter this failure, Nakam turned their attention to \"Plan B\", targeting German prisoners of war held by the United States military in the American zone. They obtained arsenic locally and infiltrated the bakeries that supplied these prison camps. The conspirators poisoned 3,000 loaves of bread at Konsum-Genossenschaftsb\u00e4ckerei (Consumer Cooperative Bakery) in Nuremberg, which sickened more than 2,000 German prisoners of war at Langwasser internment camp. However, no known deaths can be attributed to the group. Although Nakam is considered by some to have been a terrorist organisation, German public prosecutors dismissed a case against two of its members in 2000 due to the \"unusual circumstances\".\n\nBackground\nDuring the Holocaust, Nazi Germany, its allies and collaborators murdered about six million Jews, by a variety of methods, including mass shootings and gassing. Many survivors, having lost their entire families and communities, had difficulty imagining a return to a normal life. The desire for revenge, either against Nazi war criminals or the entire German people, was widespread. From late 1942, as news of the Holocaust arrived in Mandatory Palestine, Jewish newspapers were full of calls for retribution. One of the leaders of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, Yitzhak Zuckerman, later said he \"didn't know a Jew who wasn't obsessed with revenge\". However, very few survivors acted on these fantasies, instead focusing on rebuilding their lives and communities and commemorating those who had perished. In all, Israeli historian Dina Porat estimates that about 200 or 250 Holocaust survivors attempted to exact violent revenge, of which Nakam was a significant portion. Including assassinations carried out by Mossad, these operations claimed the lives of as many as 1,000 to 1,500 people.\n\nFormation\nIn 1945, Abba Kovner, after visiting the site of the Ponary massacre and the extermination camp at Majdanek, and meeting survivors of Auschwitz in Romania, decided to take revenge. He recruited about 50 Holocaust survivors, mostly former Jewish partisans, but including a few who had escaped to the Soviet Union. Recruited for their ability to live undercover and not break down, most were in their early twenties and hailed from Vilnius, Rovno, Cz\u0119stochowa, or Krak\u00f3w. Generally known as Nakam (\"revenge\"), the organisation used the Hebrew name \u05d3\u05d9\u05df (Din, \"judgement\"), also an acronym of \u05d3\u05dd \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc \u05e0\u05d5\u05d8\u05e8 (Dam Yisrael Noter, \"the blood of Israel avenges\"). \nThe group's members believed that the defeat of Nazi Germany did not mean that Jews were safe from another Holocaust-level genocide. Kovner believed that a proportional revenge, killing six million Germans, was the only way to teach enemies of the Jews that they could not act with impunity: \"The act should be shocking. The Germans should know that after Auschwitz there can be no return to normality.\" According to survivors, Kovner's \"hypnotic\" eloquence put words to the emotions that they were feeling. Members of the group believed that the laws of the time were unable to adequately punish such an extreme event as the Holocaust and that the complete moral bankruptcy of the world could be cured only by catastrophic retributive violence. Porat hypothesises that Nakam was \"a necessary stage\" before the embittered survivors would be prepared \"to return to a life of society and laws\". \nThe group's leaders formed two plans: Plan A, to kill a large number of Germans, and Plan B, to poison several thousand SS prisoners held in US prisoner of war camps. From Romania Kovner's group traveled to Italy, where Kovner received a warm reception from Jewish Brigade soldiers who wanted him to help organise Aliyah Bet (illegal immigration to Mandate Palestine). Kovner refused because he was already set on revenge. Nakam developed a network of underground cells and immediately set out raising money, infiltrating German infrastructure, and securing poison. The group received a large supply of German-forged British currency from a Hashomer Hatzair emissary, forced speculators to contribute, and also obtained some money from sympathisers in the Jewish Brigade.\n\nPlan A (planned mass poisoning in Nuremberg)\nJoseph Harmatz, posing as a Polish displaced person (DP) named \"Maim Mendele\", attempted to infiltrate the municipal water supply in Nuremberg; Nakam targeted the city because it had been the stronghold of the Nazi Party. Harmatz had difficulty finding rooms for the conspirators to rent due to the housing shortage caused by the destruction of most of the city by Allied bombing. Through the use of bribes, he managed to place Willek Schwerzreich (Wilek Shinar), an engineer from Krak\u00f3w who spoke fluent German, in a position with the municipal water company. Schwarzreich obtained the plan of the water system and control of the main water valve, and plotted where the poison should be introduced so as to kill the largest possible number of Germans. In Paris, Pasha Reichman was in charge of a Nakam cell including Vitka Kempner, Kovner's future wife and former comrade in the Vilna Ghetto underground. Reichman reportedly spoke to David Ben-Gurion during the latter's trip to a DP camp in Germany, but the latter preferred to work towards Israeli independence than seek revenge for the Holocaust.\nIt fell to Kovner to obtain the poison from leaders in the Yishuv, the Jewish leadership in Mandatory Palestine. In July 1945, Kovner left the Jewish Brigade for Milan, disguising himself as a Jewish Brigade soldier on leave, and boarded a ship for Palestine the following month. Reichman became leader in Europe in his absence. Upon reaching Palestine, Kovner was held for three days in an apartment by the Mossad LeAliyah Bet and was personally interrogated by Mossad chief Shaul Meirov. Kovner negotiated with Haganah chiefs Moshe Sneh and Israel Galilee in hopes of convincing them to give him poison for a smaller revenge operation in return for not linking the murder to the Yishuv.\nIn September, Kovner informed Nakam in Europe that he had not had any success in locating poison, and therefore they should recruit Yitzhak Ratner, a chemist and former Vilna Ghetto insurgent, and focus on Plan B. Kovner was eventually introduced to Ephraim and Aharon Katzir, chemists at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, via one of their students who was a member of the Haganah. The Katzir brothers were sympathetic to Kovner's revenge plot and convinced the head of chemical storage at the Hebrew University to give him poison. Decades after the fact, Kovner claimed that he had pitched Plan B to Chaim Weizmann, then president of the World Zionist Organisation, who had directed him to the Katzir brothers. However, according to his biographer, if Kovner met Weizmann at all it was in February or March 1946, as Weizmann was out of the country before that.\nAfter several delays, Kovner travelled to Alexandria, Egypt, in December 1945 carrying false papers that identified him as a Jewish Brigade soldier returning from leave, and a duffel bag with gold hidden in toothpaste tubes and cans full of poison. Shortly after boarding a ship headed to Toulon, France, Kovner's name along with three others was called over the public address system. Kovner told a friend, Yitzik Rosenkranz, to convey the duffel bag to Kempner in Paris, and then threw half the poison overboard. After this, he turned himself in and was arrested by the British police. Nakam members later claimed that Kovner had been betrayed by the Haganah, but Porat writes that it is more likely that he was arrested as a suspected organiser of Aliyah Bet. Kovner, who spoke no English and had not attended the Jewish Brigade training, was not questioned about Nakam; after two months in jails in Egypt and Palestine, he was released. His involvement in Nakam ended at that time.\n\nPlan B (mass poisoning of SS prisoners)\nBecause Kovner had not managed to secure the quantity of poison required, the Nuremberg cell decided to switch to poisoning SS prisoners definitively during the first months of 1946. Most of the Nakam action groups disbanded as ordered and their members dispersed into displaced persons camps, promised by the leaders that in future they would be reactivated to implement Plan A. The cells in Nuremberg and Dachau remained active because of the large US prisoner of war camps nearby. Yitzhak Ratner was recruited into the group to obtain poison locally. In October 1945, he set up a laboratory in the Nakam headquarters in Paris, where he tested various formulations in order to find a tasteless, odorless poison that would have delayed effects. Ratner eventually formulated a mixture of arsenic, glue, and other additives which could be painted onto loaves of bread; tests on cats proved the lethality of the mixture. He obtained more than 18 kilograms (40 lb) of arsenic from friends who worked in the tanning industry, which was smuggled into Germany.\n\nNakam focused on Langwasser internment camp near Nuremberg (formerly Stalag XIII-D), where 12,000 to 15,000 prisoners, mainly former SS officers or prominent Nazis, were imprisoned by the United States. Initially, two Nakam members were hired by the camp, one as a driver, another as a storehouse worker. The bread for Langwasser came from a single bakery in Nuremberg, the Konsum-Genossenschaftsb\u00e4ckerei (Consumer Cooperative Bakery). Leipke Distel, a survivor of several Nazi concentration camps, posed as a Polish displaced person awaiting a visa to work at an uncle's bakery in Canada. He asked the manager if he could work for free and eventually secured access to the bakery storeroom after bribing him with cigarettes, alcohol, and chocolate. The Nakam operatives met each night in a rented room in F\u00fcrth to discuss their findings, especially how to confine their attack to the German prisoners and avoid harming the American guards. When Harmatz placed a few of the workers in clerical positions in the camp, they discovered that on Sundays, the black bread would be eaten only by the German prisoners because the American guards were specially issued white bread. Therefore, they decided to execute the attack on a Saturday night. \nSimilar preparations were made with regard to a prison camp near Dachau and the bakery supplying it, an effort led by Warsaw Ghetto uprising veteran Simcha Rotem. After becoming friends with Poles who worked in the bakery, Rotem got the manager drunk, made copies of his keys, and then returned them before he sobered up. A few days before the planned attack, Reichman received a tip-off from a Jewish intelligence officer in the United States Army that two of the operatives were wanted by the police. As ordered, the Dachau Nakam operatives aborted on 11 April 1946. Reichman feared that the failure of one attack would cause the United States to increase its security measures at prison camps, preventing a second attack.\nBy this time, six Nakam members worked at the Konsum-Genossenschaftsb\u00e4ckerei in Nuremberg. Subverting tight security aimed at preventing the theft of food, they smuggled the arsenic in over several days, hiding it under raincoats, and stashed it beneath the floorboards. Because experiments had shown that the arsenic mixture did not spread evenly, the operatives decided to paint it onto the bottom of each loaf. On Saturday 13 April, the bakery workers were on strike, delaying the Nakam operatives and preventing three of them from entering the bakery. As a result, Distel and his two accomplices had only enough time to poison some 3,000 loaves of bread instead of 14,000 as originally planned. After painting the loaves, they fled to Czechoslovakia, helped by an Auschwitz survivor named Yehuda Maimon, continuing on through Italy to southern France.\nOn 23 April 1946, The New York Times reported that 2,283 German prisoners of war had fallen ill from poisoning, with 207 hospitalized and seriously ill. However, the operation ultimately caused no known deaths. According to documents obtained by a Freedom of Information request to the National Archives and Records Administration, the amount of arsenic found in the bakery was enough to kill approximately 60,000 persons. It is unknown why the poisoners failed, but it is suspected to be either that they spread the poison too thinly, or else that the prisoners realised that the bread  had been poisoned and did not eat very much.\n\nAftermath and legacy\nAbout 30 former Nakam operatives boarded the ship Biriya on 23 June 1946 and arrived by the end of July following brief detention by the British authorities. They received a warm welcome at Kovner's kibbutz, Ein HaHoresh, from leading members of the Haganah and the Israeli Labor Party, and were invited to travel through the country. Although Kovner, and the majority of the operatives, considered that the time for revenge had passed, a small group led by Bolek Ben-Ya'akov returned to Europe to continue the mission. Nine other Nakam operatives broke away in the spring of 1947 and returned to Europe the following year, helped by Labor Party politician Abba Hushi.\nThe breakaway groups faced mounting challenges, both logistical and financial, and the foundation of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1949 made illegal operations even more difficult. Many of the members turned to a life of crime to support themselves, and then tried to escape from German jails with the help of former French Resistance members. Most returned to Israel between 1950 and 1952. Ben-Ya'akov said in an interview that he \"could not have looked at himself in the mirror\" if he had not tried to get revenge, and that he still deeply regretted that it did not succeed. After coming to Israel, former Nakam members refused to speak about their experiences for several decades, beginning to discuss the issue only in the 1980s. Porat writes that Kovner \"committed political suicide\" by participating in Nakam; she describes its failure as a \"miracle.\"  Members of the group showed no remorse, said that the Germans \"deserved it,\" and wanted recognition, rather than forgiveness, for their actions.\nIn 1999, Harmatz and Distel appeared in a documentary and discussed their role in Nakam. Distel maintained that Nakam's actions were moral and that the Jews \"had a right to revenge against the Germans.\" German prosecutors opened an investigation against them for attempted murder, but halted the preliminary investigation in 2000 because of the \"unusual circumstances.\" As of November 2019, four members of the group are reported to still be alive.\n\nHistoriography and popular culture\nAn early journalistic account of Nakam's mission is in Michael Bar-Zohar's 1969 book The Avengers. The story was given a fictionalised treatment in Forged in Fury by Michael Elkins in 1971. Jonathan Freedland's novel The Final Reckoning is based on the story. The story of Nakam has also entered German popular culture. In 2009, Daniel Kahn & the Painted Bird, a Germany-based klezmer band, recorded a song called \"Six Million Germans (Nakam)\". Based on tapes Kovner made on his deathbed describing his activities in Nakam, a television documentary was produced by Channel 4 for its Secret History series titled Holocaust \u2013 The Revenge Plot, which was first broadcast on Holocaust Memorial Day, 27 January 2018.\nAccording to Israeli counterterrorism experts Ehud Sprinzak and Idith Zertal, Nakam's worldview was similar to messianic groups or cults because of its belief that the world was so evil as to deserve large-scale catastrophe. Unlike most terrorist organisations which commit violence for political reasons and hope for a new, better future through terror, Nakam wanted to kill indiscriminately. The Nakam operatives came from \"heavily brutalized communities\" which, according to Sprinzak and Zertal, sometimes consider catastrophic violence.\nDina Porat is the first academic historian to systematically study the group, meeting with many of the survivors and gaining access to their private documents. She hypothesises that the failure of the attack may have been deliberate, as Kovner and other leaders began to realise that it could have greatly harmed the Jewish people. She struggled to reconcile the personalities of Nakam's members with the actions that they tried to carry out. When asked how he could plan an attack in which many innocent people would have been killed, one survivor explained that \"[i]f you had been there with me, at the end of the war, you wouldn't talk that way\". Porat's 2019 book on Nakam is titled Vengeance and Retribution Are Mine (\u05dc\u05d9 \u05e0\u05e7\u05dd \u05d5\u05e9\u05d9\u05dc\u05dd), a phrase from Deuteronomy which expresses her belief that the Jewish people are best to leave vengeance in the hands of the God of Israel.\nIn 2021, the film Plan A, directed and produced by Doron Paz and Yoav Paz, adapted the plot for cinema.\n\nSee also\nTilhas Tizig Gesheften\nGmul\n\nReferences\nBibliography\n\n\n== Further reading ==","75":"Outlaws is an American Western television series about lawmen pursuing criminals on the American frontier starring Barton MacLane, Don Collier, Jock Gaynor, Wynn Pearce, Bruce Yarnell, Slim Pickens, and Judy Lewis. The show aired on NBC during the 1960\u201361 and 1961\u201362 television seasons.\n\nSynopsis\nDuring Season 1 (1960\u201361), Outlaws depicted United States Marshal Frank Caine and his deputies Will Foreman and Heck Martin, lawmen on the American frontier during the 1870s, 1880s, and 1890s. Based in Guthrie in the Oklahoma Territory, they pursue outlaws across the territory. After the first nine episodes, Martin disappears from Caine\u2032s team and Deputy U.S. Marshal Steve Corbie replaces him. Rather than tell the story from the lawmen\u2032s point of view, each episode depicts events from the viewpoint of the outlaws they are trying to bring to justice, a darker perspective that explores how the outlaws think, what motivates them to break the law, how they plot their crimes, and how they feel about getting caught by lawmen.\nIn Season 2 (1961\u201362), Caine has become the territorial governor, and he, Martin, and Corbie are gone from the series. Still enforcing the law in the Oklahoma Territory, Foreman has been promoted to marshal and now is based in Stillwater, pursuing outlaws with the assistance of his own deputy, Chalk Breeson. Stories are told from the point of view of the lawmen and honest citizens rather than from that of the outlaws. Episodes also portray events in Stillwater, where Slim is the town character who sometimes assists the marshals and Connie Masters works at the Wells Fargo office.\nOutlaws sought greater historical accuracy than most television Westerns, depicting real-life outlaws such as the Dalton Gang, Bill Doolin, and Sam Bass and events such as the Land Rush of 1889 in some of its episodes.\n\nCast\nBarton MacLane...U.S. Marshal Frank Caine (1960\u20131961)\nDon Collier...Deputy U.S. Marshal Will Foreman (1960\u20131961)\/U.S. Marshal Will Foreman (1961\u20131962)\nJock Gaynor...Deputy U.S. Marshal Heck Martin (1960 \u2013 9 episodes)\nWynn Pearce...Deputy U.S. Marshal Steve Corbie (1960\u20131961 \u2013 17 episodes)\nBruce Yarnell...Deputy U.S. Marshal Chalk Breeson (1961\u20131962)\nSlim Pickens...Slim (1961\u20131962)\nJudy Lewis...Connie Masters (1961\u20131962)\n\nProduction\nOutlaws was filmed at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Paramount Pictures and Frank Telford served as its executive producer.

They were part of the German heavy\/speed\/power metal scene which emerged in the early to mid-1980s, and have been referred to as one of the country's so-called \"big four\" of power metal, along with Grave Digger, Helloween and Running Wild.\nRage was formed in 1984 under the name Avenger. After releasing their debut album Prayers of Steel and their Depraved to Black EP in 1985, the band changed their name to Rage because there was another band in England that shared the same name. 17 musicians have been part of Rage over the years, with the most successful line-up being from the period now known as the Refuge years; this line-up featured Manni Schmidt and Chris Efthimiadis. The second notable line-up was the one formed with Mike Terrana and Victor Smolski.\nThrough the years, Rage established themselves as a notably successful band and as pioneers of the power metal scene, including in their music elements of progressive metal and classical music. In 1996, Rage was one of the first metal bands to write and record an album with a full symphonic orchestra: Lingua Mortis.\nRage has released 27 albums (counting the \"Avenger\" and \"LMO\" releases) over the past 30 years (in total more than 50 releases counting DVDs, EPs, Japan editions, and VHS). A remarkable international success with more than five million records sold, Rage has had more than 40 music chart entries.\n\nHistory\nFrom Avenger to Rage (1984\u20131986)\nRage began in 1984 in Herne when Peavy Wagner (bass and vocals), along with drummer J\u00f6rg Michael and guitarist Jochen Schroeder, first got together under the name \"Avenger\". Following the arrival of their debut album recorded in 1984, Prayers of Steel released by Wishbone Records, followed by an EP Depraved to Black in August 1985, Avenger changed their name and became Rage, and got a record deal at Noise, releasing their first official LP, Reign of Fear, on 12 May 1986.\n\nNoise years (1986\u20131994)\nOn 11 May 1987 they released the album Execution Guaranteed under the label Noise. In the same year they released their first official video clip \"Down by Law\", introducing the new line-up with Manni Schmidt and Chris Efthimiadis.\nWith this new line-up in 1988 the album Perfect Man was released, having as a single the song \"Don't Fear the Winter\", which became a hit in the scene. The band began touring with Running Wild, U.D.O., Mot\u00f6rhead and Saxon. In 1989 Rage released the album Secrets in a Weird World, hitting the charts with the single \"Invisible Horizons\", also a highlight in the career of the band.\nThe early 1990s, their 1992 album Trapped! marked their international breakthrough, hitting the charts worldwide. As a result, the band performed their first major tour in Japan.\nTheir success was repeated in 1993 with the release of The Missing Link. This Album turned out to become one of the most successful and influential albums of this era.\nIn early 1994, the guitarist Manni Schmidt left the band and Peavy Wagner formed a new line-up with Sven Fischer and Chris Efthimiadis's brother Spiros.\n\nTwo guitars years (1994\u20131999)\nAfter the change in their lineup, in 1994 Rage went on to record their ten-year anniversary album called 10 Years in Rage, which was the last album released by Noise Records, which was not well promoted by the media. Rage signed with Gun Records the same year and released the breakthrough album Black in Mind, followed by a world tour and several chart entries worldwide. Especially in Japan and Europe, this album brought the band to a different, much higher level and is still seen as a classic of the genre. Several bands had simultaneously left Gun Records that year.  \nThe album Lingua Mortis, recorded in 1996, was the first album on which a metal act collaborated with a classical symphonic orchestra. Their material was performed live for the first time in late summer 1996 in Kufstein, Austria. Subsequently, Rage and the orchestra embarked on a Christmas tour and played several European festivals.\nStill in 1996, they launched one of the most successful albums of their career, End of All Days, With \"Higher than the Sky\" becoming a staple of their live shows.\nIn March 1998 Rage released their thirteenth album XIII, which included the Lingua Mortis Orchestra and had considerable success in the charts. XIII was ranked number 272 in Rock Hard magazine's book of The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time.\nAfter the album XIII, in 1999 Rage continued working with the Lingua Mortis Orchestra for their next album Ghosts. Shortly before the release of the album, the band went through a major line-up change. Peavy Wagner reformed Rage once again and the former members formed the pop band Sub7even.\n\nThe millennium years (1999\u20132015)\nPeavy recruited the new members Victor Smolski on guitar and Mike Terrana on drums. The trio performed first at Wacken Open Air in August 1999, and released their Album Welcome to the Other Side in 2001. In the following two years, the albums Unity and Soundchaser were released with positive response from critics. Rage toured with Primal Fear in 2002 and Helloween in 2003. The band's 20th anniversary in 2004 was celebrated by the From the Cradle to the Stage tour, where the show in Bochum was recorded and released under the same name on CD and DVD in 2005.\n\nIn 2006, Rage again featured a symphonic orchestra, this time from Minsk, Belarus, named \"Lingua Mortis Orchestra\", that performed on their following album Speak of the Dead. It was the last album with Mike Terrana on drums. On 1 January 2007 it was announced that the new drummer would be Andr\u00e9 Hilgers, formerly the drummer of Axxis. He was already featured on the 20th anniversary album Into the Light of Nuclear Blast, which was composed, produced and mainly played by Victor, and its lyrics were written by Peavy.\nIn 2007, the band toured throughout Europe with the orchestra, and their performance at Wacken Open Air in August in front of 80,000 fans was recorded for a DVD to be included as a bonus to their next album. Carved in Stone was released on 22 February 2008. In 2009, the band played at the Bundesvision Song Contest 2009 on 13 February, which was hosted by Stefan Raab (TV total), where they reached third place. Their participating song Gib dich nie auf (Never Give Up) was released on an EP. That year was also the occasion for a 25th anniversary tour, and their Wacken performance\u2014together with guest musicians like Hansi K\u00fcrsch\u2014was released on a bonus DVD of the 2011 album Strings to a Web.\nRage entered the studio in October 2011 to begin the recordings of their 21st album, appropriately named 21, for an early 2012 release. Two years later, for the band's 30th anniversary, The Soundchaser Archives, was released, featuring rare and demo songs from the last 30 years of the band. An anniversary tour was performed throughout the entire year and ended in January 2015 with their last show in Sofia.\nOn 4 February 2015, Peavy Wagner announced that there would not be any further cooperation with Victor Smolski and Andr\u00e9 Hilgers.\nMeanwhile, Peavy renewed contact with his ex-band members Manni Schmidt and Christos Efthimiadis, and played a secret concert in Peavy's hometown Herne under the pseudonym Tres Hombres. After this success they have decided to play again together as Refuge, and confirmed several festival dates for 2015.\n\nPresent years (2015\u2013present)\nThe new line-up was announced on 18 June 2015, featuring guitarist Marcos Rodriguez (from the band Soundchaser) and drummer Vassilios \"Lucky\" Maniatopoulos (vocalist and percussionist of the band Tri State Corner and also a former drum technician and apprentice of Chris Efthimiadis). After the EP My Way in January 2016, their album, The Devil Strikes Again, was released on 10 June 2016. A tour was scheduled for the end of the year, followed on 28 July 2017 by another album, Seasons of the Black. The next tour took place in January 2018 with Firewind as special guest.\nThe 25th studio album Wings of Rage was announced in April 2019, and released in January 2020. On 6 May 2020 Marcos Rodriguez left the band due to personal and private reasons, replaced by Stefan Weber (ex Axxis) and Jean Bormann (Angelinc).\nRage's 26th studio album, Resurrection Day, was released on 17 September 2021. On 24 July 2023 it was announced, that Weber goes on indefinite hiatus due to personal issues, and the band continues as trio.\nRage's 27th studio album, Afterlifelines, was released on 29 March 2024. The album also marks as the first in their history to be a double album, and the first new symphonic songs since the departure of Smolski.\n\nSide projects\nLingua Mortis Orchestra\nThe Lingua Mortis Orchestra (LMO) is the name associated with the orchestras who played with Rage since 1996 on the albums or on stage. Rage's tenth studio album, Lingua Mortis was the first classical album by a metal act, and a collaboration with the Prague Symphony Orchestra.  Later, Rage worked with the orchestras in some of the band's most known albums, such as in XIII and Ghosts. In 2006, an orchestra from Minsk, Belarus, that was also named Lingua Mortis Orchestra, recorded with Rage the Speak of the Dead album, and on the next year, Rage did 2007 several shows with the Lingua Mortis Orchestra, and their performance at Wacken Open Air was recorded as a bonus DVD for their next album, Carved in Stone.\nIn 2011, it was formed as a side project by the Rage musicians Peavy Wagner (vocals and bass), Victor Smolski (guitar and keyboard) and Andr\u00e9 Hilgers (drums) as a continuation of 1996's Lingua Mortis album, back then a true piece of pioneering work. They recorded in 2013 the debut album along with Rage LMO, with two orchestras from Spain and Belarus. The album features Metalium's ex-vocalist Henning Basse, Jeannette Marchewka and Dana Harnge as additional vocalists.\nThe first symphonic shows under the band's name have taken place at the 70000 Tons of Metal festival, followed by several summer festivals, among them Wacken and\u2014still before the album's release\u2014Masters of Rock. The last one was also recorded, and included as a bonus DVD of The Soundchaser Archives.\nAt this point, the Lingua Mortis Orchestra name as a \"side project\" was turn down by Peavy himself and became part of the band as it was originally done back in 1996. For 2019, Rage toured with the Lingua Mortis Orchestra to perform some festival shows and performed the entire XIII album. The 2024 Afterlifelines also contains symphonic songs, and the band has scheduled some shows with orchestra as part of the 40th anniversary.\n\n\"Equals to Rage, LMO is an important part of me and I will put in the same amount of passion and creative energy as I have done in the past.\"\n\nRefuge\nIn 2014, Peavy Wagner reunited with Manni Schmidt and Chris Efthimiadis, and they decided to play a secret show in their hometown, Herne, under the name \"Tres Hombres\". From there came the idea of the creation of Refuge, with the same Rage line-up from 1988 to 1993. The name Refuge came from one of the most known songs by Rage, \"Refuge\" from the album The Missing Link, which was recorded by the same line-up. Peavy said in an interview that Refuge is not a professional band as the band members have their regular jobs and families, so Refuge is more like an \"extended hobby\" for playing special events and festivals. Peavy also said Refuge would still be co-existing with Rage and the new line-up with Marcos and Vassilios.\nIn 2015, Refuge played in many festivals around Europe, including the Rock Hard Festival, which was broadcast live, and was also recorded as a new live album, Live at Rock Hard Festival for the boxset The Refuge Years.\nThe band's first album, Solitary Men, was released on 8 June 2018.\n\nBand members\nCurrent members\nPeavy Wagner \u2013 bass, lead vocals (1984\u2013present)\nVassilios \"Lucky\" Maniatopoulos \u2013 drums, backing vocals (2015\u2013present)\nJean Bormann \u2013 guitars, backing vocals (2020\u2013present)\nStefan Weber \u2013 guitars (2020\u2013present; hiatus since 2023)\n\nFormer members\nJochen Schroeder \u2013 lead guitar (1984\u20131987, died 2021)\nAlf Meyerratken \u2013 rhythm guitar (1984)\nThomas Gr\u00fcning \u2013 rhythm guitar (1985\u20131986)\nJ\u00f6rg Michael \u2013 drums (1984\u20131987)\nRudy Graf \u2013 rhythm guitar (1986\u20131987)\nManni Schmidt \u2013 lead guitar (1987\u20131994)\nChris Efthimiadis \u2013 drums (1987\u20131999)\nSven Fischer \u2013 rhythm guitar (1993\u20131999)\nSpiros Efthimiadis \u2013 lead guitar (1994\u20131999)\nVictor Smolski \u2013 guitars, keyboards (1999\u20132015)\nMike Terrana \u2013 drums (1999\u20132007)\nAndr\u00e9 Hilgers \u2013 drums (2007\u20132015)\nMarcos Rodriguez \u2013 guitars, backing vocals (2015\u20132020)\n\nTimeline\nDiscography\nStudio albums\nPrayers of Steel (as Avenger) (1985)\nReign of Fear (1986)\nExecution Guaranteed (1987)\nPerfect Man (1988)\nSecrets in a Weird World (1989)\nReflections of a Shadow (1990)\nTrapped!

Vengeful forms of justice, such as primitive justice or retributive justice, are often differentiated from more formal and refined forms of justice such as distributive justice or restorative justice.\n\nFunction in society\nSocial psychologist Ian Mckee states that the desire for the sustenance of power motivates vengeful behavior as a means of impression management: \"People who are more vengeful tend to be those who are motivated by power, by authority and by the desire for status. They don't want to lose face\".\nVengeful behavior has been found across a majority of human societies throughout history. Some societies encourage vengeful behavior, which is then called a feud. These societies usually regard the honor of individuals and groups as of central importance. Thus, while protecting  their reputation, an avenger feels as if they restore the previous state of dignity and justice. According to Michael Ignatieff, \"Revenge is a profound moral desire to keep faith with the dead, to honor their memory by taking up their cause where they left off\". Thus, honor may become a heritage that passes from generation to generation. Whenever it is compromised, the affected family or community members might feel compelled to retaliate against an offender to restore the initial \"balance of honor\" that preceded the perceived injury. This cycle of honor might expand by bringing the family members and then the entire community of the new victim into the brand-new, endless cycle of revenge that may pervade generations.\n\nHistory\nFrancis Bacon described revenge as a kind of \"wild justice\" that \"does [..]. offend the law [and] putteth the law out of office.\"\nFeuds are cycles of provocation and retaliation, fueled by a desire for revenge and carried out over long periods of time by familial or tribal groups. They were an important part of many pre-industrial societies, especially in the Mediterranean region. They still persist in some areas, notably in Albania with its tradition of gjakmarrja or \"blood feuds\", revenge that is carried out not only by the individual, but by their extended relations for generations to come.\nBlood feuds are still practised in many parts of the world, including Kurdish regions of Turkey and in Papua New Guinea.\nIn Japan, honouring one's family, clan, or lord through the practice of revenge killings is called \"katakiuchi\" (\u6575\u8a0e\u3061). These killings could also involve the relatives of an offender. Today, katakiuchi is most often pursued by peaceful means, but revenge remains an important part of Japanese culture.\n\nSocial psychology\nPhilosophers tend to believe that to punish and to take revenge are vastly different activities: \"One who undertakes to punish rationally does not do so for the sake of the wrongdoing, which is now in the past - but for the sake of the future, that the wrongdoing shall not be repeated, either by him, or by others who see him, or by others who see him punished\". In contrast, seeking revenge is motivated by a yearning to see a transgressor suffer; revenge is necessarily preceded by anger, whereas punishment does not have to be.\nIndeed, Kaiser, Vick, and Major point out the following: \"An important psychological implication of the various efforts to define revenge is that\nthere is no objective standard for declaring an act to be motivated by revenge or not.\nRevenge is a label that is ascribed based on perceivers\u2019 attributions for the act. Revenge\nis an inference, regardless of whether the individuals making the inference are the harmdoers themselves, the injured parties, or outsiders. Because revenge is an inference, various individuals can disagree on whether the same action is revenge or not.\"\nBelief in the just-world fallacy is also associated with revenge: in particular, having strong experiences or challenges against, can increase distress and motivate individuals to seek revenge, as a means of justice restoration.\nA growing body of research reveals that a vengeful disposition is correlated to adverse health outcomes: strong desires for revenge and greater willingness to act on these desires have been correlated with post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms and psychiatric morbidity.\n\nProverbs\nThe popular expression \"revenge is a dish best served cold\" suggests that revenge is more satisfying if enacted when unexpected or long-feared, inverting traditional civilized revulsion toward \"cold-blooded\" violence.\nThe idea's origin is obscure. The French diplomat Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord (1754\u20131838) has been credited with the saying, \"La vengeance est un met que l'on doit manger froid\" [\"Revenge is a dish that must be eaten cold\"], albeit without supporting detail. The concept has been in the English language at least since the 1846 translation of the 1845 French novel Mathilde by Joseph Marie Eug\u00e8ne Sue: \"la vengeance se mange tr\u00e8s bien froide\", there italicized as if quoting a proverbial saying, and translated \"revenge is very good eaten cold\". The phrase has been wrongly credited to the novel Les Liaisons Dangereuses (1782).\nThe phrase has also been credited to the Pashtuns of Afghanistan.\nEarlier speakers of English might use the set phrase \"with a wanion\" rather than the more modern standard \"with a vengeance\" to express intensity.\nA Japanese proverb states, \"If you want revenge, then dig two graves\". While this reference is frequently misunderstood by Western audiences, the Japanese reader understands that this proverb means that enactors of revenge must be more dedicated to killing their enemy than to surviving the ordeal themselves.\n\nIn art\nRevenge is a popular subject across many forms of art. Some examples include the painting Herodias' Revenge by Juan de Flandes and the operas Don Giovanni and The Marriage of Figaro, both by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.  In Japanese art, revenge is a theme in various woodblock prints depicting the forty-seven r\u014dnin by many well-known and influential artists, including Utagawa Kuniyoshi. The Chinese playwright Ji Junxiang used revenge as the central theme in his theatrical work The Orphan of Zhao; it depicts more specifically familial revenge, which is placed in the context of Confucian morality and social hierarchical structure.\n\nIn literature\nRevenge has been a popular literary theme historically and continues to play a role in contemporary works. Examples of literature that feature revenge as a theme include the plays Hamlet and Othello by William Shakespeare, the novel The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas, and the short story \"The Cask of Amontillado\" by Edgar Allan Poe. More modern examples include the novels Carrie by Stephen King, Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn, and The Princess Bride by William Goldman. Although revenge is a theme in itself, it is also considered to be a genre.\nRevenge as a genre has been consistent with a variety of themes that have frequently appeared in different texts over the last few centuries. Such themes include but are not limited to: disguise, masking, sex, cannibalism, the grotesque, bodily fluids, power, violent murders, and secrecy. Each theme is usually coupled with the concept of dramatic irony. Dramatic irony is a literary device in which the audience possesses knowledge unavailable to characters in a novel, play, or film. Its purpose is to intensify the tragic events that are going to unfold by creating tension between the audience and the actions of the characters.\nThe most common theme within the genre of revenge is the recurring violent murders that take place throughout the text, especially in the final act or scene. The root of the violence is usually derived from the characters' childhood development.\nThe themes of masking and disguise have the ability to go hand in hand with each other. A character may employ disguise literally or metaphorically. A mask is the literal example of this theme; while pretending to be something one is not is considered to be the metaphoric example. Additional themes that may cause the protagonist and antagonist to develop a masked or disguised identity include sex, power, and even cannibalism. Examples of sex and power being used as themes can be seen in the novel Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn, as well as the aforementioned drama, Titus Andronicus.\n\nOn the internet\nThe emergence of the internet has provided new ways of exacting revenge. Customer revenge targets businesses and corporations with the intent to cause damage or harm. In general, people tend to place more credence in online reviews rather than corporate communications. With technology becoming more readily available, corporations and firms are more likely to experience damage caused by negative reviews posted online going viral. Recent studies indicate this type of consumer rage aimed at corporations is becoming more common, especially in Western societies.\nThe rise of social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube act as public platforms for exacting new forms of revenge. Revenge porn involves the vengeful public dissemination of intimate pictures and videos of another person's sexual activity with the intent of creating widespread shame. Participation in online revenge porn activities incites a sense of pleasure through the harm, embarrassment, and humiliation being inflicted on the victim. The allowance of anonymity on revenge porn sites encourages further incivility by empowering and encouraging this type of behavior. In many instances, the original poster provides the victim's personal information, including links to social media accounts, furthering the harassment. Online revenge porn's origins can be traced to 2010 when Hunter Moore created the first site, IsAnyoneUp, to share nude photos of his girlfriend.\n\nIn animals\nHumans are not the only species known to take revenge. There are several species such as camels, elephants, fish, lions, coots, crows, and many species of primates (chimpanzees, macaques, baboons, etc.) that have been recognized to seek revenge. Primatologists Frans de Waal and Lesleigh Luttrellave conducted numerous studies that provide evidence of revenge in many species of primates. They observed chimpanzees and noticed patterns of revenge. For example, if chimpanzee A helped chimpanzee B defeat his opponent, chimpanzee C, then chimpanzee C would be more likely to help chimpanzee A's opponent in a later squabble. Chimpanzees are one of the most common species that show revenge due to their desire for dominance. Studies have also been performed on less cognitive species such as fish to demonstrate that not only intellectual animals execute revenge. Studies of crows by Professor John Marzluff have also shown that some animals can carry \"blood feuds\" in similar ways to humans. Using a \"dangerous\" mask to cover their face and trap, band, and then release crows, Marzluff observed that within two weeks, a significant percentage of crows encountered - 26%, to be exact - would \"scold\" the people wearing the dangerous mask, proving that crows pass information pertaining to feuds within their family units to spread awareness about dangers they may face. This included crows not initially trapped by the mask-wearing researchers, seeing as some of the crows were un-banded. This was further proven three years after the initial study, as the percentage of \"scolding\" crows increased to 66% from the initial 26%.\n\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nRachel Stein. 2019.

He is considered to be among the greatest and most influential filmmakers of all time.\nAt age 21, Welles was directing high-profile stage productions for the Federal Theatre Project in New York City\u2014starting with a celebrated 1936 adaptation of Macbeth with an African-American cast, and ending with the controversial labor opera The Cradle Will Rock in 1937. He and John Houseman then founded the Mercury Theatre, an independent repertory theatre company that presented a series of productions on Broadway through 1941, including a modern, politically charged Caesar (1937). In 1938, his radio anthology series The Mercury Theatre on the Air gave Welles the platform to find international fame as the director and narrator of a radio adaptation of H. G. Wells's novel The War of the Worlds, which caused some listeners to believe that a Martian invasion was in fact occurring. The event rocketed 23-year-old Welles to notoriety.\nHis first film was Citizen Kane (1941), which he co-wrote, produced, directed, and starred in as the title character, Charles Foster Kane. It has been consistently ranked as one of the greatest films ever made. He directed twelve other features, the most acclaimed of which include The Magnificent Ambersons (1942), The Stranger (1946), The Lady from Shanghai (1947), Touch of Evil (1958), The Trial (1962), Chimes at Midnight (1966), and F for Fake (1973). Welles also had roles in other directors' films, notably Rochester in Jane Eyre (1943), Harry Lime in The Third Man (1949), and Cardinal Wolsey in A Man for All Seasons (1966).\nHis distinctive directorial style featured layered and nonlinear narrative forms, dramatic lighting, unusual camera angles, sound techniques borrowed from radio, deep focus shots and long takes. He has been praised as \"the ultimate auteur\".:\u200a6\u200a Welles was an outsider to the studio system and struggled for creative control on his projects early on with the major film studios in Hollywood and later in life with a variety of independent financiers across Europe, where he spent most of his career. Many of his films were either heavily edited or remained unreleased.\nWelles received an Academy Award and three Grammy Awards among other numerous honors such as the Academy Honorary Award in 1970, the Golden Lion in 1970, the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1975, and the British Film Institute Fellowship in 1983. In 2002, he was voted the greatest film director of all time in two British Film Institute polls among directors and critics. In 2018, he was included in the list of the 50 greatest Hollywood actors of all time by The Daily Telegraph. \nWelles had three marriages, including one with Rita Hayworth, and three children.\nMiche\u00e1l Mac Liamm\u00f3ir, who worked with the 16-year-old Welles on the stage in Dublin and later played Iago in his film  Othello, wrote that \"Orson's courage, like everything else about him, imagination, egotism, generosity, ruthlessness, forbearance, impatience, sensitivity, grossness and vision is magnificently out of proportion.\":\u200axxxvii\n\nEarly life (1915\u20131931)\nGeorge Orson Welles was born May 6, 1915, in Kenosha, Wisconsin, a son of Richard Head Welles (1872\u20131930):\u200a26\u200a and Beatrice Ives Welles (n\u00e9e Beatrice Lucy Ives; 1883\u20131924).:\u200a9\u200a He was named after one of his great-grandfathers, influential Kenosha attorney Orson S. Head, and his brother George Head.:\u200a37\u200a\nDespite his family's affluence, Welles encountered hardship in childhood. His parents separated and moved to Chicago in 1919. His father, who made a fortune as the inventor of a popular bicycle lamp, became an alcoholic and stopped working. Welles's mother was a concert pianist who had studied with the Polish-born pianist-composer Leopold Godowsky. She played during lectures by Dudley Crafts Watson at the Art Institute of Chicago to support her son and herself. As a boy, Welles received piano and violin lessons arranged by his mother. The older Welles boy, \"Dickie\", was institutionalized at an early age because he had learning difficulties. Beatrice died of hepatitis in a Chicago hospital on May 10, 1924, just after Welles's ninth birthday.:\u200a3\u20135\u200a:\u200a326\u200a The Gordon String Quartet, a predecessor to the Berkshire String Quartet, which had made its first appearance at her home in 1921, played at Beatrice's funeral.\nAfter his mother's death, Welles ceased pursuing a musical career. It was decided that he would spend the summer with the Watson family at a private art colony established by Lydia Avery Coonley Ward in the village of Wyoming in the Finger Lakes Region of New York.:\u200a8\u200a There, he played and became friends with the children of the Aga Khan, including the 12-year-old Prince Aly Khan. Then, in what Welles later described as \"a hectic period\" in his life, he lived in a Chicago apartment with both his father and Maurice Bernstein, a Chicago physician who had been a close friend of both his parents. Welles briefly attended public school:\u200a133\u200a before his alcoholic father left business altogether and took him along on his travels to Jamaica and the Far East. When they returned, they settled in a hotel in Grand Detour, Illinois, that was owned by his father. When the hotel burned down, Welles and his father took to the road again.:\u200a9\u200a\n\"During the three years that Orson lived with his father, some observers wondered who took care of whom,\" wrote biographer Frank Brady.:\u200a9\u200a\n\n\"In some ways, he was never really a young boy, you know,\" said Roger Hill (1895\u20131990), who became Welles's teacher and lifelong friend.:\u200a24\u200a\n\nWelles briefly attended public school in Madison, Wisconsin, enrolled in the fourth grade.:\u200a9\u200a On September 15, 1926, he entered the Todd Seminary for Boys,:\u200a3\u200a an expensive independent school in Woodstock, Illinois, that his older brother, Richard Ives Welles, had attended ten years before until he was expelled for misbehavior.:\u200a48\u200a At Todd School, Welles came under the influence of Roger Hill, a teacher who was later Todd's headmaster. Hill provided Welles with an ad hoc educational environment that proved invaluable to his creative experience, allowing Welles to concentrate on subjects that interested him. Welles performed and staged theatrical experiments and productions there.\n\n\"Todd provided Welles with many valuable experiences,\" wrote critic Richard France. \"He was able to explore and experiment in an atmosphere of acceptance and encouragement. In addition to a theatre, the school's own radio station was at his disposal.\":\u200a27\u200a Welles's first radio experience was on the Todd station, where he performed an adaptation of Sherlock Holmes that was written by him.:\u200a7\u200a\nOn December 28, 1930, when Welles was 15, his father died of heart and kidney failure at the age of 58, alone in a hotel in Chicago. Shortly before this, Welles had told his father that he refused to see him until he stopped drinking. Welles suffered lifelong guilt and despair that he was unable to express. \"That was the last I ever saw of him,\" Welles told biographer Barbara Leaming 53 years later. \"I've never, never ... I don't want to forgive myself.\":\u200a32\u201333,\u200a463\u200a His father's will left it to Welles to name his guardian. When Roger Hill declined, he chose Dr. Maurice Bernstein,:\u200a71\u201372\u200a a physician and friend of the family.\nFollowing graduation from Todd in May 1931,:\u200a3\u200a Welles was awarded a scholarship to Harvard College, while his mentor Roger Hill advocated he attend Cornell College in Iowa. Instead, Welles chose travel. He studied for a few weeks at the Art Institute of Chicago:\u200a117\u200a with Boris Anisfeld, who encouraged him to pursue painting.:\u200a18\u200a\nWelles occasionally returned to Woodstock, the place he eventually named when he was asked in a 1960 interview, \"Where is home?\" Welles replied, \"I suppose it's Woodstock, Illinois, if it's anywhere. I went to school there for four years. If I try to think of a home, it's that.\"\n\nEarly career (1931\u20131935)\nAfter his father's death, Welles traveled to Europe using a small portion of his inheritance. Welles said that while on a walking and painting trip through Ireland, he strode into the Gate Theatre in Dublin and claimed he was a Broadway star. The manager of the Gate, Hilton Edwards, later said he had not believed him but was impressed by his brashness and an impassioned audition he gave.:\u200a134\u200a Welles made his stage debut at the Gate Theatre on October 13, 1931, appearing in Ashley Dukes's adaptation of Jud S\u00fc\u00df as Duke Karl Alexander of W\u00fcrttemberg. He performed small supporting roles in subsequent Gate productions, and he produced and designed productions of his own in Dublin. In March 1932, Welles performed in W. Somerset Maugham's The Circle at Dublin's Abbey Theatre and traveled to London to find additional work in the theatre. Unable to obtain a work permit, he returned to the U.S.:\u200a327\u2013330\u200a\nWelles found his fame ephemeral and turned to a writing project at Todd School that became immensely successful, first entitled Everybody's Shakespeare, for the first three volumes, and subsequently, The Mercury Shakespeare. In Spring 1933, Welles traveled via the SS Exermont, a tramp steamer, writing the introduction for the books, while onboard ship, after landing at Morocco, he stayed as the guest of Thami El Glaoui, in the Atlas mountains surrounding Tangier while working on thousands of illustrations for the Everybody's Shakespeare series of educational books, a series that remained in print for decades.\n\nIn 1933, Hortense and Roger Hill invited Welles to a party in Chicago, where Welles met Thornton Wilder. Wilder arranged for Welles to meet Alexander Woollcott in New York in order that he be introduced to Katharine Cornell, who was assembling a theatre company for a seven-month transcontinental repertory tour. Cornell's husband, director Guthrie McClintic, immediately put Welles under contract and cast him in three plays.:\u200a46\u201349\u200a Romeo and Juliet, The Barretts of Wimpole Street and Candida began touring in repertory in November 1933, with the first of more than 200 performances taking place in Buffalo, New York.:\u200a330\u2013331\u200a\n\nIn 1934, Welles got his first job on radio\u2014with The American School of the Air\u2014through actor-director Paul Stewart, who introduced him to director Knowles Entrikin.:\u200a331\u200a That summer, Welles staged a drama festival with the Todd School at the Opera House in Woodstock, Illinois, inviting Miche\u00e1l Mac Liamm\u00f3ir and Hilton Edwards from Dublin's Gate Theatre to appear along with New York stage luminaries in productions including Trilby, Hamlet, The Drunkard and Tsar Paul. At the old firehouse in Woodstock, he also shot his first film, an eight-minute short titled The Hearts of Age.:\u200a330\u2013331\u200a\nOn November 14, 1934, Welles married Chicago socialite and actress Virginia Nicolson:\u200a332\u200a (often misspelled \"Nicholson\") in a civil ceremony in New York. To appease the Nicolsons, who were furious at the couple's elopement, a formal ceremony took place December 23, 1934, at the New Jersey mansion of the bride's godmother. Welles wore a cutaway borrowed from his friend George Macready.:\u200a182\u200a\nA revised production of Katharine Cornell's Romeo and Juliet opened December 20, 1934, at the Martin Beck Theatre in New York.:\u200a331\u2013332\u200a The Broadway production brought the 19-year-old Welles to the notice of John Houseman, a theatrical producer who was casting the lead role in the debut production of one of Archibald MacLeish's verse plays, Panic.:\u200a144\u2013158\u200a On March 22, 1935, Welles made his debut on the CBS Radio series The March of Time, performing a scene from Panic for a news report on the stage production.:\u200a70\u201371\u200a\nBy 1935, Welles was supplementing his earnings in the theatre as a radio actor in Manhattan, working with many actors who later formed the core of his Mercury Theatre on programs including America's Hour, Cavalcade of America, Columbia Workshop and The March of Time.:\u200a331\u2013332\u200a \"Within a year of his debut Welles could claim membership in that elite band of radio actors who commanded salaries second only to the highest paid movie stars,\" wrote critic Richard France.:\u200a172\n\nTheatre (1936\u20131938)\nFederal Theatre Project\nPart of the Works Progress Administration, the Federal Theatre Project (1935\u20131939) was a New Deal program to fund theatre and other live artistic performances and entertainment programs in the United States during the Great Depression. It was created as a relief measure to employ artists, writers, directors and theatre workers. Under national director Hallie Flanagan it was shaped into a truly national theatre that created relevant art, encouraged experimentation and innovation, and made it possible for millions of Americans to see live theatre for the first time.\n\nJohn Houseman, director of the Negro Theatre Unit in New York, invited Welles to join the Federal Theatre Project in 1935. Far from unemployed\u2014\"I was so employed I forgot how to sleep\"\u2014Welles put a large share of his $1,500-a-week radio earnings into his stage productions, bypassing administrative red tape and mounting the projects more quickly and professionally. \"Roosevelt once said that I was the only operator in history who ever illegally siphoned money into a Washington project,\" Welles said.:\u200a11\u201313\u200a\nThe Federal Theatre Project was the ideal environment in which Welles could develop his art. Its purpose was employment, so he was able to hire any number of artists, craftsmen and technicians, and he filled the stage with performers.:\u200a3\u200a The company for the first production, an adaptation of William Shakespeare's Macbeth with an entirely African-American cast, numbered 150. The production became known as the Voodoo Macbeth because Welles changed the setting to a mythical island suggesting the Haitian court of King Henri Christophe,:\u200a179\u2013180\u200a with Haitian vodou fulfilling the role of Scottish witchcraft.:\u200a86\u200a The play opened April 14, 1936, at the Lafayette Theatre in Harlem and was received rapturously. At 20, Welles was hailed as a prodigy. The production then made a 4,000-mile national tour:\u200a333\u200a that included two weeks at the Texas Centennial Exposition in Dallas.\n\nNext mounted was the farce Horse Eats Hat, an adaptation by Welles and Edwin Denby of The Italian Straw Hat, an 1851 five-act farce by Eug\u00e8ne Marin Labiche and Marc-Michel.:\u200a114\u200a The play was presented September 26 \u2013 December 5, 1936, at Maxine Elliott's Theatre, New York,:\u200a334\u200a and featured Joseph Cotten in his first starring role.:\u200a34\u200a It was followed by an adaptation of Dr. Faustus that used light as a prime unifying scenic element in a nearly black stage, presented January 8 \u2013 May 9, 1937, at Maxine Elliott's Theatre.:\u200a335\u200a\nOutside the scope of the Federal Theatre Project,:\u200a100\u200a American composer Aaron Copland chose Welles to direct The Second Hurricane (1937), an operetta with a libretto by Edwin Denby. Presented at the Henry Street Settlement Music School in New York for the benefit of high school students, the production opened April 21, 1937, and ran its scheduled three performances.:\u200a337\u200a\n\nIn 1937, Welles rehearsed Marc Blitzstein's political opera, The Cradle Will Rock. It was originally scheduled to open June 16, 1937, in its first public preview. Because of cutbacks in the WPA projects, the show's premiere at the Maxine Elliott Theatre was canceled. The theater was locked and guarded to prevent any government-purchased materials from being used for a commercial production of the work. In a last-minute move, Welles announced to waiting ticket-holders that the show was being transferred to the Venice, 20 blocks away. Some cast, and some crew and audience, walked the distance on foot. The union musicians refused to perform in a commercial theater for lower non-union government wages. The actors' union stated that the production belonged to the Federal Theatre Project and could not be performed outside that context without permission. Lacking the participation of the union members, The Cradle Will Rock began with Blitzstein introducing the show and playing the piano accompaniment on stage with some cast members performing from the audience. This impromptu performance was well received by its audience.\n\nMercury Theatre\nBreaking with the Federal Theatre Project in 1937, Welles and Houseman founded their own repertory company, which they called the Mercury Theatre. The name was inspired by the title of the iconoclastic magazine The American Mercury.:\u200a119\u2013120\u200a Welles was executive producer, and the original company included such actors as Joseph Cotten, George Coulouris, Geraldine Fitzgerald, Arlene Francis, Martin Gabel, John Hoyt, Norman Lloyd, Vincent Price, Stefan Schnabel and Hiram Sherman.\n\"I think he was the greatest directorial talent we've ever had in the [American] theater\", Lloyd said of Welles in a 2014 interview. \"When you saw a Welles production, you saw the text had been affected, the staging was remarkable, the sets were unusual, music, sound, lighting, a totality of everything. We had not had such a man in our theater. He was the first and remains the greatest.\"\nThe Mercury Theatre opened November 11, 1937, with Caesar, Welles's modern-dress adaptation of Shakespeare's tragedy Julius Caesar\u2014streamlined into an anti-fascist tour de force that Joseph Cotten later described as \"so vigorous, so contemporary that it set Broadway on its ear.\":\u200a108\u200a The set was completely open with no curtain, and the brick stage wall was painted dark red. Scene changes were achieved by lighting alone.:\u200a165\u200a On the stage was a series of risers; squares were cut into one at intervals and lights, designed by Jean Rosenthal, were set beneath it, pointing straight up to evoke the \"cathedral of light\" at the Nuremberg Rallies. \"He staged it like a political melodrama that happened the night before,\" said Lloyd.\nBeginning January 1, 1938, Caesar was performed in repertory with The Shoemaker's Holiday; both productions moved to the larger National Theatre. They were followed by Heartbreak House (April 29, 1938) and Danton's Death (November 5, 1938).:\u200a344\u200a As well as being presented in a pared-down oratorio version at the Mercury Theatre on Sunday nights in December 1937, The Cradle Will Rock was at the Windsor Theatre for 13 weeks (January 4 \u2013 April 2, 1938).:\u200a340\u200a Such was the success of the Mercury Theatre that Welles appeared on the cover of Time magazine, in full makeup as Captain Shotover in Heartbreak House, in the issue dated May 9, 1938\u2014three days after his 23rd birthday.\n\nRadio (1936\u20131940)\nSimultaneously with his work in the theatre, Welles worked extensively in radio as an actor, writer, director and producer, often without credit.:\u200a77\u200a Between 1935 and 1937 he was earning as much as $2,000 a week, shuttling between radio studios at such a pace that he would arrive barely in time for a quick scan of his lines before he was on the air. While he was directing the Voodoo Macbeth Welles was dashing between Harlem and midtown Manhattan three times a day to meet his radio commitments.:\u200a172\u200a\nIn addition to continuing as a repertory player on The March of Time, in the fall of 1936 Welles adapted and performed Hamlet in an early two-part episode of CBS Radio's Columbia Workshop. His performance as the announcer in the series' April 1937 presentation of Archibald MacLeish's verse drama The Fall of the City was an important development in his radio career:\u200a78\u200a and made the 21-year-old Welles an overnight star.:\u200a46\u200a\nIn July 1937, the Mutual Network gave Welles a seven-week series to adapt Les Mis\u00e9rables. It was his first job as a writer-director for radio,:\u200a338\u200a the debut of the Mercury Theatre, and one of Welles's earliest and finest achievements.:\u200a160\u200a He invented the use of narration in radio.:\u200a88\u200a\n\"By making himself the center of the storytelling process, Welles fostered the impression of self-adulation that was to haunt his career to his dying day\", wrote critic Andrew Sarris. \"For the most part, however, Welles was singularly generous to the other members of his cast and inspired loyalty from them above and beyond the call of professionalism.\":\u200a8\u200a\nThat September, Mutual chose Welles to play Lamont Cranston, also known as The Shadow. He performed the role anonymously through mid-September 1938.:\u200a83\n\nThe Mercury Theatre on the Air\nAfter the theatrical successes of the Mercury Theatre, CBS Radio invited Orson Welles to create a summer show for 13 weeks. The series began July 11, 1938, initially titled First Person Singular, with the formula that Welles would play the lead in each show. Some months later the show was called The Mercury Theatre on the Air.:\u200a12\u200a The weekly hour-long show presented radio plays based on classic literary works, with original music composed and conducted by Bernard Herrmann.\nThe Mercury Theatre's radio adaptation of The War of the Worlds by H. G. Wells October 30, 1938, brought Welles instant fame. The combination of the news bulletin form of the performance with the between-breaks dial-spinning habits of listeners was later reported to have created widespread confusion among listeners who failed to hear the introduction, although the extent of this confusion has come into question. Panic was reportedly spread among listeners who believed the fictional news reports of a Martian invasion. The myth of the result created by the combination was reported as fact around the world and disparagingly mentioned by Adolf Hitler in a public speech.\n\nWelles's growing fame drew Hollywood offers, lures that the independent-minded Welles resisted at first. The Mercury Theatre on the Air, which had been a sustaining show (without sponsorship) was picked up by Campbell Soup and renamed The Campbell Playhouse. The Mercury Theatre on the Air made its last broadcast on December 4, 1938, and The Campbell Playhouse began five days later.\nWelles began commuting from California to New York for the two Sunday broadcasts of The Campbell Playhouse after signing a film contract with RKO Pictures in August 1939. In November 1939, production of the show moved from New York to Los Angeles.:\u200a353\u200a\nAfter 20 shows, Campbell began to exercise more creative control and had complete control over story selection. As his contract with Campbell came to an end, Welles chose not to sign on for another season. After the broadcast of March 31, 1940, Welles and Campbell parted amicably.:\u200a221\u2013226\n\nHollywood (1939\u20131948)\nRKO Radio Pictures president George Schaefer eventually offered Welles what generally is considered the greatest contract offered to a filmmaker, much less to one who was untried. Engaging him to write, produce, direct and perform in two motion pictures, the contract subordinated the studio's financial interests to Welles's creative control, and broke all precedent by granting Welles the right of final cut.:\u200a1\u20132\u200a After signing a summary agreement with RKO on July 22, Welles signed a full-length 63-page contract August 21, 1939.:\u200a353\u200a The agreement was bitterly resented by the Hollywood studios and persistently mocked in the trade press.:\u200a2\n\nCitizen Kane\nRKO rejected Welles's first two movie proposals,:\u200a3\u201315\u200a but agreed on the third offer\u2014Citizen Kane. Welles co-wrote, produced and directed the film, and he performed the lead role. Welles conceived the project with screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, who was writing radio plays for The Campbell Playhouse.:\u200a16\u200a Mankiewicz based the original outline of the film script on the life of William Randolph Hearst, whom he knew and came to hate after being exiled from Hearst's circle.:\u200a231\u200a\nAfter agreeing on the storyline and character, Welles supplied Mankiewicz with 300 pages of notes and put him under contract to write the first-draft screenplay under the supervision of John Houseman. Welles wrote his own draft,:\u200a54\u200a then drastically condensed and rearranged both versions and added scenes of his own. The industry accused Welles of underplaying Mankiewicz's contribution to the script, but Welles countered the attacks by saying, \"At the end, naturally, I was the one making the picture, after all\u2014who had to make the decisions. I used what I wanted of Mank's and, rightly or wrongly, kept what I liked of my own.\":\u200a54\u200a\nWelles's project attracted some of Hollywood's best technicians, including cinematographer Gregg Toland. For the cast, Welles primarily used actors from his Mercury Theatre. Filming Citizen Kane took ten weeks. Welles called Toland \"the greatest gift any director\u2014young or old\u2014could ever, ever have. And he never tried to impress on us that he was performing miracles. He just went ahead and performed them. I was calling on him to do things only a beginner could be ignorant enough to think anybody could ever do, and there he was, doing them.\"\nThe film was scored by Bernard Herrmann, who had worked with Welles in radio. Welles said he worked with Hermann on the score \"very intimately.\"\nHearst's newspapers barred all reference to Citizen Kane and exerted enormous pressure on the Hollywood film community to force RKO to shelve the film.:\u200a111\u200a RKO chief George Schaefer received a cash offer from MGM's Louis B. Mayer and other major studio executives if he would destroy the negative and existing prints of the film.:\u200a112\u200a\n\nWhile waiting for Citizen Kane to be released, Welles produced and directed the original Broadway production of Native Son, a drama written by Paul Green and Richard Wright based on Wright's novel. Starring Canada Lee, the show ran March 24 \u2013 June 28, 1941, at the St. James Theatre. The Mercury Production was the last time Welles and Houseman worked together.:\u200a12\u200a\nCitizen Kane was given a limited release and the film received overwhelming critical praise. It was voted the best picture of 1941 by the National Board of Review and the New York Film Critics Circle. The film garnered nine Academy Award nominations but won only for Best Original Screenplay, shared by Mankiewicz and Welles. Variety reported that block voting by screen extras deprived Citizen Kane of Oscars for Best Picture and Best Actor (Welles), and similar prejudices were likely to have been responsible for the film receiving no technical awards.:\u200a117\u200a\nThe delay in the film's release and uneven distribution contributed to mediocre results at the box office. After it ran its course theatrically, Citizen Kane was retired to the vault in 1942. In postwar France, however, the film's reputation grew after it was seen there for the first time in 1946.:\u200a117\u2013118\u200a In the United States, it began to be re-evaluated after it appeared on television in 1956. That year it was also re-released theatrically,:\u200a119\u200a and film critic Andrew Sarris described it as \"the great American film\" and \"the work that influenced the cinema more profoundly than any American film since The Birth of a Nation.\" Citizen Kane is now widely hailed as one of the greatest films ever made. From 1962 to 2012, it topped the decennial Sight and Sound poll of the Greatest Films of All Time.\n\nThe Magnificent Ambersons\n\"The fate of The Magnificent Ambersons is one of film history's great tragedies,\" wrote film historian Robert L. Carringer.:\u200a1\u200a It was Welles's second film for RKO, adapted by Welles from Booth Tarkington's Pulitzer Prize-winning 1918 novel about the declining fortunes of a wealthy Midwestern family and the social changes brought by the automobile age. Toland was unavailable, so Stanley Cortez was named cinematographer. The meticulous Cortez worked slowly and the film lagged behind schedule and over budget. In contract renegotiations with RKO over a film he was obliged to direct, Welles had conceded his right to control the final cut.\n\nThe Magnificent Ambersons was in production October 28, 1941 \u2013 January 22, 1942, with a cast including Joseph Cotten, Dolores Costello, Anne Baxter, Tim Holt, Agnes Moorehead and Ray Collins. RKO chief George Schaefer understood that presenting a downbeat period film without marquee stars was a risk for the studio, but he was reassured by a special screening of the film-in-progress that Welles arranged for him on November 28. Schaefer was an expert in film distribution, and attended to the marketing strategy personally.:\u200a1\u200a \nRequired to start filming the \"Carnaval\" segment of It\u2019s All True in early February 1942, Welles rushed to edit The Magnificent Ambersons and finish his acting scenes in Journey into Fear. He ended his lucrative CBS radio show:\u200a189\u200a February 2, flew to Washington, D.C., for a briefing, and then lashed together a rough cut of Ambersons in Miami with editor Robert Wise.:\u200a369\u2013370\u200a \nA finished 131-minute version of the movie, edited per Welles's detailed instructions, was previewed March 17, 1942, in Pomona. Schaefer was present, and he was rattled by the audience response: 75 percent of the preview cards were negative. The film was received more favorably by a preview audience in the more upscale Pasadena on March 19, with only 25 percent of the preview cards negative. But the experience led Schaefer to authorize the studio to make whatever changes necessary to make The Magnificent Ambersons a commercial success.:\u200a1\u20132\u200a\nWise, whom Welles had left in charge of postproduction, removed nearly 50 minutes of footage from Welles's cut, and several scenes \u2014 including the ending \u2014 were rewritten and reshot. Over Welles's opposition, The Magnificent Ambersons was cut to run 88 minutes.:\u200a2\u200a Like the film itself, Bernard Herrmann's score was heavily edited by RKO. When more than half of his score was removed from the soundtrack and replaced by music by Roy Webb, Herrmann bitterly severed his ties with the film and promised legal action if his name was not removed from the credits.\nEven in its released form, The Magnificent Ambersons is considered one of the best films of all time. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and it was added to the National Film Registry in 1991.\n\nJourney into Fear\nAt RKO's request, Welles worked on an adaptation of Eric Ambler's spy thriller Journey into Fear, co-written with Joseph Cotten. In addition to acting in the film, Welles was the producer. Direction was credited to Norman Foster. Welles later said that they were in such a rush that the director of each scene was determined by whoever was closest to the camera.:\u200a165\u200a Journey into Fear was in production January 6 \u2013 March 12, 1942.\n\nWar work\nGoodwill ambassador\nIn late November 1941, Welles was appointed as a goodwill ambassador to Latin America by Nelson Rockefeller, U.S. Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs and a principal stockholder in RKO Radio Pictures.:\u200a244\u200a The mission of the OCIAA was cultural diplomacy, promoting hemispheric solidarity and countering the growing influence of the Axis powers in Latin America.:\u200a10\u201311\u200a John Hay Whitney, head of the agency's Motion Picture Division, was asked by the Brazilian government to produce a documentary of the annual Rio Carnival celebration taking place in early February 1942.:\u200a40\u201341\u200a In a telegram on December 20, 1941, Whitney wrote Welles, \"Personally believe you would make great contribution to hemisphere solidarity with this project.\":\u200a65\u200a\nThe OCIAA sponsored cultural tours to Latin America and appointed goodwill ambassadors including George Balanchine and the American Ballet, Bing Crosby, Aaron Copland, Walt Disney, John Ford and Rita Hayworth. Welles was thoroughly briefed in Washington, D.C., immediately before his departure for Brazil, and film scholar Catherine L. Benamou, a specialist in Latin American affairs, finds it \"not unlikely\" that he was among the goodwill ambassadors who were asked to gather intelligence for the U.S. government in addition to their cultural duties. She concludes that Welles's acceptance of Whitney's request was \"a logical and patently patriotic choice\".:\u200a245\u2013247\u200a\nIn addition to working on his ill-fated film It's All True, Welles was responsible for radio programs, lectures, interviews and informal talks as part of his OCIAA-sponsored cultural mission, which was regarded as a success.:\u200a192\u200a He spoke on topics ranging from Shakespeare to visual art at gatherings of Brazil's elite, and his two intercontinental radio broadcasts in April 1942 were particularly intended to tell U.S. audiences that President Vargas was a partner with the Allies. Welles's ambassadorial mission was extended to permit his travel to other nations including Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay.:\u200a247\u2013249,\u200a328\u200a Welles worked for more than half a year with no compensation.:\u200a41,\u200a328\u200a:\u200a189\u200a\nWelles's own expectations for the film were modest. \"It's All True was not going to make any cinematic history, nor was it intended to,\" he later said. \"It was intended to be a perfectly honorable execution of my job as a goodwill ambassador, bringing entertainment to the Northern Hemisphere that showed them something about the Southern one.\":\u200a253\n\nIt's All True\nIn July 1941, Welles conceived It's All True as an omnibus film mixing documentary and docufiction:\u200a221\u200a:\u200a27\u200a in a project that emphasized the dignity of labor and celebrated the cultural and ethnic diversity of North America. It was to have been his third film for RKO, following Citizen Kane (1941) and The Magnificent Ambersons (1942).:\u200a109\u200a Duke Ellington was put under contract to score a segment with the working title, \"The Story of Jazz\", drawn from Louis Armstrong's 1936 autobiography, Swing That Music.:\u200a232\u2013233\u200a Armstrong was cast to play himself in the brief dramatization of the history of jazz performance, from its roots to its place in American culture in the 1940s.:\u200a109\u200a \"The Story of Jazz\" was to go into production in December 1941.:\u200a119\u2013120\u200a\nMercury Productions purchased the stories for two other segments\u2014\"My Friend Bonito\" and \"The Captain's Chair\"\u2014from documentary filmmaker Robert J. Flaherty.:\u200a33,\u200a326\u200a Adapted by Norman Foster and John Fante, \"My Friend Bonito\" was the only segment of the original It's All True to go into production.:\u200a109\u200a Filming took place in Mexico September\u2013December 1941, with Norman Foster directing under Welles's supervision.:\u200a311\u200a\nIn December 1941, the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs asked Welles to make a film in Brazil that would showcase the Carnaval in Rio de Janeiro.:\u200a65\u200a With filming of \"My Friend Bonito\" about two-thirds complete, Welles decided he could shift the geography of It's All True and incorporate Flaherty's story into an omnibus film about Latin America\u2014supporting the Roosevelt administration's Good Neighbor policy, which Welles strongly advocated.:\u200a41,\u200a246\u200a In this revised concept, \"The Story of Jazz\" was replaced by the story of samba, a musical form with a comparable history and one that came to fascinate Welles. He also decided to do a ripped-from-the-headlines episode about the epic voyage of four poor Brazilian fishermen, the jangadeiros, who had become national heroes. Welles later said this was the most valuable story.:\u200a158\u2013159\u200a:\u200a15\u200a\nRequired to film the Carnaval in Rio de Janeiro in early February 1942, Welles rushed to edit The Magnificent Ambersons and finish his acting scenes in Journey into Fear. He ended his lucrative CBS radio show:\u200a189\u200a February 2, flew to Washington, D.C., for a briefing, and then lashed together a rough cut of Ambersons in Miami with editor Robert Wise.:\u200a369\u2013370\u200a Welles recorded the film's narration the night before he left for South America: \"I went to the projection room at about four in the morning, did the whole thing, and then got on the plane and off to Rio\u2014and the end of civilization as we know it.\":\u200a115\u200a\nWelles left for Brazil on February 4 and began filming in Rio on February 8, 1942.:\u200a369\u2013370\u200a At the time it did not seem that Welles's other film projects would be disrupted, but as film historian Catherine L. Benamou wrote, \"the ambassadorial appointment would be the first in a series of turning points leading\u2014in 'zigs' and 'zags,' rather than in a straight line\u2014to Welles's loss of complete directorial control over both The Magnificent Ambersons and It's All True, the cancellation of his contract at RKO Radio Studio, the expulsion of his company Mercury Productions from the RKO lot, and, ultimately, the total suspension of It's All True.:\u200a46\u200a\nIn 1942 RKO Pictures underwent major changes under new management. Nelson Rockefeller, the primary backer of the Brazil project, left its board of directors, and Welles's principal sponsor at RKO, studio president George Schaefer, resigned. RKO took control of Ambersons and edited the film into what the studio considered a commercial format. Welles's attempts to protect his version ultimately failed. In South America, Welles requested resources to finish It's All True. Given a limited amount of black-and-white film stock and a silent camera, he was able to finish shooting the episode about the jangadeiros, but RKO refused to support further production on the film.\n\"So I was fired from RKO,\" Welles later recalled. \"And they made a great publicity point of the fact that I had gone to South America without a script and thrown all this money away. I never recovered from that attack.\":\u200a188\u200a Later in 1942, when RKO Pictures began promoting its new corporate motto, \"Showmanship In Place of Genius: A New Deal at RKO\", Welles understood it as a reference to him.:\u200a188\n\nRadio (1942\u20131943)\nWelles returned to the United States August 22, 1942, after more than six months in South America.:\u200a372\u200a A week after his return he produced and emceed the first two hours of a seven-hour coast-to-coast War Bond drive broadcast titled I Pledge America. Airing August 29, 1942, on the Blue Network, the program was presented in cooperation with the United States Department of the Treasury, Western Union (which wired bond subscriptions free of charge) and the American Women's Voluntary Services. Featuring 21 dance bands and a score of stage and screen and radio stars, the broadcast raised more than $10 million\u2014more than $146 million today\u2014for the war effort.\nOn October 12, 1942, Cavalcade of America presented Welles's radio play, Admiral of the Ocean Sea, an entertaining and factual look at the legend of Christopher Columbus.\n\"It belongs to a period when hemispheric unity was a crucial matter and many programs were being devoted to the common heritage of the Americas,\" wrote broadcasting historian Erik Barnouw. \"Many such programs were being translated into Spanish and Portuguese and broadcast to Latin America, to counteract many years of successful Axis propaganda to that area. The Axis, trying to stir Latin America against Anglo-America, had constantly emphasized the differences between the two. It became the job of American radio to emphasize their common experience and essential unity.\":\u200a3\u200a\nAdmiral of the Ocean Sea, also known as Columbus Day, begins with the words, \"Hello Americans\"\u2014the title Welles would choose for his own series five weeks later.:\u200a373\u200a\n\nHello Americans, a CBS Radio series broadcast November 15, 1942 \u2013 January 31, 1943, was produced, directed and hosted by Welles under the auspices of the Office of the Coordinator for Inter-American Affairs. The 30-minute weekly program promoted inter-American understanding and friendship, drawing upon the research amassed for the ill-fated film, It's All True. The series was produced concurrently with Welles's other CBS series, Ceiling Unlimited (November 9, 1942 \u2013 February 1, 1943), sponsored by the Lockheed-Vega Corporation. The program was conceived to glorify the aviation industry and dramatize its role in World War II. Welles's shows were regarded as significant contributions to the war effort.:\u200a64\u200a\nThroughout the war Welles worked on patriotic radio programs including Command Performance, G.I. Journal, Mail Call, Nazi Eyes on Canada, Stage Door Canteen and Treasury Star Parade.\n\nThe Mercury Wonder Show\nIn early 1943, the two concurrent radio series (Ceiling Unlimited, Hello Americans) that Orson Welles created for CBS to support the war effort had ended. Filming also had wrapped on the 1943 film adaptation of Jane Eyre and that fee, in addition to the income from his regular guest-star roles in radio, made it possible for Welles to fulfill a lifelong dream. He approached the War Assistance League of Southern California and proposed a show that evolved into a big-top spectacle, part circus and part magic show. He offered his services as magician and director,:\u200a40\u200a and invested some $40,000 of his own money in an extravaganza he co-produced with his friend Joseph Cotten: The Mercury Wonder Show for Service Men. Members of the U.S. armed forces were admitted free of charge, while the general public had to pay.:\u200a26\u200a The show entertained more than 1,000 service members each night, and proceeds went to the War Assistance League, a charity for military service personnel.\n\nThe development of the show coincided with the resolution of Welles's oft-changing draft status in May 1943, when he was finally declared 4-F\u2014unfit for military service\u2014for a variety of medical reasons. \"I felt guilty about the war,\" Welles told biographer Barbara Leaming. \"I was guilt-ridden about my civilian status.\":\u200a86\u200a He had been publicly hounded about his patriotism since Citizen Kane, when the Hearst press began persistent inquiries about why Welles had not been drafted.:\u200a66\u201367\u200a\n\nThe Mercury Wonder Show ran August 3 \u2013 September 9, 1943, in an 80-by-120-foot tent located at 900 Cahuenga Boulevard, in the heart of Hollywood.:\u200a377\u200a:\u200a26\u200a At intermission on September 7, 1943, KMPC radio interviewed audience and cast members of The Mercury Wonder Show\u2014including Welles and Rita Hayworth, who were married earlier that day. Welles remarked that The Mercury Wonder Show had been performed for approximately 48,000 members of the U.S. armed forces.:\u200a378\u200a:\u200a129\n\nRadio (1944\u20131945)\nThe idea of doing a radio variety show occurred to Welles after his success as substitute host of four consecutive episodes (March 14 \u2013 April 4, 1943) of The Jack Benny Program, radio's most popular show, when Benny contracted pneumonia on a performance tour of military bases.:\u200a368\u200a A half-hour variety show broadcast January 26 \u2013 July 19, 1944, on the Columbia Pacific Network, The Orson Welles Almanac presented sketch comedy, magic, mindreading, music and readings from classic works. Many of the shows originated on U.S. military camps, where Welles and his repertory company and guests entertained the troops with a reduced version of The Mercury Wonder Show.:\u200a64\u200a The performances of the all-star jazz group Welles brought together for the show were so popular that the band became a regular feature and was an important force in reviving interest in traditional New Orleans jazz.:\u200a85\u200a\nWelles was placed on the U.S. Treasury payroll on May 15, 1944, as an expert consultant for the duration of the war, with a retainer of $1 a year. On the recommendation of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau asked Welles to lead the Fifth War Loan Drive, which opened June 12 with a one-hour radio show on all four networks, broadcast from Texarkana, Texas. Including a statement by the President, the program defined the causes of the war and encouraged Americans to buy $16 billion in bonds to finance the Normandy landings and the most violent phase of World War II. Welles produced additional war loan drive broadcasts on June 14 from the Hollywood Bowl, and June 16 from Soldier Field, Chicago.:\u200a371\u2013373\u200a Americans purchased $20.6 billion in War Bonds during the Fifth War Loan Drive, which ended on July 8, 1944.\n\nWelles campaigned ardently for Roosevelt in 1944. A longtime supporter and campaign speaker for FDR, he occasionally sent the president ideas and phrases that were sometimes incorporated into what Welles characterized as \"less important speeches\".:\u200a372,\u200a374\u200a One of these ideas was the joke in what came to be called the Fala speech, Roosevelt's nationally broadcast September 23 address to the International Teamsters Union which opened the 1944 presidential campaign.:\u200a292\u2013293\u200a\nWelles campaigned for the Roosevelt\u2013Truman ticket almost full-time in the fall of 1944, traveling to nearly every state:\u200a373\u2013374\u200a to the detriment of his own health:\u200a293\u2013294\u200a and at his own expense.:\u200a219\u200a In addition to his radio addresses he filled in for Roosevelt, opposite Republican presidential nominee Thomas E. Dewey, at The New York Herald Tribune Forum broadcast October 18 on the Blue Network.:\u200a386\u200a:\u200a292\u200a Welles accompanied FDR to his last campaign rally, speaking at an event November 4 at Boston's Fenway Park before 40,000 people,:\u200a294\u200a and took part in a historic election-eve campaign broadcast November 6 on all four radio networks.:\u200a387\u200a:\u200a166\u2013167\u200a\nOn November 21, 1944, Welles began his association with This Is My Best, a CBS radio series he would briefly produce, direct, write and host (March 13 \u2013 April 24, 1945). He wrote a political column called Orson Welles' Almanac (later titled Orson Welles Today) for The New York Post January\u2013November 1945, and advocated the continuation of FDR's New Deal policies and his international vision, particularly the establishment of the United Nations and the cause of world peace.:\u200a84\u200a\nOn April 12, 1945, the day Franklin D. Roosevelt died, the Blue-ABC network marshalled its entire executive staff and national leaders to pay homage to the late president. \"Among the outstanding programs which attracted wide attention was a special tribute delivered by Orson Welles\", reported Broadcasting magazine. Welles spoke at 10:10 p.m Eastern War Time, from Hollywood, and stressed the importance of continuing FDR's work: \"He has no need for homage and we who loved him have no time for tears ... Our fighting sons and brothers cannot pause tonight to mark the death of him whose name will be given to the age we live in.\"\nWelles presented another special broadcast on the death of Roosevelt the following evening: \"We must move on beyond mere death to that free world which was the hope and labor of his life.\":\u200a390\u200a:\u200a242\u200a\nHe dedicated the April 17 episode of This Is My Best to Roosevelt and the future of America on the eve of the United Nations Conference on International Organization.:\u200a390\u200a Welles was an advisor and correspondent for the Blue-ABC radio network's coverage of the San Francisco conference that formed the UN, taking place April 24 \u2013 June 23, 1945. He presented a half-hour dramatic program written by Ben Hecht on the opening day of the conference, and on Sunday afternoons (April 29 \u2013 June 10) he led a weekly discussion from the San Francisco Civic Auditorium.\n\nThe Stranger\nIn the fall of 1945 Welles began work on The Stranger (1946), a film noir drama about a war crimes investigator who tracks a high-ranking Nazi fugitive to an idyllic New England town. Edward G. Robinson, Loretta Young and Welles star.\nProducer Sam Spiegel initially planned to hire director John Huston, who had rewritten the screenplay by Anthony Veiller. When Huston entered the military, Welles was given the chance to direct and prove himself able to make a film on schedule and under budget:\u200a19\u200a\u2014something he was so eager to do that he accepted a disadvantageous contract. One of its concessions was that he would defer to the studio in any creative dispute.:\u200a379\u200a:\u200a309\u2013310\u200a\nThe Stranger was Welles's first job as a film director in four years.:\u200a391\u200a He was told that if the film was successful he could sign a four-picture deal with International Pictures, making films of his own choosing.:\u200a379\u200a Welles was given some degree of creative control,:\u200a19\u200a and he endeavored to personalize the film and develop a nightmarish tone.:\u200a2:30\u200a He worked on the general rewrite of the script and wrote scenes at the beginning of the picture that were shot but subsequently cut by the producers.:\u200a186\u200a He filmed in long takes that largely thwarted the control given to editor Ernest J. Nims under the terms of the contract.:\u200a15:45\u200a\nThe Stranger was the first commercial film to use documentary footage from the Nazi concentration camps.:\u200a189\u200a Welles had seen the footage in early May 1945:\u200a102:03\u200a in San Francisco,:\u200a56\u200a as a correspondent and discussion moderator at the UN Conference on International Organization.:\u200a304\u200a He wrote of the Holocaust footage in his syndicated New York Post column May 7, 1945.:\u200a56\u201357\u200a\nCompleted a day ahead of schedule and under budget,:\u200a379\u2013380\u200a The Stranger was the only film made by Welles to have been a bona fide box office success upon its release. Its cost was $1.034 million; 15 months after its release it had grossed $3.216 million. Within weeks of the completion of the film, International Pictures backed out of its promised four-picture deal with Welles. No reason was given, but the impression was left that The Stranger would not make money.:\u200a381\n\nAround the World\nIn the summer of 1946, Welles moved to New York to direct the Broadway musical Around the World, a stage adaptation of Jules Verne's novel Around the World in Eighty Days with a book by Welles and music by Cole Porter. Producer Mike Todd, who would later produce the successful 1956 film adaptation, pulled out from the lavish and expensive production, leaving Welles to support the finances. When Welles ran out of money he convinced Columbia Pictures president Harry Cohn to send enough money to continue the show, and in exchange Welles promised to write, produce, direct and star in a film for Cohn for no further fee. The stage show soon failed due to poor box-office, with Welles unable to claim the losses on his taxes. Inspired by magician and cinema pioneer Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s, the show required 55 stagehands and used films to bridge scenes. Welles said it was his favorite of his stage productions. Regarding its extravagance, critic Robert Garland said it had \"everything but the kitchen sink.\" The next night, Welles brought out a kitchen sink.\n\nRadio (1946)\nIn 1946, Welles began two new radio series\u2014The Mercury Summer Theatre of the Air for CBS, and Orson Welles Commentaries for ABC. While Mercury Summer Theatre featured half-hour adaptations of some classic Mercury radio shows from the 1930s, the first episode was a condensation of his Around the World stage play, and is the only record of Cole Porter's music for the project. Several original Mercury actors returned for the series, as well as Bernard Herrmann. Welles invested his earnings into his failing stage play. Commentaries was a political vehicle for him, continuing the themes from his New York Post column. Again, Welles lacked a clear focus, until the NAACP brought to his attention the case of Isaac Woodard. Welles brought significant attention to Woodard's cause.\nThe last broadcast of Orson Welles Commentaries on October 6, 1946, marked the end of Welles's own radio shows.:\u200a401\n\nThe Lady from Shanghai\nThe film that Welles was obliged to make in exchange for Harry Cohn's help in financing the stage production Around the World was The Lady from Shanghai, filmed in 1947 for Columbia Pictures. Welles intended it to be a modest thriller, but the budget skyrocketed after Cohn suggested that Welles's then-estranged wife Rita Hayworth star. \nCohn disliked Welles's rough cut, particularly the confusing plot and lack of close-ups, and was not in sympathy with Welles's Brechtian use of irony and black comedy, especially in a farcical courtroom scene. Cohn ordered extensive editing and re-shoots. After heavy editing by the studio, approximately one hour of Welles's first cut was removed, including much of a climactic confrontation scene in an amusement park funhouse. While expressing displeasure at the cuts, Welles was particularly appalled with the musical score. The film was considered a disaster in America at the time of release, though the closing shootout in a hall of mirrors (the use of mirrors being a recurrent motif of Welles's, starting with Kane) has since become a touchstone of film noir. Not long after release, Welles and Hayworth finalized their divorce.\nAlthough The Lady from Shanghai was acclaimed in Europe, it was not embraced until decades later in the U.S., where it is now often regarded as a classic of film noir.\n\nMacbeth\nPrior to 1948, Welles convinced Republic Pictures to let him direct a low-budget version of Macbeth, featuring highly stylized sets and costumes, and a cast of actors lip-syncing to a pre-recorded soundtrack, one of many innovative cost-cutting techniques Welles deployed in an attempt to make an epic film from B-movie resources. The script, adapted by Welles, is a violent reworking of Shakespeare's original, freely cutting and pasting lines into new contexts via a collage technique and recasting Macbeth as a clash of pagan and proto-Christian ideologies. Some voodoo trappings of the famous Welles\/Houseman Negro Theatre stage adaptation are visible, especially in the film's characterization of the Weird Sisters, who create an effigy of Macbeth as a charm to enchant him. Of all Welles's post-Kane Hollywood productions, Macbeth is stylistically closest to Kane in its long takes and deep focus photography.\nRepublic initially trumpeted the film as an important work but decided it did not care for the Scottish accents and held up general release for almost a year after early negative press reaction, including Life's comment that Welles's film \"doth foully slaughter Shakespeare.\" Welles left for Europe, while co-producer and lifelong supporter Richard Wilson reworked the soundtrack. Welles returned and cut 20 minutes from the film at Republic's request and recorded narration to cover some gaps. The film was decried as a disaster. Macbeth had influential fans in Europe, especially the French poet and filmmaker Jean Cocteau, who hailed the film's \"crude, irreverent power\" and careful shot design, and described the characters as haunting \"the corridors of some dreamlike subway, an abandoned coal mine, and ruined cellars oozing with water.\"\n\nEurope (1948\u20131956)\nIn Italy he starred as Cagliostro in the 1949 film Black Magic. His co-star, Akim Tamiroff, impressed Welles so much that Tamiroff would appear in four of Welles's productions during the 1950s and 1960s.\nThe following year, Welles starred as Harry Lime in Carol Reed's The Third Man, alongside Joseph Cotten, his friend and co-star from Citizen Kane, with a script by Graham Greene and a memorable score by Anton Karas. In it, Welles makes what Roger Ebert called \"the most famous entrance in the movies, and one of the most famous speeches.\" Greene credited the speech to Welles.\nA few years later, British radio producer Harry Alan Towers would resurrect Lime in the radio series The Adventures of Harry Lime.\nWelles appeared as Cesare Borgia in the 1949 Italian film Prince of Foxes, with Tyrone Power and Mercury Theatre alumnus Everett Sloane, and as the Mongol warrior Bayan in the 1950 film version of the novel The Black Rose (again with Tyrone Power).\n\nOthello\nDuring this time, Welles was channeling his money from acting jobs into a self-financed film version of Shakespeare's Othello. From 1949 to 1951, Welles worked on Othello, filming on location in Italy and Morocco. The film featured Welles's friends Miche\u00e1l Mac Liamm\u00f3ir as Iago and Hilton Edwards as Desdemona's father Brabantio. Suzanne Cloutier starred as Desdemona and Campbell Playhouse alumnus Robert Coote appeared as Iago's associate Roderigo.\nFilming was suspended several times as Welles ran out of funds and left for acting jobs, accounted in detail in MacLiamm\u00f3ir's memoir Put Money in Thy Purse. The American release prints had a technically flawed soundtrack, suffering from a dropout of sound at every quiet moment. Welles's daughter, Beatrice Welles-Smith, restored Othello in 1992 for a wide re-release. The restoration included reconstructing Angelo Francesco Lavagnino's original musical score, which was originally inaudible, and adding ambient stereo sound effects, which were not in the original film. The restoration went on to a successful theatrical run in America. David Thomson writes of Welles's Othello, \"the poetry hangs in the air, like sea mist or incense.\" Anthony Lane writes that \"Some of the action was shot in Venice, and I occasionally wonder what crept into the camera casing; the movie looks blackened and silvery, like an aged mirror, or as if the emulsion of the print were already poised to decay. You can't tell what is or isn't Shakespeare, where his influence begins and ends.\" The movie premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Grand Prix (precursor of the Palme d'or).\nIn 1952, Welles continued finding work in England after the success of the Harry Lime radio show. Harry Alan Towers offered Welles another series, The Black Museum, which ran for 52 weeks with Welles as host and narrator. Director Herbert Wilcox offered Welles the part of the victim in Trent's Last Case, based on Edmund Clerihew Bentley's novel. In 1953, the BBC hired Welles to read an hour of selections from Walt Whitman's Song of Myself. Towers hired Welles again, to play Professor Moriarty in the radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes starring John Gielgud and Ralph Richardson.\nWelles briefly returned to America to make his first appearance on television, starring in the Omnibus presentation of King Lear, broadcast live on CBS October 18, 1953. Directed by Peter Brook, the production costarred Natasha Parry, Beatrice Straight and Arnold Moss.\nIn 1954, director George More O'Ferrall offered Welles the title role in the 'Lord Mountdrago' segment of Three Cases of Murder, co-starring Alan Badel. Herbert Wilcox cast Welles as the antagonist in Trouble in the Glen opposite Margaret Lockwood, Forrest Tucker and Victor McLaglen. Old friend John Huston cast him as Father Mapple in his 1956 film adaptation of Herman Melville's Moby-Dick, starring Gregory Peck.\n\nMr. Arkadin\nWelles's next turn as director was the film Mr. Arkadin (1955), which was produced by his political mentor from the 1940s, Louis Dolivet. It was filmed in France, Germany, Spain and Italy on a very limited budget. Based loosely on several episodes of the Harry Lime radio show, it stars Welles as a billionaire who hires a man to delve into the secrets of his past. The film stars Robert Arden, who had worked on the Harry Lime series; Welles's third wife, Paola Mori, whose voice was dubbed by actress Billie Whitelaw; and guest stars Akim Tamiroff, Michael Redgrave, Katina Paxinou and Mischa Auer. Frustrated by his slow progress in the editing room, producer Dolivet removed Welles from the project and finished the film without him. Eventually, five different versions of the film would be released, two in Spanish and three in English. The version that Dolivet completed was retitled Confidential Report. In 2005 Stefan Droessler of the Munich Film Museum oversaw a reconstruction of the surviving film elements.\n\nTelevision projects\nIn 1955, Welles also directed two television series for the BBC. The first was Orson Welles' Sketch Book, a series of six 15-minute shows featuring Welles drawing in a sketchbook to illustrate his reminiscences including such topics as the filming of It's All True and the Isaac Woodard case. The second was Around the World with Orson Welles, a series of six travelogues set in different locations around Europe (such as Vienna, the Basque Country between France and Spain, and England). Welles served as host and interviewer, his commentary including documentary facts and his own personal observations (a technique he would continue to explore in later works).\nDuring Episode 3 of Sketchbook, Welles makes a deliberate attack on the abuse of police powers around the world. The episode starts with him telling the story of Isaac Woodard, an African-American veteran of the South Pacific during World War II being falsely accused by a bus driver of being drunk and disorderly, who then has a policeman remove the man from the bus. Woodard is not arrested right away, but rather he is beaten into unconsciousness nearly to the point of death and when he finally regains consciousness he is permanently blinded. By the time doctors from the US Army located him three weeks later, there was nothing that could be done. Welles assures the audience that he personally saw to it that justice was served to this policeman although he doesn't mention what type of justice was delivered. Welles then goes on to give other examples of police being given more power and authority than is necessary. The title of this episode is \"The Police\".\nIn 1956, Welles completed Portrait of Gina. He left the only copy of it in his room at the H\u00f4tel Ritz in Paris. The film cans would remain in a lost-and-found locker at the hotel for several decades, where they were discovered in 1986, after Welles's death.\n\nReturn to Hollywood (1956\u20131959)\nIn 1956, Welles returned to Hollywood. He began filming a projected pilot for Desilu, owned by Lucille Ball and her husband Desi Arnaz, who had recently purchased the former RKO studios. The film was The Fountain of Youth, based on a story by John Collier. Originally deemed not viable as a pilot, the film was not aired until 1958\u2014and won the Peabody Award for excellence.\nWelles guest starred on television shows including I Love Lucy. On radio, he was narrator of Tomorrow (October 17, 1956), a nuclear holocaust drama produced and syndicated by ABC and the Federal Civil Defense Administration. Welles's next feature film role was in Man in the Shadow for Universal Pictures in 1957, starring Jeff Chandler.\n\nTouch of Evil\nWelles stayed on at Universal to co-star with Charlton Heston in Touch of Evil, based on Whit Masterson's novel Badge of Evil. Originally hired as an actor, Welles was promoted to director by Universal Studios at the insistence of Heston.:\u200a154\u200a The film reunited many actors and technicians with whom Welles had worked in Hollywood in the 1940s, including cameraman Russell Metty (The Stranger), makeup artist Maurice Seiderman (Citizen Kane), and actors Joseph Cotten, Marlene Dietrich and Akim Tamiroff. Filming proceeded smoothly, with Welles finishing on schedule and on budget, and the studio bosses praising the daily rushes. Nevertheless, after the end of production, the studio re-edited the film, re-shot scenes, and shot new exposition scenes to clarify the plot.:\u200a175\u2013176\u200a Welles wrote a 58-page memo outlining suggestions and objections, stating that the film was no longer his version\u2014it was the studio's, but as such, he was still prepared to help with it.:\u200a175\u2013176\u200a The movie was shown at the 1958 Brussels World's Fair, where it won the grand prize. Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut saw the film in Brussels, and it influenced his debut The 400 Blows, one of the seminal films of the French New Wave.\nIn 1978, a longer preview version of the film was discovered and released. In 1998, Walter Murch reedited the film according to Welles's specifications in his memo. Murch said \"I'm just flabbergasted when I read his memos, thinking that he was writing these ideas forty years ago, because, if I was working on a film now and a director came up with ideas like these, I'd be amazed\u2014pleased but amazed\u2014to realize that someone was thinking that hard about sound\u2014which is all too rare\". The film was influential in its use of a handheld camera, notably in the scene in the elevator. Murch says that \"I'm sure Godard and Truffaut, who were big fans of Touch of Evil, learned from that scene how they could achieve exactly what they wanted\u2014at once both a fresh sense of reality and ingenuity.\"\nAs Universal reworked Touch of Evil, Welles began filming his  adaptation of Miguel de Cervantes's Don Quixote in Mexico, starring Mischa Auer as Quixote and Akim Tamiroff as Sancho Panza.\n\nReturn to Europe (1959\u20131970)\nHe continued shooting Don Quixote in Spain and Italy, but replaced Mischa Auer with Francisco Reiguera, and resumed acting jobs.\nIn Italy in 1959, Welles directed his own scenes as King Saul in Richard Pottier's film David and Goliath. In Hong Kong, he co-starred with Curt J\u00fcrgens in Lewis Gilbert's film Ferry to Hong Kong. In 1960, in Paris he co-starred in Richard Fleischer's film Crack in the Mirror. In Yugoslavia he starred in Richard Thorpe's film The Tartars and Veljko Bulaji\u0107's Battle of Neretva.\nThroughout the 1960s, filming continued on Quixote on-and-off until the end of the decade, as Welles evolved the concept, tone and ending several times. Although he had a complete version of the film shot and edited at least once, he would continue toying with the editing well into the 1980s; he never completed a version of the film he was fully satisfied with and would junk existing footage and shoot new footage. (In one case, he had a complete cut ready in which Quixote and Sancho Panza end up going to the Moon, but he felt the ending was rendered obsolete by the 1969 Moon landings and burned 10 reels of this version.) As the process went on, Welles gradually voiced all of the characters himself and provided narration. In 1992, the director Jes\u00fas Franco constructed a film out of the portions of Quixote left behind by Welles. Some of the film stock had decayed badly. While the Welles footage was greeted with interest, the post-production by Franco was met with harsh criticism.\nIn 1961, Welles directed In the Land of Don Quixote, a series of eight half-hour episodes for the Italian television network RAI. Similar to the Around the World with Orson Welles series, they presented travelogues of Spain and included Welles's wife, Paola, and their daughter, Beatrice. Though Welles was fluent in Italian, the network was not interested in him providing Italian narration because of his accent, and the series sat unreleased until 1964, by which time the network had added Italian narration of its own. Ultimately, versions of the episodes were released with the original musical score Welles had approved, but without the narration.\n\nThe Trial\nIn 1962, Welles directed his adaptation of The Trial, based on the novel by Franz Kafka and produced by Michael and Alexander Salkind. The cast included Jeanne Moreau, Romy Schneider, Paola Mori, Akim Tamiroff and Anthony Perkins as Josef K. While filming exteriors in Zagreb, Welles was informed that the Salkinds had run out of money, meaning that there could be no set construction. No stranger to shooting on found locations, Welles soon filmed the interiors in the Gare d'Orsay, at that time an abandoned railway station in Paris. Welles thought the location possessed a \"Jules Verne modernism\" and a melancholy sense of \"waiting\", both suitable for Kafka. To remain in the spirit of Kafka, Welles set up the cutting room together with the Film Editor, Frederick Muller (as Fritz Muller), in the old unused, cold, depressing, station master office. The film failed at the box-office. Peter Bogdanovich observed that Welles found the film riotously funny. Welles also told a BBC interviewer that it was his best film. While filming The Trial Welles met Oja Kodar, who later became his partner and collaborator for the last 20 years of his life.:\u200a428\u200a\nWelles played a film director in La Ricotta (1963), Pier Paolo Pasolini's segment of the Ro.Go.Pa.G. movie, although his renowned voice was dubbed by Italian writer Giorgio Bassani.:\u200a516\u200a He continued taking what work he could find acting, narrating or hosting other people's work, and began filming Chimes at Midnight, which was completed in 1965.\n\nChimes at Midnight\nFilmed in Spain, Chimes at Midnight was based on Welles's play, Five Kings, in which he drew material from six Shakespeare plays to tell the story of Sir John Falstaff (Welles) and his relationship with Prince Hal (Keith Baxter). The cast includes John Gielgud, Jeanne Moreau, Fernando Rey and Margaret Rutherford; the film's narration, spoken by Ralph Richardson, is taken from the chronicler Raphael Holinshed.:\u200a249\u200a Welles held the film in high regard: \"It's my favorite picture, yes. If I wanted to get into heaven on the basis of one movie, that's the one I would offer up.\":\u200a203\u200a Anthony Lane writes that \"what Welles means to conjure up is not just historical continuity\u2014the very best of Sir John\u2014but a sense that the Complete Works of Shakespeare constitute, as it were, one vast poem, from which his devoted and audacious interpreters are free to quote... the picture both honors Shakespeare and spurns the industry, academic and theatrical, that has encrusted him over time.\" \nIn 1966, Welles directed a film for French television, an adaptation of The Immortal Story, by Karen Blixen. Released in 1968, it stars Jeanne Moreau, Roger Coggio and Norman Eshley. The film had a successful run in French theaters. At this time Welles met Oja Kodar again, and gave her a letter he had written to her and had been keeping for four years; they would not be parted again. They immediately began a collaboration both personal and professional. The first of these was an adaptation of Blixen's The Heroine, meant to be a companion piece to The Immortal Story and starring Kodar. Unfortunately, funding disappeared after one day's shooting. After completing this film, he appeared in a brief cameo as Cardinal Wolsey in Fred Zinnemann's adaptation of A Man for All Seasons\u2014a role for which he won considerable acclaim.\n\nIn 1967, Welles began directing The Deep, based on the novel Dead Calm by Charles Williams and filmed off the shore of Yugoslavia. The cast included Moreau, Kodar and Laurence Harvey. Personally financed by Welles and Kodar, they could not obtain the funds to complete the project, and it was abandoned a few years later after the death of Harvey. The surviving footage was eventually edited and released by the Filmmuseum M\u00fcnchen. In 1968 Welles began filming a TV special for CBS under the title Orson's Bag, combining travelogue, comedy skits and a condensation of Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice with Welles as Shylock. In 1969 Welles called again the Film Editor Frederick Muller to work with him re-editing the material and they set up cutting rooms at the Safa Palatino Studios in Rome. Funding for the show sent by CBS to Welles in Switzerland was seized by the IRS. Without funding, the show was not completed. The surviving film clips portions were eventually released by the Filmmuseum M\u00fcnchen.\nIn 1969, Welles authorized the use of his name for a cinema in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Orson Welles Cinema remained in operation until 1986, with Welles making a personal appearance there in 1977. Also in 1969, he played a supporting role in John Huston's The Kremlin Letter. Drawn by the numerous offers he received to work in television and films, and upset by a tabloid scandal reporting his affair with Kodar, Welles abandoned the editing of Don Quixote and moved back to America in 1970.\n\nLater career (1970\u20131985)\nWelles returned to Hollywood, where he continued to self-finance his film and television projects. While offers to act, narrate and host continued, Welles also found himself in great demand on television talk shows. He made frequent appearances for Dick Cavett, Johnny Carson, Dean Martin and Merv Griffin. Welles's primary focus during his final years was The Other Side of the Wind, a project that was filmed intermittently between 1970 and 1976. Co-written by Welles and Oja Kodar, it is the story of an aging film director (John Huston) looking for funds to complete his final film. The cast includes Peter Bogdanovich, Susan Strasberg, Norman Foster, Edmond O'Brien, Cameron Mitchell and Dennis Hopper. Financed by Iranian backers, ownership of the film fell into a legal quagmire after the Shah of Iran was deposed. The legal disputes kept the film in its unfinished state until early 2017 and it was finally released in November 2018.\n\n Welles portrayed Louis XVIII of France in the 1970 film Waterloo, and narrated the beginning and ending scenes of the historical comedy Start the Revolution Without Me (1970).\nIn 1971, Welles directed a short adaptation of Moby-Dick, a one-man performance on a bare stage, reminiscent of his 1955 stage production Moby Dick \u2013 Rehearsed. Never completed, it was eventually released by the Filmmuseum M\u00fcnchen. He also appeared in Ten Days' Wonder, co-starring with Anthony Perkins and directed by Claude Chabrol (who reciprocated with a bit part as himself in Other Wind), based on a detective novel by Ellery Queen. That same year, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave him an Academy Honorary Award \"for superlative artistry and versatility in the creation of motion pictures.\" Welles pretended to be out of town and sent John Huston to claim the award, thanking the Academy on film. In his speech, Huston criticized the Academy for presenting the award while refusing to support Welles's projects. In 1972, Welles acted as on-screen narrator for the film documentary version of Alvin Toffler's 1970 book Future Shock. Working again for a British producer, Welles played Long John Silver in director John Hough's Treasure Island (1972), an adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's novel, which had been the second story broadcast by The Mercury Theatre on the Air in 1938. This was the last time he played the lead role in a major film. Welles also contributed to the script, although his writing credit was attributed to the pseudonym 'O. W. Jeeves'. In some versions of the film Welles's original recorded dialog was redubbed by Robert Rietty.\n\nIn 1973, Welles completed F for Fake, a personal essay film about art forger Elmyr de Hory and the biographer Clifford Irving. Based on an existing documentary by Fran\u00e7ois Reichenbach, it included new material with Oja Kodar, Joseph Cotten, Paul Stewart and William Alland. An excerpt of Welles's 1930s War of the Worlds broadcast was recreated for this film; however, none of the dialogue heard in the film actually matches what was originally broadcast. Welles filmed a five-minute trailer, rejected in the U.S., that featured several shots of a topless Kodar. Welles hosted a British syndicated anthology series, Orson Welles's Great Mysteries, during the 1973\u201374 television season. His brief introductions to the 26 half-hour episodes were shot in July 1973 by Gary Graver.:\u200a443\u200a The year 1974 also saw Welles lending his voice to And Then There Were None produced by his former associate, Harry Alan Towers and starring an international cast that included Oliver Reed, Elke Sommer and Herbert Lom. In 1975, Welles narrated the documentary Bugs Bunny: Superstar, focusing on Warner Bros. cartoons from the 1940s. Also in 1975, the American Film Institute presented Welles with its third Lifetime Achievement Award (the first two going to John Ford and James Cagney). At the ceremony, Welles screened two scenes from the nearly finished The Other Side of the Wind.\nIn 1976, Paramount Television purchased the rights for the entire corpus of Nero Wolfe stories for Welles. Welles had once wanted to make a series of Nero Wolfe movies, but author Rex Stout\u2014who was leery of Hollywood adaptations during his lifetime after two disappointing 1930s films\u2014turned him down. Paramount planned to begin with an ABC-TV movie and hoped to persuade Welles to continue the role in a miniseries. Frank D. Gilroy was signed to write the television script and direct the TV movie on the assurance that Welles would star, but by April 1977 Welles had bowed out. In 1980 the Associated Press reported \"the distinct possibility\" that Welles would star in a Nero Wolfe TV series for NBC television. Again, Welles left the project due to creative differences with Paramount. William Conrad was cast in the role.:\u200a87\u201388\u200a\nIn 1979, Welles completed his documentary Filming Othello, featuring Michael MacLiammoir and Hilton Edwards. Made for West German television, it was also released in theaters. That same year, Welles completed his self-produced pilot for The Orson Welles Show, featuring interviews with Burt Reynolds, Jim Henson and Frank Oz and guest-starring the Muppets and Angie Dickinson. Unable to find network interest, the pilot was never broadcast. Also in 1979, Welles appeared in the biopic The Secret of Nikola Tesla, and made a cameo in The Muppet Movie. Beginning in the late 1970s, Welles participated in a series of famous television commercial advertisements. For two years he was on-camera spokesman for the Paul Masson Vineyards, and sales grew by one third during the time Welles intoned what became a popular catchphrase: \"We will sell no wine before its time.\" He was also the voice behind the long-running Carlsberg \"Probably the best lager in the world\" campaign, promoted Domecq sherry on British television and provided narration on adverts for Findus, though the actual adverts have been overshadowed by a famous blooper reel of voice recordings, known as the Frozen Peas reel. He also did commercials for the Preview Subscription Television Service seen on stations around the country including WCLQ\/Cleveland, KNDL\/St. Louis and WSMW\/Boston. As money ran short, he began directing commercials to make ends meet, including the famous British \"Follow the Bear\" commercials for Hofmeister lager.\nIn 1981, Welles hosted the documentary The Man Who Saw Tomorrow, about Nostradamus. In 1982, the BBC broadcast The Orson Welles Story in the Arena series. Interviewed by Leslie Megahey, Welles examined his past in great detail, and several people from his professional past were interviewed as well. It was reissued in 1990 as With Orson Welles: Stories of a Life in Film. Welles provided narration for a 1982 documentary on American public television, the tracks \"Defender\" from Manowar's 1987 album Fighting the World and \"Dark Avenger\" on their 1982 album, Battle Hymns. He also recorded the concert introduction for the live performances of Manowar that says, \"Ladies and gentlemen, from the United States of America, all hail Manowar.\" Manowar have been using this introduction for all of their concerts since then. During the 1980s, Welles worked on such film projects as The Dreamers, based on two stories by Isak Dinesen and starring Oja Kodar, and Orson Welles' Magic Show, which reused material from his failed TV pilot. Another project he worked on was Filming the Trial, the second in a proposed series of documentaries examining his feature films. While much was shot for these projects, none of them was completed. All of them were eventually released by the Filmmuseum M\u00fcnchen.\nIn the mid-1980s, Henry Jaglom taped lunch conversations with Welles at Los Angeles's Ma Maison as well as in New York. Recordings of these sessions were edited by Peter Biskind and published in the 2013 book My Lunches With Orson.\nIn 1984, Welles narrated the short-lived television series Scene of the Crime. During the early years of Magnum, P.I., Welles was the voice of the unseen character Robin Masters, a famous writer and playboy. Welles's death forced this minor character to largely be written out of the series. In an oblique homage to Welles, the Magnum, P.I. producers ambiguously concluded that story arc by having one character accuse another of having hired an actor to portray Robin Masters. He also, in this penultimate year released a music single, titled \"I Know What It Is to Be Young (But You Don't Know What It Is to Be Old)\", which he recorded under Italian label Compagnia Generale del Disco. The song was performed with the Nick Perito Orchestra and the Ray Charles Singers and produced by Jerry Abbott (father of guitarist \"Dimebag Darrell\" Abbott).\nThe last film roles before Welles's death included voice work in the animated films Enchanted Journey (1984) and The Transformers: The Movie (1986), in which he provided the voice for the planet-eating supervillain Unicron. His last film appearance was in Henry Jaglom's 1987 independent film Someone to Love, released two years after his death but produced before his voice-over in Transformers: The Movie. His last television appearance was on Moonlighting. He recorded an introduction to an episode entitled \"The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice\", which was partially filmed in black and white. The episode aired five days after his death and was dedicated to his memory.\n\nPersonal life\nRelationships and family\nOrson Welles and Chicago-born actress and socialite Virginia Nicolson (1916\u20131996) were married on November 14, 1934.:\u200a332\u200a \"Regardless of his later comments, the two were very much in love,\" wrote biographer Patrick McGilligan, \"and she was his salvation.\" The couple separated in December 1939:\u200a226\u200a and were divorced on February 1, 1940. A few months later, on May 18, 1940, she married Marion Davies' nephew Charles Lederer.\n\nAfter bearing with Welles's romances in New York, Virginia had learned that Welles had fallen in love with Mexican actress Dolores del R\u00edo.:\u200a227\u200a  Infatuated with her since adolescence, Welles met del R\u00edo at Darryl Zanuck's ranch:\u200a206\u200a soon after he moved to Hollywood in 1939.:\u200a227\u200a:\u200a168\u200a Their relationship was kept secret until 1941, when del R\u00edo filed for divorce from her second husband. They openly appeared together in New York while Welles was directing the Mercury stage production Native Son.:\u200a212\u200a They acted together in the movie Journey into Fear (1943). Their relationship came to an end due, among other things, to Welles's infidelities. Del R\u00edo returned to Mexico in 1943, shortly before Welles married Rita Hayworth.\n\nWelles married Hayworth on September 7, 1943.:\u200a278\u200a They were divorced on November 10, 1947.:\u200a142\u200a During his last interview, recorded for The Merv Griffin Show on the evening before his death, Welles called Hayworth \"one of the dearest and sweetest women that ever lived ... and we were a long time together\u2014I was lucky enough to have been with her longer than any of the other men in her life.\"\n\nIn 1955, Welles married actress Paola Mori (n\u00e9e Countess Paola di Gerfalco), an Italian aristocrat who starred as Raina Arkadin in his 1955 film Mr. Arkadin. The couple began a passionate affair, and they were married at her parents' insistence.:\u200a168\u200a They were wed in London May 8, 1955,:\u200a417,\u200a419\u200a and never divorced.\nCroatian-born artist and actress Oja Kodar became Welles's longtime companion both personally and professionally from 1966 onward. They lived together for some of the last 20 years of his life.:\u200a255\u2013258\u200a\nWelles had three daughters from his marriages: Christopher Welles Feder (born 1938, with Virginia Nicolson);:\u200a148\u200a Rebecca Welles Manning (1944\u20132004, with Rita Hayworth); and Beatrice Welles (born 1955, with Paola Mori).:\u200a419\u200a\nWelles has been thought to have had a son, British director Michael Lindsay-Hogg (born 1940), with Irish actress Geraldine Fitzgerald, then the wife of Sir Edward Lindsay-Hogg, 4th baronet. When Lindsay-Hogg was 16, his mother reluctantly divulged pervasive rumors that his father was Welles, and she denied them\u2014but in such detail that he doubted her veracity.:\u200a15\u200a Fitzgerald evaded the subject for the rest of her life. Lindsay-Hogg knew Welles, worked with him in the theatre and met him at intervals throughout Welles's life. After learning that Welles's oldest daughter, Chris, his childhood playmate, had long suspected that he was her brother, Lindsay-Hogg initiated a DNA test that proved inconclusive. In his 2011 autobiography, Lindsay-Hogg reported that his questions were resolved by his mother's close friend Gloria Vanderbilt, who wrote that Fitzgerald had told her that Welles was his father.:\u200a265\u2013267\u200a A 2015 Welles biography by Patrick McGilligan, however, reports the impossibility of Welles's paternity: Fitzgerald left the U.S. for Ireland in May 1939, and her son was conceived before her return in late October, whereas Welles did not travel overseas during that period.:\u200a602\u200a\nAfter the death of Rebecca Welles Manning, a man named Marc McKerrow was revealed to be her son\u2014and therefore a direct descendant of Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth\u2014after he requested his adoption records unsealed. While McKerrow and Rebecca were never able to meet due to her cancer, they were in touch before her death, and he attended her funeral. McKerrow's reactions to the revelation and his meeting with Oja Kodar are documented in the 2008 film Prodigal Sons, produced and directed by his sister Kimberly Reed. McKerrow died on June 18, 2010, suddenly in his sleep at the age of 44. His death was attributed to complications from a seizure related to injuries he received in a car accident when he was younger.\nIn the 1940s, Welles had a brief relationship with Maila Nurmi. According to the biography Glamour Ghoul: The Passions and Pain of the Real Vampira, Maila Nurmi, she became pregnant; since Welles was then married to Hayworth, Nurmi gave the child up for adoption. However, the child mentioned in the book was born in 1944. Nurmi revealed in an interview weeks before her death in January 2008 that she met Welles in a New York casting office in the spring of 1946.\nDespite an urban legend promoted by Welles, he is not related to Abraham Lincoln's wartime Secretary of the Navy, Gideon Welles. The myth dates back to the first newspaper feature ever written about Welles\u2014\"Cartoonist, Actor, Poet and only 10\"\u2014in the February 19, 1926, issue of The Capital Times. The article falsely states that he was descended from \"Gideon Welles, who was a member of President Lincoln's cabinet\".:\u200a47\u201348\u200a:\u200a311\u200a As presented by Charles Higham in a genealogical chart that introduces his 1985 biography of Welles, Orson Welles's father was Richard Head Welles (born Wells), son of Richard Jones Wells, son of Henry Hill Wells (who had an uncle named Gideon Wells), son of William Hill Wells, son of Richard Wells (1734\u20131801).\n\nPhysical characteristics\nPeter Noble's 1956 biography describes Welles as \"a magnificent figure of a man, over six feet tall, handsome, with flashing eyes and a gloriously resonant speaking-voice\".:\u200a19\u200a Welles said that a voice specialist once told him he was born to be a heldentenor, a heroic tenor, but that when he was young and working at the Gate Theatre in Dublin, he forced his voice down into a bass-baritone.:\u200a144\u200a\nEven as a baby, Welles was prone to illness, including diphtheria, measles, whooping cough, and malaria. From infancy he suffered from asthma, sinus headaches, and backache:\u200a8\u200a that was later found to be caused by congenital anomalies of the spine. Foot and ankle trouble throughout his life was the result of flat feet.:\u200a560\u200a \"As he grew older\", Brady wrote, \"his ill health was exacerbated by the late hours he was allowed to keep [and] an early penchant for alcohol and tobacco\".:\u200a8\u200a\nIn 1928, at age 13, Welles was already more than six feet tall (1.83 meters) and weighed over 180 pounds (82 kg).:\u200a50\u200a His passport recorded his height as six feet three inches (191 cm), with brown hair and green eyes.:\u200a229\u200a\n\"Crash diets, [pharmaceutical] drugs, and corsets had slimmed him for his early film roles\", wrote biographer Barton Whaley. \"Then always back to gargantuan consumption of high-caloric food and booze. By summer 1949, when he was 34, his weight had crept up to a stout 230 pounds (100 kg). In 1953, he ballooned from 250 to 275 pounds (113 to 125 kilograms). After 1960, he remained permanently obese.\":\u200a329\n\nReligious beliefs\nWhen Peter Bogdanovich once asked him about his religion, Welles gruffly replied that it was none of his business, then misinformed him that he was raised Catholic.:\u200axxx\u200a:\u200a12\u200a Although the Welles family was no longer devout, it was fourth-generation Episcopalian and before that, Quaker and Puritan.:\u200a12\u200a The funeral of Welles's father, Richard H. Welles, was Episcopalian.:\u200a12\u200a\nIn April 1982, when interviewer Merv Griffin asked him about his religious beliefs, Welles replied, \"I try to be a Christian. I don't pray really, because I don't want to bore God.\":\u200a576\u200a \nNear the end of his life, Welles was dining at Ma Maison, his favorite restaurant in Los Angeles, when proprietor Patrick Terrail conveyed an invitation from the head of the Greek Orthodox Church, who asked Welles to be his guest of honor at divine liturgy at Saint Sophia Cathedral. Welles replied, \"Please tell him I really appreciate that offer, but I am an atheist.\":\u200a104\u2013105\u200a\n\"Orson never joked or teased about the religious beliefs of others\", wrote biographer Barton Whaley. \"He accepted it as a cultural artifact, suitable for the births, deaths, and marriages of strangers and even some friends\u2014but without emotional or intellectual meaning for himself.\":\u200a12\n\nPolitics and activism\nWelles was politically active from the beginning of his career. He remained aligned with left-wing politics and the American Left throughout his life, and always defined his political orientation as \"progressive\". A Democrat, he was an outspoken critic of racism in the United States and the practice of segregation.:\u200a46\u200a He was a strong supporter of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal and often spoke out on radio in support of progressive politics. He campaigned heavily for Roosevelt in the 1944 election.\nIn a 1983 conversation with his friend Roger Hill, Welles recalled: \"During a White House dinner, when I was campaigning for Roosevelt, in a toast, with considerable tongue in cheek, he said, 'Orson, you and I are the two greatest actors alive today.' In private that evening, and on several other occasions, he urged me to run for a Senate seat in either California or Wisconsin. He wasn't alone.\":\u200a115\u200a In the 1980s, Welles still expressed admiration for Roosevelt but also described his presidency as \"a semidictatorship\".\nDuring a 1970 appearance on The Dick Cavett Show, Welles claimed to have met Hitler while hiking in Austria with a teacher who was a \"budding Nazi\". He said that Hitler made no impression on him and that he could not remember anything of him from the encounter. He said that he had no personality at all: \"He was invisible. There was nothing there until there were 5,000 people yelling sieg heil.\"\nIn 1946, Welles took to the airwaves in a series of radio broadcasts demanding justice for a decorated black veteran, Isaac Woodard, who had been beaten and blinded by white police officers. Welles devoted his July 28, 1946 program to reading Woodard's affidavit and vowing to bring the officer responsible to justice. He continued his crusade over four subsequent Sunday afternoon broadcasts on ABC Radio. \"The NAACP felt that these broadcasts did more than anything else to prompt the Justice Department to act on the case,\" the Museum of Broadcasting stated in its 1988 retrospect Orson Welles on the Air: The Radio Years.\nFor several years, he wrote a newspaper column on political issues and considered running for the U.S. Senate in 1946, representing his home state of Wisconsin\u2014a seat that was ultimately won by Joseph McCarthy.\nWelles's political activities were reported on pages 155\u2013157 of Red Channels, the anti-Communist publication that, in part, fueled the already flourishing Hollywood Blacklist. He was in Europe during the height of the Red Scare, thereby adding one more reason for the Hollywood establishment to ostracize him.\nIn 1970, Welles narrated (but did not write) a satirical political record on the rise of President Richard Nixon titled The Begatting of the President.\nIn the late 1970s, Welles referred to Josip Tito as \"the greatest man in the world today\" on Yugoslav television.\nWelles spoke before a crowd of 700,000 at a nuclear disarmament rally in Central Park on June 12, 1982, and attacked the policies of President Ronald Reagan and the Republican party.\nAmerican: An Odyssey to 1947, a documentary by Danny Wu that looks at Welles's life against the political landscape of the 1930s and 1940s, had its premiere at the Newport Beach Film Festival in October 2022.\n\nDeath and tributes\nOn the evening of October 9, 1985, Welles recorded his final interview on the syndicated TV program The Merv Griffin Show, appearing with biographer Barbara Leaming. \"Both Welles and Leaming talked of Welles's life, and the segment was a nostalgic interlude,\" wrote biographer Frank Brady.:\u200a590\u2013591\u200a Welles returned to his house in Hollywood and worked into the early hours typing stage directions for the project he and Gary Graver were planning to shoot at UCLA the following day. Welles died sometime on the morning of October 10, following a heart attack.:\u200a453\u200a He was found by his chauffeur at around 10 a.m.; the first of Welles's friends to arrive was Paul Stewart.:\u200a295\u2013297\u200a Welles was 70 years old when he died.\nWelles was cremated by prior agreement with the executor of his estate, Greg Garrison,:\u200a592\u200a whose advice about making lucrative TV appearances in the 1970s made it possible for Welles to pay off a portion of the taxes he owed the IRS.:\u200a549\u2013550\u200a A brief private funeral was attended by Paola Mori and Welles's three daughters\u2014the first time they had ever been together. Only a few close friends were invited: Garrison, Graver, Roger Hill:\u200a298\u200a and Prince Alessandro Tasca di Cuto. Chris Welles Feder later described the funeral as an awful experience.:\u200a1\u20139\u200a\nA public memorial tribute:\u200a593\u200a took place November 2, 1985, at the Directors Guild of America Theater in Los Angeles. Host Peter Bogdanovich introduced speakers including Charles Champlin, Geraldine Fitzgerald, Greg Garrison, Charlton Heston, Roger Hill, Henry Jaglom, Arthur Knight, Oja Kodar, Barbara Leaming, Janet Leigh, Norman Lloyd, Dan O'Herlihy, Patrick Terrail and Robert Wise.:\u200a594\u200a:\u200a299\u2013300\u200a\n\"I know what his feelings were regarding his death\", Joseph Cotten later wrote. \"He did not want a funeral; he wanted to be buried quietly in a little place in Spain. He wanted no memorial services ...\" Cotten declined to attend the memorial program; instead, he sent a short message, ending with the last two lines of a Shakespeare sonnet that Welles had sent him on his most recent birthday::\u200a216\u200a\n\nBut if the while I think on thee, dear friend,All losses are restored and sorrows end.:\u200a217\u200a\nIn 1987 the ashes of Welles were taken to Ronda, Spain, and buried in an old well covered by flowers on the rural estate of a longtime friend, bullfighter Antonio Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez.:\u200a298\u2013299\n\nLegacy and reception\nDavid Thomson credits Welles with \"the creation of a visual style that is simultaneously baroque and precise, overwhelmingly emotional, and unerringly founded in reality.\" Peter Bogdanovich, who was directed by Welles in The Other Side of the Wind, wrote that \"being directed by Welles was like breathing pure oxygen all day long. He was so totally in control that he never had to prove a point out of any kind. I never saw him get angry or impatient, or raise his voice in any way but hilarity... Sometimes Orson was holding the camera himself, but wherever the camera was, he had put it there, and all the lights were placed exactly where he said they were to be put. There wasn't anything seen or heard in any scene that wasn't there because Orson wanted it that way, but he was never dictatorial.\" Welles was a lifelong lover of Shakespeare, and Bogdanovich writes that Chimes at Midnight, in which Welles plays John Falstaff, is \"arguably his best film, and his own personal favorite\"; Joseph McBride and Jonathan Rosenbaum have called it Welles's masterpiece, and Vincent Canby wrote \"it may be the greatest Shakespearean film ever made.\"\nAfter Welles went to South America to film the documentary It's All True, RKO cut more than forty minutes from Ambersons and added a happier ending, against his wishes. The missing footage from Ambersons has been called a \"holy grail\" of cinema. Welles wrote a 58-page memo to Universal about the editing of Touch of Evil, which they disregarded. In 1998, Walter Murch reedited the film according to Welles's specifications. With a development spanning almost 50 years, Welles's final film, The Other Side of the Wind, was posthumously released in 2018.\nKnown for his baritone voice, Welles performed extensively across theatre, radio, and film. He was a lifelong magician, noted for presenting troop variety shows in the war years. He was a lifelong member of the International Brotherhood of Magicians and the Society of American Magicians.\n\nAccolades\nWelles received numerous accolades including an Academy Award, Peabody Award and Grammy Award as well as nominations for a BAFTA Award and Golden Globe Award. His honors include the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1975, the British Film Institute Fellowship in 1983, and the Directors Guild of America Lifetime Achievement Award in 1984. He was inducted into both the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame in 1979, and the National Radio Hall of Fame in 1988. Welles was presented with France's Legion of Honour in 1982.\n\nFilmography\nWelles is known for his work in film as a director, actor and screenwriter. \nWelles's reliance on self-production meant that many of his later projects were filmed piecemeal or remained incomplete. He financed these endeavors through his own fundraising activities, often supplementing his income with additional work to fund his films.\n\nDiscography\nCultural references\nDirector Peter Jackson cast Montreal actor Jean Gu\u00e9rin as Welles in his 1994 film, Heavenly Creatures.\nVincent D'Onofrio portrayed Welles in a cameo appearance in Tim Burton's 1994 film, Ed Wood, where he briefly appears and encourages the eponymous filmmaker to fight for making his movies his own way in spite of his producers.\nVoice actor Maurice LaMarche is known for his Welles impression, heard in Ed Wood (in which he dubbed the dialog of Vincent D'Onofrio); the 1994\u201395 primetime animated series, The Critic; a 2006 episode of The Simpsons; and a 2011 episode of Futurama for which LaMarche won an Emmy Award.

The United States Postal Service was petitioned to honor Welles with a stamp in 2015, the 100th anniversary of his birth, but the effort did not succeed.\nThe 1999 HBO docudrama, RKO 281, tells the story of the making of Citizen Kane, starring Liev Schreiber as Orson Welles.\nTim Robbins's 1999 film Cradle Will Rock chronicles the process and events surrounding Welles and John Houseman's production of the 1937 musical by Marc Blitzstein. Welles is played by actor Angus MacFadyen.\nAustin Pendleton's 2000 play, Orson's Shadow, concerns the 1960 London production of Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco's play Rhinoceros directed by Welles and starring Laurence Olivier. First presented by the Steppenwolf Theatre Company in 2000, the play opened off-Broadway in 2005 and had its European premiere in London in 2015.\nIn Michael Chabon's 2000 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay, the protagonists meet Orson Welles and attend the premiere of Citizen Kane.\nIn the film Fade to Black (2006), a fictional thriller set during Welles's 1948 journey to Rome to star in the movie Black Magic, Danny Huston stars as Welles.\nMe and Orson Welles (2009), based on Robert Kaplow's 2003 novel, stars Zac Efron as a teenager who convinces Welles (Christian McKay) to cast him in his 1937 production of Julius Caesar.

His brother, Steve Cohen, a former aide to New York governor Andrew Cuomo, is a partner at the law firm Zuckerman Spaeder in New York City.\n\nCareer\nJournalism\nAn admirer of the works of journalists A. J. Liebling, Ian Frazier, and Joseph Mitchell, Cohen took a job as a messenger at the offices of The New Yorker magazine, where he published twelve stories in the \"Talk of the Town\" section in eighteen months. After working as a reporter for the New York Observer, in 1994 Cohen joined the staff of Rolling Stone. Since 2007, he has been a contributing editor at Vanity Fair. In  2022, Cohen became a columnist for the Wall Street Journal.\n\nAuthor\nCohen published his first book Tough Jews: Fathers, Sons, and Gangster Dreams\u2014a non-fiction account of the Jewish gangsters of 1930s Brooklyn, notably those involved with Murder, Inc.\u2014in 1998.

Another New York Times critic Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, called it \"exuberant\" and \"a vivid narrative\"; Cohen's book had \"taken the noise of these facts and turned it from gunfire into a kind of music\".\nCritic Michiko Kakutani called Cohen's Sweet and Low \"a classic\" ... \"A telling\u2014and often hilarious\u2014parable about the pursuit and costs of the American Dream\". In 2006, the book made the New York Times list of 100 notable books.\nIn The New York Times Book Review, writer Tony Horwitz said Israel is Real \"accomplished the miraculous. It made a subject that has vexed me since childhood into a riveting story.\" \nCritic and historian Mark Lewis called The Fish That Ate the Whale \"Kiplingesque\" and \"fascinating.\" In The Christian Science Monitor, critic Chris Hartman called the book \"masterful and elegantly written ... a cautionary tale for the ages\". \nReviewing The Last Pirate of New York in the Wall Street Journal, Rinker Buck wrote, \"'The Last Pirate of New York' is history-lite at its best, and readers will finish it with a satisfaction deeply relevant today.\" \nReviewing The Adventures of Herbie Cohen, World's Greatest Negotiator in the Wall Street Journal, Ed Kosner called the work, \"[A] treat of a new book.\" Kosner continues, \"Rich Cohen writes lovingly of his father\u2019s 'love of bull\u2015.' But the accumulated wit and wisdom of Herb Cohen scattered through the book reveals instead a keen grasp of human frailty and a gift for aphorism no less valid for its glibness,\" explaining, \"it\u2019s essentially the saga of a remarkable man who\u2019s fond of saying 'The meaning of life . . . is more life' and knows what he\u2019s talking about.\"\n\nAwards\n2009 The Best American Essays of 2008\n2002  Great Lakes Book Award from the American Booksellers Association for Lake Effect.\n\nSelect bibliography\n\u2014 (1999).

The comic was published by Americomics (a.k.a. AC Comics) in 1983 during a very brief time that AC was able to license the Charlton Comics superheroes before the rights were purchased outright by DC Comics. The team consisted of Captain Atom, Blue Beetle, the Question and Nightshade. This line-up's first appearance was in Americomics Special #1 (August 1983). A revised team made up of existing Americomics characters Captain Paragon, Nightveil, Stardust, Commando D, and Scarlet Scorpion would appear in Captain Paragon and the Sentinels of Justice #1\u20133 (1985\u201386), the title would change to Sentinels of Justice with #4 (the indicia would still state Captain Paragon and the Sentinels of Justice), it would last until issue #6 (1986).\n\nFictional team history\nAC Comics editor and head writer Bill Black had been making plans for a superhero team to be named the Sentinels of Justice when he was contacted by Charlton Comics with a request that AC provide material for the Charlton Bullseye comic book. The team concept was quickly revised, with a roster of Charlton characters. Bullseye was cancelled before the story could be published, but AC was granted a limited license to publish the material already prepared for Charlton.\nAfter AC received news that the series was cancelled, Bill Black returned to his original plan for a team made up of existing Americomics characters.

The Warner Bros. production stars Will Hutchins as Tom Brewster, an Easterner who comes to the Oklahoma Territory to become a lawyer. Brewster was a correspondence-school student whose apparent lack of cowboy skills earned him the nickname \"Sugarfoot\", a designation even below that of a tenderfoot.\nHutchins was the only regular on the show.  In four episodes, Hutchins also plays the dual role of Abram Thomas, a.k.a. \"The Canary Kid\", leader of an outlaw gang who is a dead ringer for Brewster.  In each of these episodes, Brewster is joined in the fight against The Canary Kid's plans by Christopher Colt\u2014i.e., Wayde Preston crossing over from his role in the simultaneously-produced WB series Colt .45.  Towards the very end of the run, Jack Elam was cast in two of the final five episodes as Brewster's occasional sidekick Toothy Thompson, but the series was cancelled shortly thereafter.\n\nBackground\nSugarfoot had no relation to the 1951 Randolph Scott Western film Sugarfoot aside from the studio owning the title (and the theme music), but its pilot episode was a remake of a 1954 Western film called The Boy from Oklahoma starring Will Rogers Jr. as Tom Brewster. The pilot and premiere episode, \"Brannigan's Boots\", was so similar to The Boy from Oklahoma that Sheb Wooley and Slim Pickens reprised their roles from the film.\nAs played by Rogers in the film, Brewster carried no gun, disliked firearms in general, and vanquished villains with his roping skills (\u00e0 la Will Rogers) if friendly persuasion failed. Perhaps for practical reasons, the pilot altered the character slightly and made Brewster more like the typical Western hero\u2014reluctant to use guns (or any other kind of violence), but able and willing to do so if necessary. That remained his stance throughout the series, and the title song mentions that Sugarfoot carries a rifle and a law book.\nWhenever he enters a saloon, Sugarfoot refuses liquor and orders sarsaparilla \"with a dash of cherry\". (Sarsaparilla is a drink similar to root beer, both of which are non-alcohol-based.)\nSugarfoot was one of the earliest products of the alliance between ABC and the fledgling Warner Bros. Television Department, chaired by William T. Orr. During the same period, other similar programs  appeared, including Maverick, Cheyenne, Bronco, Lawman, and Colt .45.  Hutchins appeared as Sugarfoot in crossover episodes of Cheyenne and Maverick, and in an installment of Bronco called \"The Yankee Tornado\" with Peter Breck as a young Theodore Roosevelt. Jack Kelly appeared as Bart Maverick in the Sugarfoot episode \"A Price on His Head\".  James Garner made an appearance as Bret Maverick at the end of the episode \"Misfire.\"\n\nCast\nCast of \"Brannigan's Boots\"\nWill Hutchins as Tom 'Sugarfoot' Brewster\nMerry Anders as Katie Brannigan\nLouis Jean Heydt as Paul Evans\nDennis Hopper as Billy the Kid\nArthur Hunnicutt as Pop Purty\nChubby Johnson as Postmaster Wally Higgins\nSlim Pickens as Shorty\nAinslie Pryor as Mayor Barney Turlock\nSheb Wooley as Pete\n\nCast of The Boy from Oklahoma film (1954)\nWill Rogers Jr. as Sheriff Tom Brewster\nNancy Olson as Katie Brannigan\nLon Chaney Jr. as Crazy Charlie\nAnthony Caruso as Mayor Barney Turlock\nWallace Ford as Postmaster Wally Higgins\nClem Bevans as Pop Pruty, Justice of the Peace\nMerv Griffin as Steve\nLouis Jean Heydt as Paul Evans\nSheb Wooley as Pete Martin\nSlim Pickens as Shorty\nTyler MacDuff as Billy the Kid\nJames Griffith as Joe Downey\n\nGuest stars\nEpisodes\nSeason 1: 1957\u20131958\nSeason 2: 1958\u20131959\nSeason 3: 1959\u20131960\nSeason 4: 1960\u20131961\nBackground and production\nAfter several episodes aired in the second season, a disappointed Hutchins complained in a letter to executive director William T. Orr that the scripts were written so that the lead character Sugarfoot was not particularly needed in many of the episodes.\n\nWayde Preston, who played Christopher Colt on the ABC Western Colt .45, appeared four times in that same role on Sugarfoot in the episodes dealing with \"The Canary Kid,\" a role also played by Will Hutchins.\n\nReception\nSugarfoot finished at #24 in the Nielsen ratings for the 1957-1958 season and #21 for 1958-1959.\n\nRelease\nHome media\nWarner Bros. has released all four seasons on MOD (manufacture on demand) DVD-R's in Region 1 via their Warner Archive Collection.\n\nIn popular culture\nIn an episode of Arrested Development titled \"Spring Breakout\", Sugarfoot is mentioned and the theme song is presented.\nThe series debuted in 1958 in the United Kingdom but only in the Midlands area. In 1960, it was aired nationally in the UK by the BBC, at which point it was renamed Tenderfoot despite the fact that it kept the theme song which refers to the character as \"Sugarfoot\". After 1964, the series returned to ITV, this time not just restricted to the Midlands, where it was once again billed under its original name.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nSugarfoot at IMDb\nRoy Huggins' Archive of American Television Interview Archived 2008-02-26 at the Wayback Machine","82":"The Adventures of William Tell is a British swashbuckler adventure series, first broadcast on the ITV network in 1958, and produced by ITC Entertainment.  In the United States, the episodes aired on the syndicated NTA Film Network in 1958\u20131959.\nWilliam Tell is a folk hero of Switzerland, supposedly active in the early 14th century. He supposedly encouraged the population of the Old Swiss Confederacy to revolt against the regime of Albert I of Germany (reigned 1298\u20131308). Tell's legend is recorded in the White Book of Sarnen (1474).\n\nCast\nMain\nConrad Phillips as William Tell\nJennifer Jayne as Hedda Tell (wife)\nRichard Rogers as Walter Tell (son)\nWilloughby Goddard as Landburgher Gessler\nNigel Green as The Bear\nJack Lambert as Judge Furst (Hedda's father)\nPeter Hammond as Hofmanstahl\n\nNotable actors appearing\nProduction\nThe series was produced by Ralph Smart, who wrote a number of stories for the series and also created and produced Danger Man. The show was made at the National Studios in Elstree.\nThe outdoor scenes were filmed around the mountains and lakes of Snowdonia in Wales. The film base and make-up were at a small farm in Cwm-y-glo in Snowdonia. This is beside Llyn Padarn, a lake which can be seen in many shots (as can cars on the A4086 road on the opposite side of the lake!). The crew used to walk up the mountain from their base, as there was no vehicle access, and brought work for at least three yearly shoots to a tiny corner of North Wales before tourism took off.\nAn accident early occurred to the star, Conrad Phillips, during filming in Snowdonia. He was asked to keep stepping back until he stepped off a 12-foot drop, injuring his knee \u2013 which eventually led to his retirement from acting. Phillips had to wear support bandages during filming but sometimes forgot, causing him to struggle with some action scenes.\nDaily rushes were viewed at the only cinema in the area, at Llanberis, which was taken over from 8.00 until noon every morning. The film was taken to Soho in London for developing and the rushes returned to Llanberis by 8.30 next morning.\nAlthough all three series had location scenes, the third was more studio based and location scenes were mostly taken from unused and reused stock shots from the first and second series. A smaller crew went to Wales for this series and more money was saved by shooting without synchronised sound. In the days of enforced demarcation, this saved several technicians' wages.\nThough in some ways the same as The Adventures of Robin Hood, a brave bowman fighting against a tyrant, William Tell was an even harder show with crossbow bolts killing people and Tell fighting hand-to-hand, which often resulted in the death of the bad guy. Unlike the courtly Sheriff of Nottingham, Gessler was a pig of a man, unshaven, often eating or drinking without manners and throwing his metaphorical as well as literal weight around. Nevertheless, the interaction between the hero and the Sheriff and Land burger respectively, was a strong point in both series, bringing out the quality diction and crispness of both Alan Wheatley's and Willoughby Goddard's acting. In contrast, the absence of a regular enemy in the TV series Sir Francis Drake weakened that series.\nThe Adventures of William Tell series was repeated well into the 1960s. In June 2020 the series began a rerun on the British Talking Pictures TV channel.\n\nMusic\nThe series featured a long-remembered theme song, with music based on the William Tell Overture by Gioachino Rossini. For the show, the song lyrics were by Harold Purcell and were sung by David Whitfield.\nBecause this portion of Rossini's overture was the theme of The Lone Ranger in the United States, a different portion of the overture, with lyrics added, became the theme song there, titled: The Freedom Song \u2013 \"Marching Behind William Tell\" by Geoffrey Parsons. This is on The Network DVD episode Castle of Fear.\nIncidental music was by Albert Elms and Sydney John Kay.\n\nLyrics\nVerses 1, 2, 4 with the opening titles, 6, 7, 8, 9 with the closing credits.\n\nEpisodes\nAirdate is for ATV Midlands. ITV regions varied date and order.\n\nHome media\nThe entire series is available on a 5-disc region 2 DVD set from Network Distributing Ltd Home Entertainment\/Granada Ventures in 2007. The complete series is also available on a 3-disc region 1 DVD set.\n\nRelated series\nConrad Phillips later played William Tell's sidekick, Stefan, in the series Crossbow which ran from August 1987 till February 1989. William Tell was played by Will Lyman. The series ran for 72 thirty-minute colour episodes over three seasons, 24 each, with the third season unaired in America. Other members of the cast were Jeremy Clyde as Hermann Gessler, Valentine Pelka as Roland, Melinda Mullins as Blade and David Barry Gray as\nTell's son Matthew.\nThere was a series derived from William Tell in New Zealand entitled The Legend of William Tell, which lasted one season of 16 episodes of sixty minutes from August till December 1998. In the cast were Kieren Hutchison as William Tell, Andrew Binns as Xax, Nathaniel Lees as Leon, Katrina Browne as Aruna, Ray Henwood as Kreel, Sharon Tyrell as Kalem, Beth Allen as Princess Varga and Drew Neemia as Drogo.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nThe Adventures of William Tell at IMDb\n\"William Tell\" (1958\u201359) \u2013 episode guide at The Classic TV Archive\nModern review of the series\nTelevisionHeaven.com","83":"The Assets is an eight-part American drama television miniseries that aired on ABC in 2014.

It is based on the 1926 novel The Avenger by Edgar Wallace. It was shot at the Bavaria Studios in Munich. The film's sets were designed by the art director Willi Herrmann.\n\nPlot\nA number of packaged disembodied heads have been found in random areas of the English countryside. In each package is a letter to the police from the killer, who dubs himself \"The Executioner.\" The victims are seemingly unrelated to one another. When a Scotland Yard employee is killed, Detective Mike Brixan (Heinz Drache) of Special Branch is called in to investigate. The only clue is that a black, four-door sedan was seen at the scene of the crime and that the typewriter used by the killer has two offset characters.\nWhile interviewing Ruth Sanders (Ina Duscha), the niece of the man killed and the last person to see him alive, while working as an extra on a film set, Brixan discovers a page of a script written on the same typewriter as the Executioner's letters.

The Avengers battle the world's most dangerous supervillains, including Baron Zemo, the Leader, Kang the Conqueror, and Ultron, as well as the criminal organizations Hydra and A.I.M. It is ultimately revealed that Thor's adopted brother Loki orchestrated the breakout and had the Enchantress form the Masters of Evil to distract the Avengers so that he can conquer Earth.\n\nSeason two\nFollowing Loki's defeat, the Avengers track down the remnants of the Masters of Evil. The team is joined by Ms. Marvel and the Vision as they face new enemies including Doctor Doom, Thunderbolt Ross, and the Red Skull, as well as alien threats such as the Skrulls, the Kree, and Galactus. The season alludes to a developing storyline in which Surtur, now free of his imprisonment in Muspelheim, slowly gathers his strength to oppose the Avengers as a prelude to Ragnar\u00f6k.\nNumerous other Marvel Comics characters make guest appearances, such as Spider-Man, Wolverine, Scott Lang (the second Ant-Man) and his daughter Cassandra, the Heroes for Hire, Crossfire, the Guardians of the Galaxy, Quake, Beta Ray Bill, the Falcon, and lastly the Winter Soldier.\n\nEpisode list\nCast\nPrincipal cast\nBrian Bloom \u2013 Steve Rogers \/ Captain America\nChris Cox \u2013 Clint Barton \/ Hawkeye, Crimson Dynamo, Fandral, Rattler\nJennifer Hale \u2013 Carol Danvers \/ Ms. Marvel, Corina Korvac\nPeter Jessop \u2013 Vision\nPhil LaMarr \u2013 J.A.R.V.I.S., Wonder Man\nEric Loomis \u2013 Tony Stark \/ Iron Man\nJames C.

However, it never made it past the scripting stages before the team was brought on to create a new series based on the Avengers.\n\nProduction\nMarvel announced in October 2008 that its Marvel Animation division and the outside studio Film Roman would produce an Avengers animated TV series, The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes, for planned broadcast in 2010. Fifty-two episodes have been confirmed as being in production. The show's executive producers include Simon Philips and Eric S. Rollman. Joshua Fine serves as supervising producer and Christopher Yost serves as story editor on the show. A 20-part micro-series debuted on September 22, 2010, on Disney XD, focusing on each hero's backstory and the events that lead to the main series. The idea behind the micro-episodes came after the success of Star Wars: The Clone Wars. The series started airing on Marvel's sister network, Disney XD in the United States on October 20, 2010, and on Teletoon in Canada on October 22, 2010, in English and March 2011 in French. According to Jeph Loeb, season 2 would presumably begin around October 2011, same as season 1 and producer Josh Fine tweeted in April 2011 that 13 episodes have been completed. Ciro Nieli, one of the show's developers, also had a hand in creating Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!.\nAt the 2011 New York Comic-Con, Marvel TV director, Jeph Loeb contradicted his earlier statement of season 2 launch in late 2011. Loeb announced at the panel at New York Comic-con that \"Avengers Season 2 will be coming in early 2012 (to coincide with Ultimate Spider-Man).\" This date would later get clarified to April 1, 2012. Dong Woo Animation, Lotto Animation and Noxxon Enterprise has contributed some of the animation for this series.\n\nCancellation\nThe Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes was not renewed for a third season and was succeeded by a new Avengers show called Avengers Assemble in 2013. On Saturday, July 14, 2012, at the 2012 Marvel Television Presents panel at San Diego Comic-Con, Jeph Loeb, Head of Marvel Television, said of the relationship between the two shows:\n\nWe're not in any way saying Earth's Mightiest Heroes never happened. You will see an epic conclusion. And then you'll say, 'Oh, what's next?'\nThe only voice actors to reprise their roles for Avengers Assemble are Fred Tatasciore and James Matthis III as the Hulk and Black Panther, respectively. Additionally, Drake Bell returned to voice Spider-Man for guest appearances, while the other members of the team share their voices with their counterparts in the separate Ultimate Spider-Man series.\n\nPlans for Season 3 & Beyond\nAccording to Christopher Yost, if the 3rd season had occurred, the first half of the season would have had Surtur as the main antagonist in an adaptation of Ragnar\u00f6k, and the second half would have focused on introducing the X-Men, where he would have focused on Avengers vs. X-Men, in which the Phoenix Force would have played an important role. Being a season focused on \"magic and mutants\". It was also mentioned that his line-up for the X-Men would have been Professor X, Cyclops, Marvel Girl, Wolverine, Nightcrawler, Storm, Shadowcat, Colossus, Rogue, among others that were necessary. An episode was planned in which the X-Men would join the Avengers to also defeat common villains, such as Magneto, his brotherhood, Marauders, Silver Samurai, Omega Red and more.\nDue to changes among executives in the direction of the second half of the 2nd season (specifically the episodes after the Secret Invasion adaptation), the series producers received new orders that altered the development of the show and some ideas were moved to the cancelled 3rd season. The Red Skull story had originally been conceived to be part of a third season saga and extended into a hypothetical fourth season, before being compressed into a secondary arc in the latter half of season 2. Thus as it was considered that the story of Unlimited Ultron and his robotic replacement plan was introduced very soon after the Skrull invasion with a similar story, wishing that this arc had been carried over to later seasons. Furthermore, among discarded ideas or modified that could have been rescued in the continuation of the series, Cristopher Yost mentions that they wanted to introduce Nova, in an episode focused on him, since the 2nd season and that the Silver Surfer could not be used in the series due to a ban from executives. On the other hand, he mentioned that Spider-Man was originally supposed to be the same version of The Spectacular Spider-Man, and that the \"Along Came a Spider\" episode was written as if it were a continuation of the canceled series (however, the claims that they take place in the same universe were avoided due to copyright problems with Sony and the replacement of Josh Keaton's voice by Drake Bell,12 in addition to the fact that Spectacular's Peter Parker was assigned his own Earth-26496 by Marvel Comics, and its creator, Greg Weisman, denies the connection with his project), however, it allows us to speculate that the Peter Parker of Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes (Earth-8096) would have revealed in the following seasons that he have a very similar past like the story of the Spectacular version. It was also originally planned to adapt the \"Emperor Doom\" comic arc (with the appearance of Wonder Man and the Scarlet Witch), before it was altered into the episode \"Emperor Stark\". Other ideas were to present the Winter Soldier in a more lethal, although less powerful way. As well as that Falcon and Mockingbird join the Avengers.  Finally, it was originally intended to make the season 2 finale a 3-part one where the Avengers would further explore Planet Hala (capital of the Kree Empire) after defeating the Supreme Intelligence, and learn more about its culture and its implications in Marvel's cosmic history; ending everything in a confrontation against Galactus there instead of on Earth. At the same time, that season finale would have originally made the New Avengers episode happen after Operation Galactic Storm (as was supposed), replacing the causes that the Avengers were on the other side of the universe and not because Kang took them out of time, where Yellowjacket and Spider-Man would have been searching for Sentry (who was originally supposed to have been introduced in \"Assault on 42\" and have an episode focused on in it). It is also mentioned, by Josh Fine, that Princess Ravonna would have awakened from her stasis in Reed Richards' laboratory and would be seeking to free Kang with Solomon's Frogs, caused because The Avengers collapsed the Kree wormhole and prevented the destruction of Earth's sun, which prevented the event that destroyed the future Earth of Kang's timeline. Due to script changes by orders from above (Man of Action Studios and Jeph Loeb), the Ravonna thread was left pending, so later, when Christopher Yost was working on the comics for the series, he decided to address it as a seed for a possible 3rd season. It is also mentioned, in an original script of \"Powerless\", that Loki was imprisoned in a corner of Yggdrasil and that Amora the Enchantress had freed herself from Surtur's possession and was serving her with free will (due to Thor's constant rejection and not having saved him in the Ballad of Beta Ray Bill episode, making her more Nihilist and losing faith in the value of life), as well as Ms Marvel and not Iron Man being one of the villains' targets to lose their powers (along with an emphasis on Hawkeye)  In addition to Odin having a scene where he lost his eye and would be replaced by Kurse, while Amora would accuse Loki (revealing to have severe facial injuries from the Midgard Serpent's acid) of trying to betray him for wanting to use his powers for his own plans to conquer Asgard instead of contributing to Ragnarok.  Other plans for the third season mentioned by Josh Fine included continuing the Ragnarok storyline, with Thor as the focus of the plot, and a story inspired by Avengers vs. X-Men, as well as giving Carol Danvers the rank of \"Captain Marvel.\" As well as introducing characters like Hercules, Morgan le Fay, Taskmaster, Wanda Maximoff, Pietro Maximoff, Black Knight, Stephen Strange, etc.\nCharacter designer Thomas Perkins did a series of concept art illustrations in 2012 of what a third season could have looked like. Characters appearing in the art included the New Avengers, Impossible Man, Mockingbird, Human Fly, Rom the Spaceknight, Crystar, Deathlok, Black Knight, U-Foes, Adam Warlock, Morbius, Baron Blood, Daimon Hellstrom, 3-D Man, Omega the Unknown, Captain Universe (with Janet Van Dyne with the Enigma Force), Bill Foster (future Goliath, although still the new Giant-Man), Monica Rambeau, Machine Man, Shuma-Gorath, Uatu the Watcher and members of the X-Men like Cyclops, Jean Grey, Rogue (with the body of Ms Marvel), Nightcrawler, Storm and others. He also did illustrations for Black Bolt of the Inhumans and the Super-Adaptoid.\nIn September 2020, for the 10-year anniversary of the series' premiere, Christopher Yost revealed his plans for each episode for the cancelled Season Three (as well as revealing the first pages of the script for the 1st episode of season 3), that included characters that never made it into the show. Those including heroes like Doctor Strange, Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver (these two would have joined the Avengers), Tigra (who would be a founding member of the West Coast Avengers), Nova (Richard Rider), Namor, The Defenders, etc. Also including villains like Nightmare, Magneto, the Brotherhood of Mutants, Modred the Mystic, Kulan Gath, the High Evolutionary, Chthon, the Midgard Serpent, Rama-Tut (a version of Kang in another era), Juggernaut, the Brood, etc. As well as introducing important elements and locations of the Marvel Universe, such as the Serpent Crown, the Twilight Sword, the Darkhold, the Phoenix Force (along with the Dark Phoenix), Time Travel, Wundagore Mountain or the Nova Corps. In addition to species such as the Fire Demons, the Mutants, the Atlanteans, the Inhumans, the New-Men, the Deviants, the Eternals or the Celestials. Including the continuation of the arc of characters or organizations with unfinished plots such as: Surtur, the Enchantress, Wonder Man, Loki, Hydra, Shield, the Masters of Evil, Graviton, Kang the Conqueror, Ultron, etc. There are indications of adapting arcs such as Ragnarok, Dark Phoenix Saga, Evolutionary war, House of M. And that the end of the 3rd season is an adaptation of Heroes Reborn, for which Wanda Maximoff and Jean Gray contained the Phoenix Force in a pocket dimension, where the X-Men would sacrifice themselves to keep it there and there is a connection with the opening scene of the Wolverine and the X-Men. Josh Fine commented that this while he was very entertained by the synopsis he read, they were not discussed by the original writing team. \nAdditionally, regarding the Fourth Season, Cristopher Yost mentioned that the first half would be called \"Under Siege\", while the second half would be dubbed \"Infinity Quest\". The plot of \"Under Siege\" would have been an adaptation of the comic \"Acts of Vengeance\" which would have involved a political and global story, with Dr Doom as the main villain in his quest to conquer the world, bringing together the best supervillains on the planet (probably the Mandarin, Magneto, Red Skull, Kingpin, Wizard and Loki, according to the original comic) to put the Avengers on the run, traveling to many international locations, appearing villains and guest stars from outside the United States; in turn, a Hydra invasion, with the help of Norman Osborn (Green Goblin), to Asgard also had to happen, adapting the Dark Reign and Siege story, and probably appearing the Dark Avengers. The plot of \"Infinity Quest\" would have been about the Elders of the Universe searching for the Infinity Stones to destroy the universe (Earth-8096) and elevating themselves as gods in the new firmament of the multiverse, forcing the Avengers to disperse across the most cosmic corners of the Marvel universe; impliying also the return of Galactus and the introduction of the Beyonder and Molecule Man in this part of the season. In turn, Josh Fine mentioned that the plans for the 4th season included the presentation of the Superhuman Registration Act and that there would be an adaptation of the Civil War as a consequence of the proposals of Maria Hill and Dell Rusk in season 2. \nAs for a Fifth Season, the only thing that has been revealed is the interest in having adapted the Secret Wars arc (with the Beyonders starring), which would have involved all the teams of heroes and villains, along with all the possible characters from Marvel Comics, within a saga that would have spanned the entire season. \nAfter the abrupt cancellation leaving the producers unhappy, and while accepting that it would still be unlikely, Chris Yost and Josh Fine have since discussed their renewed interest in continuing the series.\n\nRelease\nHome media\nReception\nCritical response\nOn the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the first season has a 100% approval rating with an average rating of 7.50 out of 10 based on 5 reviews.\nAllan Scoot of Screen Rant stated that The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes features \"amazing animation and writing that updated the classic origins of the Avengers,\" saying, \"Thankfully, two seasons of EMH still gave fans the best take on Marvel's premiere superhero team that was both comic-accurate and entertaining, complete with an incredibly catchy theme song resulting in the creation of a perfect Avengers cartoon.\" Will Wade of Common Sense Media gave The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes a grade of 3 out of 5 stars, complimented the depiction of positive messages and role models, citing the bravery of the character, asserting, \"There is enough plotting and planning to generate an ongoing storyline and develop the characters in a way that will appeal even to teens and older Marvel fans.\" Alex Zalben of MTV ranked The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes 1st in their \"5 Best Avengers Cartoons Of All Time\" list, writing, \"Earth\u2019s Mightiest Heroes is also the best animated Avengers we\u2019ve seen... It\u2019s faithful to the comics, it\u2019s fun, and it\u2019s ambitious, mixing big story lines, hundreds of characters from the Marvel Universe, and making it work for both kids and adults. Not just the best Avengers cartoon, but possibly one of the best Marvel animated shows - ever.\" \nTrey Pasch of MovieWeb ranked The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes 2nd in their \"Best Marvel Animated Projects\" list and called the show \"immensely popular.\" Jonathon Dornbush and Joshua Rivera of Entertainment Weekly ranked The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes 4th in their \"9 Best Animated TV Series Drawn From Comics\" list, writing, \"With a well-constructed team dynamic, EMH created a familiar yet fresh core cast that complemented the current slate of Marvel live-action properties.\" Michael Doran of Newsarama ranked The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes 10th in their \"10 Best Comic Book Animated Series Of All Time\" list, asserting, \"It's heroes working together, it's crazy over-the-top villainous threats, it's big action, and there was this prevailing sense of happiness over it all.\"\n\nAccolades\nThe Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes was nominated for Best Sound Editing: Television Animation at the 2011 Golden Reel Awards.\n\nIn other media\nComic book\nThe Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes comic book series, written by Christopher Yost, and artwork by Scott Wegener, Christopher Jones and Patrick Scherberger was published to accompany the series. It was a four-issue limited series. An ongoing comic book series titled The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes Adventures debuted in April 2012, alongside the Ultimate Spider-Man Adventures series. Christopher Yost returned as the main writer, with Adam Dekraker serving as the comic's creative team, while Nuno Plati provided artwork.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nThe Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes at IMDb","93":"The Avengers: United They Stand (also known simply as The Avengers) is an animated series based on the Marvel Comics superhero team Avengers. It consists of 13 episodes, which originally premiered on October 30, 1999, and was produced by Avi Arad. It was canceled on February 26, 2000.\nThe series features two founders of the team, Ant-Man and the Wasp, and introduces Wonder Man, Tigra, Hawkeye, Falcon, Vision and Scarlet Witch.\n\nPlot\nThe series features a team broadly based on the roster for the 1984 Avengers spin-off series, the West Coast Avengers, composed of the Wasp, Wonder Man, Tigra, Hawkeye and Scarlet Witch (Hawkeye and Scarlet Witch were also both in the Iron Man animated series as members of Force Works) led by Ant-Man\/Giant-Man, with the Falcon and Vision joining in the opening two-parter. For undetermined reasons (perhaps due to their rights being tied up in planned movie projects), the Avengers' \"Big Three\" were not regular fixtures in the series \u2013 Captain America and Iron Man made only guest appearances in one episode each, while Thor did not appear outside of the opening titles (though he was intended to make an appearance in a future season if the show was renewed). Captain America appears in one episode \"Command Decision\". The story involves the Masters of Evil and a flashback to Captain America defeating Baron Zemo. Meanwhile, Iron Man in the episode \"Shooting Stars\", helps the Avengers thwart the Zodiac's plan to send a radioactive satellite crashing to Earth.\nThe series features many of the Avengers' major comic book foes, including Ultron, Kang the Conqueror, Egghead, the Masters of Evil (consisting of Baron Helmut Zemo, Tiger Shark, Absorbing Man, Moonstone, Whirlwind, Boomerang, Cardinal, and Dragonfly) the Grim Reaper (this version wore full body armor and a helmet featuring a skull-like paint job and a scythe-like weapon on his armor; his ties to Wonder Man remained intact) and the Zodiac, as well as associated characters the Swordsman, the Circus of Crime, Namor, Attuma, Agatha Harkness, and the Salem's Seven.\nThe show made several fan-friendly references to aspects of the characters' comic book history that were otherwise not expanded upon for the uninitiated; such as Falcon and Captain America's partnership, Hawkeye's partial deafness, or Namor's half-breed nature. Beyond this, the series bore little in the way of similarity to the comics, mainly due to its wholesale redesign of the cast, characterized by asymmetrical costume design and the most infamous element of the series \u2013 Ant-Man, Wasp, Hawkeye and Falcon all wore suits of battle armor. Also in this incarnation, Tigra is an athlete who underwent genetic treatments to give her a competitive edge. These treatments went awry, leaving her with the form and abilities of a tiger.\n\nCast\nLinda Ballantyne as Janet Van Dyne \/ Wasp\nTony Daniels as Clint Barton \/ Hawkeye, Aries, Aquarius, Brutacus\nGraham Harley as Edwin Jarvis\nRay Landry as Raymond Sikorski\nCarolyn Larson as The Computer\nStavroula Logothettis as Wanda Maximoff \/ Scarlet Witch\nHamish McEwan as Simon Williams \/ Wonder Man\nGerry Mendicino as Cornelius Van Lunt \/ Taurus\nMartin Roach as Samuel \"Sam\" Wilson \/ Falcon\nRon Ruben as Vision\nJohn Stocker as Ultron\nRod Wilson as Dr. Hank Pym \/ Ant-Man \/ Giant-Man\nLenore Zann as Greer Grant Nelson \/ Tigra\n\nAdditional voices\nDenis Akiyama as Dr. Chris Johnson (in \"Kang\")\nPhilip Akin as Attuma\nOliver Becker as Carl \"Crusher\" Creel \/ Absorbing Man\nWayne Best as Scorpio\nNormand Bissonette as Maynard Tiboldt \/ Ringmaster\nDan Chameroy as Steve Rogers \/ Captain America\nConrad Coates as Remnant Leader (in \"Remnants\")\nRob Cowan as Frederick \"Fred\" Myers \/ Boomerang\nCarlos Diaz as Todd Arliss \/ Tiger Shark\nFrancis Diakowsky as Tony Stark \/ Iron Man\nPaul Essiembre as Jacques Duquesne \/ Swordsman\nNigel Hamer as Gemini: Male Head\nKen Kramer as Kang the Conqueror\nRobert Latimer as Elihas Starr \/ Egghead\nJulie Lemieux as Gemini: Female Head\nStephen Ouimette as Nicholas Scratch\nSusan Roman as Karla Sofen \/ Moonstone, Dragonfly\nTate Roswell as Andrew Wilson (in \"Kang\")\nAllan Royal as Grim Reaper\nElizabeth Shepherd as Agatha Harkness\nPhillip Shepherd as Baron Zemo\nRaoul Trujillo as Namor\nPeter Wildman as Donald Clendenon \/ Cardinal\nPeter Windrem as David Cannon \/ Whirlwind\n\nAppearing in the comics\nOther characters that appeared in the comic but not the show:\n\nNatalia Romanova \/ Black Widow No. 2 and 5\nBaron Strucker #2\nHYDRA #2\nNathan Garrett \/ Black Knight #4 \u2013 Nathan Garrett appears and attempts to steal a device from the organization A.I.M.\nDoctor Doom #4 \u2013 He attempted to execute the Avengers and Black Knight.\nA.I.M. #5\nThe Collector \u2013 He chooses to preserve a good population of Earth as he feels the planet is on the verge of ending. Although the Avengers escape, some citizens on Earth prefer to stay with the Collector.\n\nProduction\nIn 1997, Roland Poindexter, the supervising executive in charge of animated series at Fox Kids Network, approached two X-Men (1992) animated series writers named Robert N. Skir and Marty Isenberg to develop a proposal for an Avengers cartoon. After creating a detailed Bible that included a 13-episode story arc, the network decided a Captain America series would be more suited to its schedule. But before Fox Kids could green light either series, Marvel went into bankruptcy, effectively ending the development process for all its shows. It was not until after the publisher's financial woes were resolved in late 1998 that Poindexter revived interest in the Avengers project, using the series bible written by Robert N. Skir and Marty Isenberg; because Skir and Isenberg were already committed to spearhead Beast Machines: Transformers, the network approached former X-Men animated series story editor Eric Lewald and his wife, Julia, to come on board as story editors for the series. In January 1999, Fox finally gave the official go-ahead and Ron Myrick was hired to oversee the show's visual development.\nThe Avengers roster for the cartoon is loosely based upon the roster for the 1984 Avengers spin-off series The West Coast Avengers. Notably absent from the lineup are the traditional core members: Captain America, Iron Man, and Thor, who were originally prohibited from appearing in the series due to licensing issues. Story editor Eric Lewald has commented on their absence and had said \"We want this to be a team of Avengers, instead of making it 'Captain America and the Avengers' or 'Thor and the Avengers. We prefer to have a balanced team of superheroes rather than a superstar on the team.\" However, Captain America and Iron Man each made one guest appearance (in \"Command Decision\" and \"Shooting Stars\", respectively), while Thor did not appear outside of the opening sequence.\nThe decision to pair Scarlet Witch and Wonder Man up as a couple was based upon the storyline then running in the Avengers comic in which Scarlet Witch resurrects Wonder Man to serve as her protector after an evil sorceress transforms the planet into a medieval world under her control. During their time together, the two fall in love and become a couple.\nIn the promotional images of the series, and the action figure photos, Hawkeye did not wear a mask. However, in the series and the final version of the figure, he wore a mask similar to that he wore during the Avengers: The Crossing storyline.\nThis series was commissioned by Fox in the wake of the success of Batman Beyond (1999). In order to attempt to emulate Batman Beyond, changes were made to the Avengers franchise as the series was set in the future. Myrick explained that they were \"setting the series about twenty-five years in the future\" and that \"New York City will be a mix of future and contemporary looks, sort of the way the city looked in the movie Blade Runner (1982) but not as dark.\" The Avengers were also featured wearing elaborate armor costumes when they went into battle. Myrick explained, \"The armor will give them the capability to go into different environments like extreme heat or cold, or underwater, or outer space, and it'll enhance their abilities.\" The Avengers also featured an \"A\" on their costumes that was like a Star Trek comlink, where they could hit it and communicate with each other and the mansion's computer.\n\nEpisodes\nThe following list reflects the correct viewing order of The Avengers: United They Stand episodes, according to Marvel's official site.\n\nProposed second season\nTentative plans for additional episodes were made that featured Hawkeye's return to the carnival where he grew up as well as an episode exploring how the Scarlet Witch discovered her powers. Plans also included guest appearances by the X-Men, utilizing the Toronto-based cast from the 1990s series as a few of them already worked on this show. Other proposed episode plots include Bruce Banner appearing to help the team when Ant-Man fell ill to gamma radiation exposure during a fight with the villain Egghead, Thor and his brother Loki in a two-part episode (there was even a Thor toy made for the show's line of action figures). However, all plans were scrapped when the show had stopped production.\n\nHome media\nUnited Kingdom\nIn May 2004, Maximum Entertainment released two boxsets which contained the show as well as segments from The Marvel Super Heroes. Both box sets made up all thirteen episodes of the series. On May 21, 2007, the company re-released the series as a standalone DVD release.\nOn April 16, 2012, Clear Vision re-released the series on DVD as a two-disc set.\n\nMerchandise and media\nToys\nToy Biz released a line of action figures for the cartoon series. The figures included Ant-Man, Captain America, Falcon, Hawkeye, Kang, Tigra, Vision, Ultron, Wasp and Wonder Man. Air Glider and Sky Cycle vehicle toys were also produced. In the promotional images of the series, and the action figure photos, Hawkeye did not wear a mask. However, in the series and the final version of the figure, he wore a mask similar to that he wore during the Avengers: The Crossing storyline.\n\nComic book\nThe Avengers: United They Stand comic book series by Ty Templeton and Derec Aucoin was published to accompany the series. Due to low sales it lasted only seven issues.\nThe first two issues are set before the series premiere, Avengers Assemble, Part 1 & 2. No. 1 has the Avengers injured by an early version of Ultron. This issue was used to explain the armor worn by Hawkeye, Wasp and the Falcon in the series, which uses Pym Particles to reduce the pain caused by injury. It is mentioned by Hawkeye that Hank built his own armor after his legs were broken by Dragon Man, and felt no pain in his legs until he removed the armor. No. 3 takes place after the premiere as the Vision is being interviewed about his membership. He is also briefed on how Wonder Man and Hawkeye joined the team.\nThe Black Panther would appear in No. 1 and 6\u20137 of the series. In No. 1 he is among the Avengers who are injured by Ultron. Because of that, he refuses to rejoin the team until Hank steps down from being leader. Captain America appears in #6\u20137 as well. Quicksilver is mentioned twice in the series. In issue 1, Wanda is shown writing a letter to him. Issue 3 shows him in the flashback alongside Captain America, Hawkeye and Scarlet Witch.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nThe Avengers: United They Stand at IMDb\nAvengers Forever: Animated Avengers Cartoon","94":"The Avengers is a 1998 American satirical spy action comedy film directed by Jeremiah Chechik, an adaptation of the 1961\u20131969 British television series of the same name. It stars Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman as secret agents John Steed and Emma Peel, and Sean Connery as Sir August de Wynter, a mad scientist bent on controlling the world's weather. Patrick Macnee, Steed in the original series, makes a vocal cameo as the voice of Invisible Jones.\nThe film underperformed at the box-office, only grossing $54.7 million against its $60 million budget and was met with negative reviews from critics.\n\nPlot\nSecret agent John Steed and meteorologist Dr. Emma Peel are summoned to The Ministry. They meet the spymaster, codenamed Mother, who informs them that the Prospero project \u2014 an attempt to influence the weather \u2014 was apparently sabotaged by Peel. Dr. Peel claims she is innocent, but she is sent to work alongside Steed to find the real culprit. Mother's second-in-command, Father, claims that Peel suffers from a mental disease. The duo visits Sir August de Wynter, a former Ministry scientist. He takes an instant liking to Peel, as they both share a love of weather.\nSteed and Emma follow a lead to Wonderland Weather, a business that artificially creates heat or rain with a special machine, where they discover two dead men in teddy bear suits. The members of a secret organization, led by de Wynter, all don teddy bear suits to disguise their identities. One of them, however, looks exactly like Peel. Steed arrives in time to save Peel, as the double jumps off a roof and disappears.\nSteed and Emma go off to visit de Wynter at his mansion but are attacked by mechanical bees. An elderly Ministry agent, Alice, helps them to flee; nevertheless, de Wynter captures, drugs, and hypnotizes Emma. When de Wynter is later distracted, Emma tries to escape but feels faint and finds herself trapped due to the mansion's ever-changing floor plan. Becoming desperate, she smashes her way through the wall where Steed then finds her unconscious and rescues her. Back at Steed's apartment, Emma wakes up and is fired by Steed. However, Emma is arrested by Father, while Steed visits Invisible Jones, a man inside The Ministry, to investigate the meaning of a map found at Wonderland Weather.\nAfter viewing photos of failed genetic experiments including cloning (revealing that the other Emma Peel is a clone), Steed determines Father is working alongside de Wynter. Father and the Emma clone gas Peel unconscious but are confronted by Mother, whom they incapacitate. De Wynter, controlling the weather using Prospero, confronts the world leaders, boasting that he controls the weather and they will have to buy the weather from him at great expense. He gives them a midnight ultimatum.\nFather and the clone take Peel to a hot air balloon, where she regains consciousness and escapes during a snowstorm. Father and the clone perish when the balloon collides with the Wonderland Weather sign. Once reunited, Steed and Peel share a kiss. Jones determines de Wynter is using the Prospero instruments on a secret island, and Peel and Steed travel there to stop him. Peel defuses the Prospero device just as a hurricane forms over London. Steed duels de Wynter and impales him with his own cane, causing de Wynter to be disintegrated by a powerful bolt of lightning. The duo escapes just as the base self-destructs, and rendezvous with Mother on the roof of a building.\n\nCast\nRalph Fiennes as John Steed, a British Ministry agent\nUma Thurman as Emma Peel, Scientist, Ministry agent\nSean Connery as Sir August de Wynter, a weather scientist and a terrorist\nJim Broadbent as Mother, Director of the Ministry\nFiona Shaw as Father, Deputy Director of the Ministry\nEddie Izzard as Bailey, Sir August's henchman\nEileen Atkins as Alice, a Ministry Agent\nCarmen Ejogo as Brenda, a Ministry Agent, Mother's aide\nJohn Wood as Trubshaw, Steed's tailor\nKeeley Hawes as Tamara, Agent of Sir August\nPatrick Macnee (voice) as Invisible Jones, a Ministry Agent\n\nRelease\nWarner Bros., the film's distributor, refused to allow any early press screenings for movie reviewers. Such a decision is often made when a studio and\/or distributor knows a film will not be received well and pre-release reviews would only be negative. The film was originally scheduled to open earlier in June 1998, but was pushed back until August, often referred to as the \"dumping ground\" for films that are not felt to be strong enough to open on the more lucrative holiday weekends in early summer. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote: There's...some business involving a dead ringer for Emma going around causing trouble, and there's some mention of the word \"cloning\". Then all talk of that is dropped. Everything is dropped. After a slow opening, the 90-minute movie jolts into climax mode. What happened to the middle? Clearly, this wasn't just edited but gutted. No doubt they did us all a favor, but it doesn't help. Instead of just being a bad picture, the missing middle makes The Avengers a bad and weird and strangely off picture. One example: There's never a moment when Emma and Steed realize who the villain is. At first, they don't know. Next, they're in a titanic battle to the death. At one point, Emma is shackled and floating around in a hot-air balloon. I don't know how she got there. I must have blinked.\nDue to internal wrangling at Warner Bros., the decision was made to vastly cut down the running time after test screenings, reducing the 115-minute film to 89 minutes, sacrificing much coherence and continuity in the process. Key scenes removed included the opening sequence in which Mrs. Peel's evil clone infiltrates and destroys the Prospero science installation; early trailers included the scene where she says the words \"How now brown cow\" in a false telephone box to gain admittance; these words are later used in the film when Steed and Peel use them to enter de Wynter's island fortress in another telephone box. The movie was originally scored by composer Michael Kamen, who included the original Avengers theme; however, he was unable to re-score the film after the radical editing, so was forced to drop out. The recut version of the film was scored by Joel McNeely. The original cut has yet to surface; Warner Bros. has no plans to release a director's cut or special edition in any form, despite the fact that director Jeremiah Chechik has offered to recut the film for free.\nThe rock band Radiohead recorded a version of their song \"Man of War\" for the Avengers soundtrack but abandoned it after a failed studio session.\n\nReception\nBox office\nThe film ranked third in its opening weekend behind Saving Private Ryan and How Stella Got Her Groove Back, with $10,305,957. It ultimately grossed $23,384,939 in the United States and Canada and $31.3 million internationally for a worldwide total of $54.7 million. (The-Numbers.com reported a lower international gross of $25.2 million.) With a $60 million budget, it was a box office flop.\n\nCritical response\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes shows a 5% score, based on 83 reviews, with an average rating of 3.20\/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"A TV spinoff that lacks enough energy to spin, The Avengers is an ineptly written, woefully miscast disaster.\" Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 12 out of 100, based on 19 reviews, indicating \"overwhelming dislike\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"D\" on an A+ to F scale.\nFans disliked the film for its disrespect to the series (particularly the introduction of a romance between Steed and Peel \u2014 previously a carefully ambiguous subject). Newcomers were lost by all of the misfired attempts to capture the mood of the original. Rod Dreher in the New York Post called the film \"a big fat gob of maximum crapulosity, the kind of shallow, stupid, big-budget cow pile that smells of Joel Schumacher\", referring to the previous summer's likewise poorly received Batman & Robin, also starring Thurman. David Bianculli stated: \"This Avengers film is so horrendously, painfully, and thoroughly awful that it gives other cinematic clunkers like Ishtar and Howard the Duck a good name.\" Jay Boyer in the Orlando Sentinel said \"The Avengers is, without a doubt, the worst movie of the summer\". Reception in Britain was equally hostile. The Birmingham Post wrote \"The Avengers is being slated by critics as the worst film ever made - such a turkey, says one, that the makers should have handed distribution to (mass turkey producer) Bernard Matthews\". Alan Jones in The Radio Times said \"the cult 1960s TV series gets royally shafted by Hollywood in this stunningly designed blockbuster that's stunningly awful in every other department... Terrible special effects and zero chemistry between Fiennes and Thurman make this notorious disaster a total waste of everyone's time and energy\".\nSeveral critics noted that despite the film being written by Englishman Don Macpherson, the American production team fatally misunderstood the symbols of \"Britishness\" central to The Avengers series, such as the inclusion of an inexplicable gadget on the dashboard of Steed's Bentley, which appeared to dispense tea, with milk already added.\nCommenting on the truncated released cut, The New York Times's Janet Maslin noted: \"At a pared-down, barely rational 90 minutes, The Avengers is short but not short enough\". In 2003, Total Film magazine voted Fiennes and Thurman in The Avengers as \"The Worst Movie Double Act Of All Time\".\n\nAccolades\nThe Avengers was nominated for nine Razzies at the 19th Golden Raspberry Awards: Picture, Director, Screenplay, Supporting Actor (Connery), Actress (Thurman), Actor (Fiennes), Screen Couple (Fiennes and Thurman) and Original Song (\"Storm\"), winning only one for Worst Remake or Sequel.\n\nNovelisation\nThe film's original script was used for its novelization (written by Julie Kaewert) and included all the material which was first shot and then removed from the film.\n\nSee also\nList of films considered the worst\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nThe Avengers at AllMovie\nThe Avengers at Box Office Mojo\nThe Avengers at IMDb\nThe Avengers at Rotten Tomatoes\nThe Avengers at Metacritic","95":"The Avengers is a 1950 American swashbuckler film and adventure film directed by John H.

The music by Richard Addinsell was performed by the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Muir Mathieson.\n\nPlot\nFollowing the Invasion of Poland in September 1939, the former horse racing-correspondent Colin Metcalfe is placed as a foreign correspondent in neutral Norway. Eight months later he meets a Norwegian fisherman, Captain Alstad, in a sailors' bar, where a scuffle breaks out between British and Norwegian sailors (singing \"Rule Britannia\", egged on by Metcalfe) and German ones (singing the Nazi Party anthem the \"Horst-Wessel-Lied\"). Alstad takes him aboard his boat during a sea voyage in Norway's territorial waters, during which they sight the Altmark and are fired upon by a German U-boat, despite Norway's neutrality. They then come back to his home port of Langedal, and Metcalfe goes to Oslo to report this to the British embassy there, despite the best efforts of the German Kommandant and the German-sympathising local police chief Ottoman Gunter. There Metcalfe meets Frank Lockwood en route back to England from the Winter War in Finland. It was Lockwood who had got him the foreign correspondent job at the outbreak of war, but he now passes on the news to Metcalfe that he has been fired from it for sailing out with the fisherman rather than staying on dry land where the paper can contact him. Metcalfe informs the embassy, and also warns his paper of signs that a German war on Norway is imminent. Alstad's daughter Kari (who had accompanied them on their voyage) also meets him to tell him of suspicious German merchant ships at Bergen which her father suspects have troops on board.\nThe pair say goodbye and Metcalfe, getting into what he thinks is a taxi, is kidnapped by the Germans and put on board a ship bound for the German port of Bremen. Meanwhile, Germany invades, Metcalfe is scooped on the news of the invasion, and \u2013 back in Britain \u2013 Chamberlain's government falls and Churchill becomes prime minister. A British warship intercepts the ship on which Metcalfe is held and liberates him but she is re-routed to Cherbourg to help Operation Aerial, the evacuation of British troops from north-western France, before she can get Metcalfe back to Britain. Amidst the carnage on the docks at Cherbourg, Metcalfe finds Lockwood, dying of wounds.\nBack in Britain as the Blitz begins, Metcalfe is persuaded not to join up and instead to start a press campaign for the public to make economies on the Home Front to help win the Battle of the Atlantic. Just about to set out on it, he is called upon by the Admiralty to be parachute-dropped back into Langedal, sabotage a camouflaged U-boat base nearby, and escape across the border into neutral Sweden. On landing, he is spotted and pursued by the Germans, but manages to escape and gain shelter. There he finds that Alstad has been interned by the Germans, and Kari has brought shame on herself by getting engaged to the traitorous Gunter. However, when at a tense \"Norwegian-German friendship dance\" the Germans arrive to demand Metcalfe's papers, Kari saves him by inciting a riot and hiding him at her house. There she reveals she only took on the engagement to obtain her father's release.\nAlstad is released and agrees to help Metcalfe to signal to British bombers with torches to guide them in on their raid on it, and Kari and Metcalfe bid a romantic farewell. The signalling is successful and the base destroyed, but Alstad is killed by a German patrol. Metcalfe returns to tell Kari the news, just as Gunter and the Germans take eight random hostages who will be shot if the British spy they are sheltering is not given up. Metcalfe overhears this, and gives himself up. Gunter returns to Kari to try to save her from the firing squad she too will face for sheltering the spy, but she refuses and is locked up with the hostages, though Gunter shows her the kindness of not separating her from Metcalfe. They prepare to die, and the first party for the firing squad are taken out, but then a British commando raid arrives. In the chaos Gunter is shot by the Kommandant as the latter makes a hasty escape, and the hostages are all freed unharmed. The raiders capture the town and its German garrison and then leave almost immediately, taking Metcalfe, Kari, the hostages and their families to safety in England.\n\nCast\nMain source is the BFI.\n\nCritical reception\nTwo reviews written in the 21st century were generally positive.\nDavid Parkinson gave the film three out of five stars in the Radio Times, and wrote, \"Markedly less restrained than many other British tales of wartime resistance, this well-meaning flag-waver is far more effective than the majority of have-a-go Hollywood movies on the same theme...what sets this apart is a remarkable cast of British stalwarts, not one of whom puts a foot wrong. Special mention should be made, however, of Deborah Kerr, who lends quiet courage to an unrewarding romantic part, and Francis L Sullivan, who makes a most malevolent Nazi\".\nThe reviewer for The Movie Scene rated the film similarly, although finding it \"incredibly dated,\" but went on to say that it, \"does feature a good storyline which is well knit together. It is still entertaining and you can see how it would have served its purpose of rallying British audiences back in the 1940s.\"\n\nReferences\nNotes\n\nExternal links\nThe Day Will Dawn at IMDb\nThe Avengers at the TCM Movie Database\nThe Day Will Dawn at AllMovie","98":"Marvel's The Avengers (titled Marvel Avengers Assemble in the United Kingdom and Ireland and commonly referred to as simply The Avengers) is a 2012 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the sixth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Written and directed by Joss Whedon, the film features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, and Jeremy Renner as the Avengers, alongside Tom Hiddleston, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, and Samuel L. Jackson. In the film, Nick Fury and the spy agency S.H.I.E.L.D. recruit Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Bruce Banner, Thor, Natasha Romanoff, and Clint Barton to form a team capable of stopping Thor's brother Loki from subjugating Earth.\nThe film's development began when Marvel Studios received a loan from Merrill Lynch in April 2005. After the success of the film Iron Man in May 2008, Marvel announced that The Avengers would be released in July 2011 and would bring together Stark (Downey), Rogers (Evans), Banner (at the time portrayed by Edward Norton), and Thor (Hemsworth) from Marvel's previous films. With the signing of Johansson as Romanoff in March 2009, Renner as Barton in June 2010, and Ruffalo replacing Norton as Banner in July 2010, the film was pushed back for a 2012 release. Whedon was brought on board in April 2010 and rewrote the original screenplay by Zak Penn. Production began in April 2011 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, before moving to Cleveland, Ohio in August and New York City in September. The film has more than 2,200 visual effects shots.\nThe Avengers premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on April 11, 2012, and was released in the United States on May 4, as the final film in Phase One of the MCU. The film received praise for Whedon's direction and screenplay, visual effects, action sequences, acting, and musical score. It grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide, setting numerous box office records and becoming the third-highest-grossing film of all time at the time of its release and the highest-grossing film of 2012. It was the first Marvel production to generate $1 billion in ticket sales. In 2017, The Avengers was featured as one of the 100 greatest films of all time in an Empire magazine poll. It received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 85th Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. Three sequels have been released: Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019).\n\nPlot\nThe Asgardian Loki encounters the Other, the leader of an extraterrestrial race known as the Chitauri. In exchange for obtaining the Tesseract, a powerful energy source of unknown potential, the Other promises to provide Loki with an army to conquer Earth. Nick Fury, director of the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D., arrives at a remote research facility where physicist Dr. Erik Selvig is leading a team studying the Tesseract. It suddenly activates and opens a wormhole, allowing Loki to reach Earth. Loki steals the Tesseract and uses his scepter to enslave Selvig and other agents, including Clint Barton, to aid him.\nIn response, Fury reactivates the \"Avengers Initiative\". Agent Natasha Romanoff travels to Kolkata to recruit Dr. Bruce Banner so he can trace the Tesseract through its gamma radiation emissions. Fury approaches Steve Rogers to discuss his knowledge of the Tesseract, and Agent Phil Coulson visits Tony Stark so he can check Selvig's research. Loki is in Stuttgart, where Barton steals iridium needed to stabilize the Tesseract. This leads to a confrontation with Rogers, Stark, and Romanoff that ends with Loki's surrender. While Loki is being escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., his adoptive brother Thor arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard. Stark and Rogers intervene, and Loki is imprisoned in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the Helicarrier.\nThe Avengers disagree on how to approach Loki and become argumentative once they realize S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to use the Tesseract to create weapons of mass destruction to use against hostile extraterrestrials. During the argument, Loki's agents attack the Helicarrier, and the stress causes Banner to transform into the Hulk. Stark and Rogers restart the damaged engine while Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage. Romanoff subdues Barton, freeing him from Loki's influence. Loki escapes after mortally wounding Coulson. Fury uses Coulson's subsequent death to motivate the Avengers to work together as a team. Loki uses the Tesseract and a generator Selvig built to open a wormhole above Stark Tower in New York City to bring his Chitauri fleet and start his invasion.\nRogers, Stark, Romanoff, Barton, Thor, and the Hulk work together to protect New York from the Chitauri. The Hulk incapacitates Loki while Romanoff learns from Selvig, now freed from Loki's mind control, that Loki's scepter can shut down the generator. Fury's superiors from the World Security Council attempt to end the invasion by launching a nuclear missile at Midtown Manhattan. Stark intercepts the missile and flies it through the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet. The missile destroys the Chitauri mothership and disables their forces on Earth. Stark becomes unconscious, and his suit loses power, leaving him freefalling towards Earth. The Avengers manage to resuscitate him, while Romanoff uses Loki's scepter to close the wormhole. In the aftermath, Thor transports an imprisoned Loki and the Tesseract to Asgard, where Loki will face Asgardian justice.\nIn a mid-credits scene, the Other confers with his master about the failed attack on Earth.\n\nCast\nRobert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark \/ Iron Man: A self-described genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist who wears an electromechanical suit of armor of his own invention. Downey was cast as part of his four-picture deal with Marvel Studios, which included Iron Man 2 (2010) and The Avengers. He initially suggested to Whedon that Stark should be the lead character, stating, \"Well, I said, 'I need to be in the opening sequence. I don't know what you're thinking, but Tony needs to drive this thing.' He was like, 'Okay, let's try that.' We tried it and it didn't work, because this is a different sort of thing, the story and the idea and the theme is the theme, and everybody is just an arm of the octopus.\" Downey commented on the character's evolution, stating, \"In Iron Man, which was an origin story, he was his own epiphany and redemption of sorts. Iron Man 2 is all about not being an island, dealing with legacy issues and making space for others. . . In The Avengers, he's throwing it down with the others\". Downey earned $50 million from the film, \"once box-office bonuses and backend compensation [were] factored in\".\nChris Evans as Steve Rogers \/ Captain America: A World War II veteran who was enhanced to the peak of human physicality by an experimental serum and frozen in suspended animation before waking up in the modern world. Evans was cast as part of a deal to star in three Marvel films, including The Avengers. Rogers is depicted as darker in The Avengers, with Evans stating, \"It's just about him trying to come to terms with the modern world. You've got to imagine, it's enough of a shock to accept the fact that you're in a completely different time, but everybody you know is dead. Everybody you cared about. . . He was a soldier, obviously, everybody he went to battle with, all of his brothers in arms, they're all dead. He's just lonely. I think in the beginning it's a fish-out-of-water scene, and it's tough. It's a tough pill for him to swallow. Then comes trying to find a balance with the modern world.\" Evans also discussed the dynamic between Rogers and Tony Stark, saying, \"I think there's certainly a dichotomy\u2014this kind of friction between myself and Tony Stark, they're polar opposites. One guy is flash and spotlight and smooth, and the other guy is selfless and in the shadows and kind of quiet and they have to get along. They explore that, and it's pretty fun.\" Evans earned $2\u20133 million for the film.\nMark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner \/ Hulk: A genius scientist who, due to exposure to gamma radiation, transforms into a monster when enraged or agitated. Ruffalo, initially considered for the role in The Incredible Hulk (2008) before Edward Norton took on the part, was cast after negotiations between Marvel and Norton fell through. Reflecting on replacing Norton, Ruffalo stated, \"I'm a friend of Ed's, and yeah, that wasn't a great way for all that to go down. But the way I see it is that Ed has bequeathed this part to me. I look at it as my generation's Hamlet.\" Discussing the character, he explained, \"He's a guy struggling with two sides of himself\u2014the dark and the light\u2014and everything he does in his life is filtered through issues of control. I grew up on the Bill Bixby TV series, which I thought was a really nuanced and real human way to look at the Hulk. I like that the part has those qualities.\" Ruffalo described the Hulk's role on the team, stating, \"He's like the teammate none of them are sure they want on their team. He's a loose cannon. It's like, 'Just throw a grenade in the middle of the group and let's hope it turns out well!'\" This is the first production in which the actor playing Banner also plays the Hulk. Ruffalo expressed excitement about the prospect, saying, \"I'm really excited. No one's ever played the Hulk exactly; they've always done CGI. They're going to do the Avatar stop-action, stop-motion capture. So I'll actually play the Hulk. That'll be fun.\" The 3D model used to create the Hulk's body was based on Long Island bodybuilder and male stripper Steve Romm, while Ruffalo's face served as the model for the Hulk's facial features. To produce the Hulk's voice, Ruffalo's voice was combined with those of Lou Ferrigno and others; however, Ruffalo provided the Hulk's sole speaking line (\"Puny god.\") himself. Ruffalo earned $2\u20133 million for his role in the film.\nChris Hemsworth as Thor: The crown prince of Asgard, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name. Hemsworth was cast as part of a multiple movie deal. He had previously collaborated with Joss Whedon on The Cabin in the Woods (2011). Hemsworth maintained his physique from Thor (2011) by consuming a high-protein diet consisting of chicken breasts, fish, steak, and eggs daily. When asked about the quantity, he humorously replied, \"My body weight in protein pretty much!\" Thor's motivation in The Avengers is described by Hemsworth as personal, as it involves his brother's disruptive actions. He explained, \"It's much more of a personal one, in the sense that it's his brother that is stirring things up. Whereas everyone else, it's some bad guy who they've gotta take down. It's a different approach for me, or for Thor. He's constantly having to battle the greater good and what he should do vs. it's his little brother there. . . I've been frustrated with my brothers at times, or family, but I'm the only one who is allowed to be angry at them. There's a bit of that.\" Hemsworth earned $2\u20133 million for his role in the film.\nScarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff \/ Black Widow:  A highly trained spy working for S.H.I.E.L.D. Johansson discussed her character's relationship with Hawkeye, stating, \"Our characters have a long history. They've fought together for a long time in a lot of battles in many different countries. We're the two members of this avenging group who are skilled warriors \u2013 we have no superpowers. Black Widow is definitely one of the team, though. She's not in the cast simply to be a romantic foil or eye candy. She's there to fight, so I never felt like I was the only girl. We all have our various skills and it feels equal.\" Regarding her training for the role, Johansson mentioned, \"Even though Iron Man 2 was 'one-for-them,' I'd never done anything like that before. I'd never been physically driven in something, or a part of something so big. For The Avengers, I've spent so many months training with our stunt team, and fighting all the other actors, it's crazy. I do nothing but fight\u2014all the time.\" Johansson earned $4\u20136 million for her portrayal in the film.\nJeremy Renner as Clint Barton \/ Hawkeye: A master archer working as an agent for S.H.I.E.L.D. Renner prepared for the physically demanding role by training extensively and practicing archery. He expressed his appreciation for Hawkeye's character, stating, \"When I saw Iron Man, I thought that was a really kick-ass approach to superheroes. Then they told me about this Hawkeye character, and I liked how he wasn't really a superhero; he's just a guy with a high skill set. I could connect to that.\" Regarding Hawkeye's relationship with Natasha Romanoff, Renner explained, \"It's a lonely game. He's an outcast. His only connection is to Scarlett's character, Natasha. It's like a left hand\/right hand thing. They coexist, and you need them both, especially when it comes to a physical mission.\" Renner emphasized that Hawkeye is confident in his abilities and not insecure about his humanity, stating, \"Quite the opposite, he's the only one who can really take down the Hulk with his [tranquilizer-tipped] arrows. He knows his limitations. But when it comes down to it, there has to be a sense of confidence in any superhero.\" Renner earned $2\u20133 million for his role in the film.\nTom Hiddleston as Loki: Thor's adoptive brother and nemesis, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name. Hiddleston reflected on his character's evolution from the film Thor, stating, \"I think the Loki we see in The Avengers is further advanced. You have to ask yourself the question: How pleasant an experience is it disappearing into a wormhole that has been created by some kind of super nuclear explosion of his own making? So I think by the time Loki shows up in The Avengers, he's seen a few things.\" Regarding Loki's motivations, Hiddleston explained, \"At the beginning of The Avengers, he comes to Earth to subjugate it and his idea is to rule the human race as their king. And like all the delusional autocrats of human history, he thinks this is a great idea because if everyone is busy worshipping him, there will be no wars so he will create some kind of world peace by ruling them as a tyrant. But he is also kind of deluded in the fact that he thinks unlimited power will give him self-respect, so I haven't let go of the fact that he is still motivated by this terrible jealousy and kind of spiritual desolation.\"\nStellan Skarsg\u00e5rd as Erik Selvig: An astrophysicist and friend of Thor under Loki's control who is studying the Tesseract's power. Skarsg\u00e5rd commented on Loki's control over Selvig, stating, \"Well with the scene we did in Thor, it was like Loki, one way or the other, entered Erik's mind. And in Avengers, you will see more clarity in how Loki is using Erik's mind.\" Regarding his role, he added, \"[My character] is of importance but the size of the role is not big.\"\nSamuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury:  The director of S.H.I.E.L.D. who was revealed in previous films to be coordinating the \"Avengers Initiative\". Jackson was brought to the project with a deal containing an option to play the character in up to nine Marvel films. Jackson expressed that he has a more significant role in The Avengers compared to previous films: \"You don't have to wait until the end of the movie to see me\". Reflecting on the role, Jackson stated, \"It's always good to play somebody [who] is a positive in society as opposed to somebody who is a negative. . . I tried to make him as honest to the story and as honest to what real-life would seem.\" He likened the character to Ordell Robbie in Jackie Brown, describing him as \"a nice guy to hang out with. You just don't want to cross him\". Jackson earned $4\u20136 million for the film.\nClark Gregg appears as Phil Coulson, a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent overseeing many of the division's field operations. Gregg was cast as part of a multi-picture deal with Marvel. He noted that his role was expanded in The Avengers, expressing: \"[What] Agent Coulson had become in terms of the import of this particular story, and how important his job is in bringing the Avengers together, it kind of felt a little surreal, like somebody was playing a prank and that wasn't the real script. But it wasn't, it was the real thing, I got to show up and do that stuff, and it felt like such an amazing payoff to what the journey had been and the fact I had been doing it for five years.\" Gregg said Whedon provided insight into his character's backstory, particularly about Coulson being a fan of Captain America. Cobie Smulders appears as Maria Hill, a high-ranking S.H.I.E.L.D. agent working closely with Nick Fury. Smulders, initially considered by Whedon for his unproduced live-action Wonder Woman film, was selected from a short list of potential actresses including Morena Baccarin. Her deal integrated her into nine films. Regarding her preparation, Smulders said, \"I hired this amazing black-ops trainer to teach me how to hold a gun, take me to a shooting range, how to hit, how to hold myself, how to walk and basically how to look. I don't do a ton of fighting in the movie, which is why I wasn't offered a trainer, but I wanted to look like I had the ability to.\" On relating to the character, Smulders said, \"I can relate to her being a mom and being a businesswoman and trying to work full-time and raising a family and having a career. We're asked to do a lot of things these days. I feel she is just all about her job and keeping things going.\"\nGwyneth Paltrow and Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez reprise their roles as Pepper Potts and Jasper Sitwell, respectively, from previous MCU films. Paul Bettany returns to voice J.A.R.V.I.S. Frequent Whedon collaborator Alexis Denisof portrays \"the Other\", while Damion Poitier portrays his master, Thanos (unnamed in the film), in a post-credits scene. Powers Boothe and Jenny Agutter appear as members of the World Security Council, later revealed to be Gideon Malick and Councilwoman Hawley. Avengers co-creator Stan Lee makes a cameo appearance in a news report. Additionally, Harry Dean Stanton cameos as a security guard, and Polish film director Jerzy Skolimowski appears as Georgi Luchkov, Romanoff's interrogator. Warren Kole has a brief role as a S.H.I.E.L.D. bridge tech who is caught playing Galaga. Enver Gjokaj, who later went on to play Daniel Sousa in the series Agent Carter, appears as a police officer.\n\nProduction\nDevelopment\nIdeas for a film based on the Avengers began in 2003, with Avi Arad, the CEO of Marvel Studios, first announcing plans to develop the film in April 2005, after Marvel Enterprises declared independence by allying with Merrill Lynch to produce a slate of films that would be distributed by Paramount Pictures. Marvel discussed their plans in a brief presentation to Wall Street analysts; the studio's intention was to release individual films for the main characters to establish their identities and familiarize audiences with them before merging the characters together in a crossover film. Screenwriter Zak Penn, who wrote The Incredible Hulk, became attached to the film in 2006, and was hired by Marvel Studios to write the film in June 2007. In the wake of the 2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike, Marvel negotiated with the Writers Guild of America to ensure that it could create films based on its comic book counterparts, including Captain America, Ant-Man, and The Avengers. After the successful release of Iron Man (2008) in May, the company set a July 2011 release date for The Avengers. In September 2008, Marvel Studios reached an agreement with Paramount\u2014an extension of a previous partnership\u2014which gave the company distribution rights for five future Marvel films.\nCasting began in October 2008 with Downey's signing. Although Don Cheadle was reported to reprise his Iron Man 2 role of War Machine for The Avengers, he later stated that he did not think the character would appear in the film. Simultaneously, two major developments occurred for Marvel: Jon Favreau was brought in as an executive producer for the film, and the company signed a long-term lease with Raleigh Studios to produce three other big-budget films\u2014Iron Man 2, Thor, and Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)\u2014at their Manhattan Beach, California complex. In February 2009, Samuel L. Jackson signed a nine-picture deal with Marvel Entertainment to play Nick Fury in Iron Man 2 and other films. In September 2009, Edward Norton, who played Bruce Banner in The Incredible Hulk, stated he was open to returning in the film. The next month, executive producer Jon Favreau stated he would not direct the film but would \"definitely have input and a say\". Favreau also expressed concerns, stating, \"It's going to be hard, because I was so involved in creating the world of Iron Man, and Iron Man is very much a tech-based hero, and then with Avengers, you're going to be introducing some supernatural aspects because of Thor [...] [Mixing] the two of those works very well in the comic books, but it's going to take a lot of thoughtfulness to make that all work and not blow the reality that we've created\". In March 2009, Scarlett Johansson replaced Emily Blunt in portraying Natasha Romanoff in Iron Man 2, a deal that subsequently attached her to The Avengers. The following day, Marvel announced that the film's release date had been pushed back to May 4, 2012, almost a full year later. Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston joined the film's cast in June, returning as Thor and Loki, respectively.\nIn July 2009, Penn discussed the crossover process, stating, \"My job is to kind of shuttle between the different movies and make sure that finally we're mimicking that comic book structure where all of these movies are connected. . . There's just a board that tracks 'Here's where everything that happens in this movie overlaps with that movie'. . . I'm pushing them to do as many animatics as possible to animate the movie, to draw boards so that we're all working off the same visual ideas. But the exigencies of production take first priority\". Initially, Penn attempted to reduce Thor's role in the script due to doubts about the character's ability to succeed on film. However, he changed his mind once Hemsworth was cast as Thor. Although the film always intended to use Loki as its villain, Penn noted that early discussions had considered using Red Skull.\nIn January 2010, Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige was asked if it would be challenging to blend the fantasy of Thor with the high-tech science fiction in Iron Man and The Avengers. \"No,\" he said, \"because we're doing the Jack Kirby\/Stan Lee\/Walt Simonson\/J. Michael Straczynski Thor. We're not doing the blow-the-dust-off-of-the-old-Norse-book-in-your-library Thor. And in the Thor of the Marvel Universe, there's a race called the Asgardians. And we're linked through this Tree of Life that we're unaware of. It's real science, but we don't know about it yet. The 'Thor' movie is about teaching people that\". In March, it was reported that Penn had completed the first draft of the script, and that Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada and Avengers comic-book writer Brian Michael Bendis had received copies. Also in March, Chris Evans accepted an offer to play Captain America in three films including The Avengers.\n\nPre-production\nBy April 2010, Joss Whedon was nearing the completion of a deal to direct the film and to revise Penn's script, and was officially announced in July 2010. Regarding the hiring, Arad stated: \"My personal opinion is that Joss will do a fantastic job. He loves these characters and is a fantastic writer [...] It's part of his life so you know he is going to protect it [...] I expect someone like him is going to make the script even better\". Feige added, \"I've known Joss for many years. We were looking for the right thing and he came in and met on it [...] we want[ed] to find a director that's on the verge of doing something great, as we think Joss is.\" Whedon stated at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con that what drew him to the film is that he loves how \"these people shouldn't be in the same room let alone on the same team\u2014and that is the definition of family\".\nWhen Whedon received Penn's draft, he told Feige he felt the studio did not \"have anything\" and they should \"pretend this draft never happened\". Part of Whedon's issue was the lack of character connections in Penn's draft, which necessitated Whedon to begin \"at square one\". Whedon went on to write a five-page treatment of his plan for the film and created the tagline \"Avengers: Some Assembly Required\", riffing on the \"Avengers Assemble\" slogan from the comic books. Marvel quickly began working to sign Whedon to write and direct, only stipulating that he include the Avengers against Loki, a battle among the heroes in the middle, a battle against the villains at the end, and that he get the film done for its May 2012 release. The script went through \"a lot of insane iterations of what might be\", according to Whedon. There was a point when it was not certain Johansson would star in the film, so he \"wrote a huge bunch of pages starring The Wasp\", and wanted Zooey Deschanel to play the character. He also was \"worried that one British character actor [(Hiddleston)] was not enough to take on Earth's mightiest heroes, and that we'd feel like we were rooting for the overdog. So I wrote a huge draft with Ezekiel Stane, Obadiah Stane's son, in it.\" Once all of the actors were \"locked in place the movie stayed on mission.\" Whedon noted that the characters used do not have the same issue, unlike the X-Men. He felt \"these guys just don't belong together\" before realizing their interactions could be like The Dirty Dozen (1967). Whedon also referenced Dr. Strangelove (1964), The Abyss (1989), His Girl Friday (1940), and Black Hawk Down (2001). Whedon would ultimately share final screenplay credit with Penn, though Whedon noted he \"fought\" for sole credit and was \"very upset about it.\" Penn felt the two \"could have collaborated more, but that was not his choice. He wanted to do it his way, and I respect that.\"\n\nThe casting process continued throughout much of 2010, with the additions of Jeremy Renner, Mark Ruffalo, and Clark Gregg. Ruffalo replaced Edward Norton, whom Marvel declined to bring back. \"We have made the decision to not bring Ed Norton back to portray the title role of Bruce Banner in The Avengers,\" stated Feige. \"Our decision is definitely not one based on monetary factors, but instead rooted in the need for an actor who embodies the creativity and collaborative spirit of our other talented cast members. The Avengers demands players who thrive working as part of an ensemble, as evidenced by Robert, Chris H, Chris E, Samuel, Scarlett, and all of our talented casts. We are looking to announce a name actor who fulfills these requirements, and is passionate about the iconic role in the coming weeks.\" In response, Norton's agent Brian Swardstrom decried Feige's statement, calling it \"purposefully misleading\" and an \"inappropriate attempt to paint our client in a negative light\". In October 2014, Norton claimed it was his own decision never to play Hulk again because he \"wanted more diversity\" with his career and did not want to be associated with only one character.\nIn August 2010, it was reported that Paramount Pictures and Marvel Studios were planning to start shooting in February. In October 2010, Grumman Studios in Bethpage, New York and the Steiner Studios in Brooklyn, New York City, were announced as filming locations, with set construction slated to begin in November, but as Whedon later explained, \"Originally we were supposed to be in Los Angeles, then for a short period we were supposed to be in New York, and then somehow we ended up in Albuquerque.\" Also that October, Walt Disney Studios agreed to pay Paramount at least $115 million for the worldwide distribution rights to Iron Man 3 (2013) and The Avengers. The deal also allowed Paramount to continue to collect the 8 percent box office fee it would have earned for distributing the film and a marquee credit\u2014placement of the company's production logo on marketing materials and the film's opening titles. As a result, the onscreen production credit reads \"Marvel Studios presents in association with Paramount Pictures\", though the film is solely owned, distributed, financed, and marketed by Disney. Paramount's Epix retained pay TV rights.\nIn December 2010, Governor of New Mexico Bill Richardson and Marvel Studios Co-president Louis D'Esposito announced that The Avengers would primarily film in Albuquerque, New Mexico, with principal photography scheduled for April through September 2011. Parts of the film were also slated to be shot in Michigan, but plans to film in Detroit were scrapped after Governor Rick Snyder proposed a budget that would eliminate a film tax incentive. Three months later, in March, Governor of Ohio John Kasich announced during Mayor Frank G. Jackson's State of the City address that The Avengers would also film in Cleveland.\nConcept illustrator and designer of Iron Man's Mark VII armor, Phil Saunders, stated that \"Joss Whedon was looking for something that had the 'cool' factor of the suitcase suit [from Iron Man 2], while still being a fully armored, heavy-duty suit that could take on an army in the final battle.\" To achieve this, Saunders combined ideas proposed in Iron Man 2 with some concepts abandoned in the first Iron Man film, creating a modular suit featuring large ammo packets on the arms and a backpack. Additionally, the Science & Entertainment Exchange provided science consultation for the film.\nCasting reached its final stages the following year. In February 2011, Cobie Smulders was cast in the role of Maria Hill, after participating in screen tests conducted by Marvel for the role of a key S.H.I.E.L.D. member, whom Samuel L. Jackson described as Nick Fury's sidekick. Morena Baccarin, Jessica Lucas, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead were also considered for the role. Over the successive months, the film's cast expanded to include Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, Paul Bettany, and Gwyneth Paltrow. Paltrow was cast at Downey's insistence; prior to this, Whedon had not intended the film to include supporting characters from the heroes' individual films, commenting, \"You need to separate the characters from their support systems in order to create the isolation you need for a team.\"\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began on April 25, 2011, at Albuquerque Studios in Albuquerque, New Mexico, with the working title Group Hug. In June 2011, stuntman Jeremy Fitzgerald sustained a head injury while attempting a stunt involving a 30-foot fall from a building after being struck by an arrow. Despite the injury, Fitzgerald recovered and resumed work on set, as confirmed by a Marvel spokesperson to TMZ. Second unit filming occurred in the Butler area, about an hour outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the following month. Additionally, a chase sequence was shot in Worthington, Pennsylvania, at Creekside Mushroom Farms, which provided 150 miles of abandoned limestone tunnels 300 feet below the ground for filming.\nProduction shifted to Cleveland, Ohio in August 2011, where filming spanned four weeks. The city's East 9th Street was selected as a stand-in for New York City's 42nd Street, serving as the backdrop for climactic battle scenes. Army Reserve soldiers from the 391st Military Police Battalion, based in Columbus, Ohio, participated in the background action during the battle scenes in Cleveland. Staff Sergeant Michael T. Landis noted that the involvement of real soldiers enhanced the realism of the scenes and portrayed the military positively, citing their ability to provide on-the-spot corrections to tactics and uniforms. The NASA Plum Brook Station near Sandusky, Ohio, specifically its Space Power Facility, doubled as a S.H.I.E.L.D. research facility. Filming also occurred at the Chevrolet powertrain plant in Parma, Ohio, where a series of explosions were captured for the battle sequence originating in Cleveland. Additional scenes were shot at Public Square and the Detroit\u2013Superior Bridge, with Public Square's southwest quadrant transformed into Stuttgart, Germany for filming.\nPrincipal photography concluded in New York City, where filming took place over a span of two days. Filming locations included Park Avenue and Central Park. To capture scenes set in Manhattan, visual effects supervisor Jake Morrison spent over three days shooting aerial footage to use as background plates. Morrison emphasized the importance of incorporating real imagery into the effects work to enhance realism, stating, \"There is no substitute for starting with a real image and adding what you need.\"\nCinematographer Seamus McGarvey explained that he chose a 1.85:1 aspect ratio to accommodate the varying heights of the main characters. He said, \"Shooting 1.85:1 is kind of unusual for an epic film like this, but we needed the height in the screen to be able to frame in all the characters like Hulk, Captain America and Black Widow, who is much smaller. We had to give them all precedence and width within the frame. Also, Joss [Whedon] knew the final battle sequence was going to be this extravaganza in Manhattan, so the height and vertical scale of the buildings was going to be really important.\" This film marked McGarvey's first experience using a digital camera, specifically the Arri Alexa. Additionally, the Canon EOS 5D Mark II and Canon EOS 7D digital SLR cameras were employed for certain shots, while high-speed shots were captured on 35 mm film using the Arriflex 435. McGarvey emphasized a visual approach focused on immersion and naturalism, stating, \"Joss and I were keen on having a very visceral and naturalistic quality to the image. We wanted this to feel immersive and did not want a 'comic book look' that might distance an audience with the engagement of the film. We moved the camera a lot on Steadicam, cranes and on dollies to create kinetic images; and we chose angles that were dramatic, like low angles for heroic imagery.\"\n\nPost-production\nIn December 2011, Disney announced the film would undergo a conversion to 3D. According to Whedon, \"I'm not a big fan of extreme long lens, talky movies \u2013 I like to see the space I'm in and relate to it, so 3D kinda fits my aesthetic anyway. And the technology has advanced so far in the past couple years.\" Whedon also noted, \"there definitely are movies that shouldn't be in 3D\", but stated, \"The Avengers isn't obnoxiously 3D. There's no, 'Oh look, we're going to spend 20 minutes going through this tunnel because it's in 3D!' And no one is pointing at the screen the entire time. But it's an action movie. Things tend to hurtle toward the screen anyway.\" In January 2012, it was reported that the film would undergo digital remastering for IMAX 3D and would open in IMAX theaters on May 4, 2012, the same day as its regular theater release. This IMAX release followed Marvel's earlier IMAX releases of Iron Man 2 and Thor. Initially, when the film was submitted to the Motion Picture Association of America's rating board, it received an R rating due to Phil Coulson's death scene. The scene was subsequently edited to secure a PG-13 rating.\nIn a May 2012 interview, Whedon revealed that it was his decision to include Thanos in a post-credits scene, even though the character is not identified in the film. \"He for me is the most powerful and fascinating Marvel villain. He's the great grand daddy of the badasses and he's in love with Death and I just think that's so cute. For me, the greatest Avengers [comic book] was Avengers Annual #7 (1977) that Jim Starlin did followed by Marvel Two-in-One Annual #2 (1977) that contained the death of Adam Warlock. Those were some of the most important texts and I think underrated milestones in Marvel history and Thanos is all over that, so somebody had to be in control and had to be behind Loki's work and I was like 'It's got to be Thanos.' And they said 'Okay' and I'm like 'Oh my God!'\" Additionally, an extra scene featuring the Avengers enjoying shawarma was filmed on April 12, 2012, a day after the world premiere. Evans wore a prosthetic jaw during the scene to conceal the beard he had grown. Following the film's release, shawarma sales in Los Angeles, St. Louis, and Boston reportedly saw a significant surge. Whedon explained that the inspiration for the shawarma scene came from the aftermath of filming a scene in the Angel episode \"A Hole in the World\" where Fred dies in Wesley's arms. After filming, Whedon, along with actors Amy Acker and Denisof, who played Fred and Wesley respectively, \"went out for drinks and ended up just sitting around quietly, exhausted from the day's events\", an experience that Whedon recreated in the film's scene.\n\nThe film features over 2,200 visual effects shots completed by 14 companies: Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Weta Digital, Scanline VFX, Hydraulx, Fuel VFX, Evil Eye Pictures, Luma Pictures, Cantina Creative, Trixter, Modus FX, Whiskytree, Digital Domain, The Third Floor, and Method Design. ILM was the lead vendor and shared responsibility for creating many of the film's key effects, including the Helicarrier, the New York cityscape, digital body doubles, Iron Man, and the Hulk. To bring the Hulk to life on screen, Ruffalo performed in a motion-capture suit on set alongside the other actors, while four motion-capture HD cameras (two capturing his full body and two focused on his face) recorded his facial and body movements. Jeff White, ILM's visual effects supervisor, aimed for a more realistic depiction of the Hulk compared to the one seen in Ang Lee's 2003 film, stating, \"We really wanted to utilize everything we've developed the last 10 years and make it a pretty spectacular Hulk. One of the great design decisions was to incorporate Mark Ruffalo into the look of him. So, much of Hulk is based on Ruffalo and his performance, not only in motion capture and on set, but down to his eyes, his teeth, and his tongue.\"\nILM digitally recreated the majority of the New York cityscape featured in the film, covering approximately ten city blocks by four city blocks. To accomplish this, ILM dispatched a team of four photographers for an eight-week shoot to capture images of the area. Tyson Bidner, the New York location manager for the film, played a crucial role in securing the rights to nearly every building's likeness needed by ILM. Initially, there were plans to include OsCorp Tower from The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) in the film, as Disney and Sony Pictures had agreed to it. However, this idea was abandoned because much of the skyline had already been finalized.\nWeta Digital assumed responsibility for animating Iron Man during the forest duel, taking over from ILM. Guy Williams, Weta's visual effects supervisor, explained, \"We shared assets back and forth with ILM, but our pipelines are unique and it's hard for other assets to plug into it. But in this case, we got their models and we had to redo the texture spaces because the way we texture maps is different.\" Williams highlighted that the most challenging aspect was reproducing Iron Man's reflective metal surfaces.\nScanline VFX handled the reveal shots of the Helicarrier, from Black Widow and Captain America's arrival on the carrier deck to its lift-off. Evil Eye Pictures integrated digital backgrounds into greenscreen footage for scenes set inside the Helicarrier. Colin Strause from Hydraulx mentioned their contribution, stating, \"We did the opening ten minutes of the movie, other than the opening set-up in space\", covering Loki's arrival on Earth and his subsequent escape from the S.H.I.E.L.D. base. Luma Pictures focused on the Helicarrier's bridge shots and integrated the graphic monitor displays developed by Cantina Creative. Fuel VFX handled shots in and around Tony Stark's penthouse at Stark Tower. Digital Domain crafted the asteroid environment where Loki encounters The Other. Method Design, based in Los Angeles, was responsible for the film's closing credits. Steve Viola, creative director at Method Design, described it as \"a two-minute, self-contained main on end sequence created entirely in CG\". He explained that they designed, modeled, textured, and lit all environments and many foreground objects for each shot. Assets from Marvel were modified extensively to create a post-battle macro sequence. Method Design also crafted a custom typeface for the main title of The Avengers as well as 30 in-scene credits.\n\nMusic\nIn November 2011, Marvel announced that Alan Silvestri, who scored Captain America: The First Avenger, would compose the score for The Avengers. Silvestri commented on the challenge of the project, stating, \"I've worked on films where there have been a number of stars and certainly worked on films where there have been characters of equal weight in terms of their level of importance and profile in the film, but this one is somewhat extreme in that regard because each of these characters has their own world and it's a very different situation. It's very challenging to look for a way to give everyone the weight and consideration they need, but at the same time the film is really about the coming together of these characters, which implies that there is this entity called the Avengers which really has to be representative of all of them together.\" Silvestri collaborated with the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London, England to develop the score. Whedon praised Silvestri's approach, stating, \"The score is very old-fashioned, which is why [Silvestri] was letter-perfect for this movie because he can give you the heightened emotion, the [Hans Zimmer] school of 'I'm just feeling a lot right now!' but he can also be extraordinarily cue and character specific, which I love.\"\nIn March 2012, the Indian rock band Agnee released a music video for their single \"Hello Andheron\", serving as the theme song for the Indian release of the film. Hollywood Records released the soundtrack concept album inspired by the film, titled Avengers Assemble, on May 1, 2012, coinciding with the release of the score.\n\nMarketing\nTrailers\nThe film was promoted at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con, featuring a teaser trailer narrated by Samuel L. Jackson followed by an introduction of the cast. In June 2011, Marvel Studios announced that it would not hold a panel at the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con, as studio executives felt unprepared to meet their own past achievements and fan expectations with filming still in production. Subsequently, in July 2011, a teaser trailer intended as the post-credits scene of Captain America: The First Avenger briefly leaked online. Entertainment Weekly speculated that it originated from a preview screening, describing the footage as \"shaky, fuzzy, flickering, and obviously filmed on a cell phone\".\n\nIn August 2011, Walt Disney Pictures, Pixar Animation Studios, and Marvel Studios presented a look at Walt Disney Studios' upcoming film slate, which included The Avengers, at the D23 Expo in Anaheim, California. The presentation featured footage from the film and appearances by the cast members. Later in August, Disney dismissed Marvel's executive vice president of worldwide marketing, vice president of worldwide marketing, and manager of worldwide marketing to bring their functions in-house.\nIn October 2011, Marvel Studios held a presentation at the New York Comic Con featuring new footage and a panel discussion including producer Kevin Feige and several cast members. The first full-length trailer was also released in October. Comic Book Resources noted, \"The two-minute teaser handily establishes the movie's premise\" and is \"heavy on the assembling, but fans are also treated to plenty of action, as well glimpses  [sic] of Iron Man's new armor and, best of all, the new take on the Incredible Hulk. Naturally, Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark gets the best lines\". However, The Hollywood Reporter called it, \"Awesome. Or it would be if we hadn't seen all of this before and expected every single thing that we saw in the trailer\". The trailer, which debuted exclusively on iTunes Movie Trailers, was downloaded over 10 million times in its first 24 hours, breaking the website's record for the most-viewed trailer. This record was surpassed by the trailer for The Dark Knight Rises (2012), which was downloaded more than 12.5 million times in its first 24 hours. A second full-length trailer was released on iTunes in February 2012, reaching a record 13.7 million downloads in 24 hours. The theatrical trailers of The Avengers appeared with many films, including Mission: Impossible \u2013 Ghost Protocol (2011), 21 Jump Street (2012), and The Hunger Games (2012).\nIn January 2012, Marvel Studios hosted a global Twitter chat. The 30-minute live tweeting event featured writer\/director Joss Whedon and cast members Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Hiddleston, and Clark Gregg, along with a 10-second tease of the 30-second commercial that would air during Super Bowl XLVI in February. According to the Los Angeles Times, Disney paid an estimated $4 million for the 30-second spot. On May 1, 2012, executives from Marvel Studios, along with actors Tom Hiddleston and Clark Gregg, rang the opening bell of the New York Stock Exchange in honor of the film's theatrical release.\n\nTie-in comics\nIn December 2011, Marvel announced the release of an eight-issue comic-book prelude to the film, penned by Christopher Yost and Eric Pearson with art by Luke Ross and Daniel HDR, for release in March 2012. In February 2012, Marvel revealed plans for a second limited series comic book tie-in titled Black Widow Strikes, written by Fred Van Lente, who wrote Captain America: First Vengeance, the comic-book prequel to Captain America: The First Avenger. Set between Iron Man 2 and The Avengers, it follows Black Widow as she ties up loose ends from the former film. Additionally, the title Avengers Assemble debuted in March 2012, written by Brian Michael Bendis with art by Mark Bagley, featuring the same Avengers lineup as the film in a battle against a new incarnation of the supervillain team Zodiac.\n\nPromotional partners\nPaul Gitter, president of consumer products at Marvel Entertainment, noted that the anticipation leading up to the film bolstered retail partnerships: \"Retailers have been less tolerant with [intellectual property] films, so we decided that if we started on this coordinated strategy several years ago, retailers would give us shelf space throughout the years and we would have a more sustainable position in the marketplace.\"\nIn September 2011, photos emerged online showing Robert Downey Jr. driving a new model Acura. An Acura spokesperson later confirmed the company's involvement with the film, stating, \"As you may know, Acura has been in the Marvel Comics Universe films as the official car of their fictional law enforcement agency called S.H.I.E.L.D. That relationship continues for The Avengers. The open-top sports car that was photographed yesterday is a one-off, fictional car that was made just for the movie and will not be produced. That said, as you may also know, our CEO has said publicly that we are studying the development of a new sportscar, but we can't say any more about it at this time.\" In December 2011, Acura announced that a new NSX, styled along the lines of the concept built for The Avengers, would be unveiled at the 2012 North American International Auto Show. Additionally, a series of 10 S.H.I.E.L.D. SUVs, based on the Acura MDX with modifications by Cinema Vehicle Services, were also created for the film.\nIn February 2012, Marvel announced a partnership with fragrance company JADS to promote The Avengers with character-based fragrances. The announcement preceded the Toy Industry Association's annual February exhibition, where representatives showcased the products at a sampling booth. Other promotional partners included bracelet-maker Colantotte, Dr Pepper, Farmers Insurance, Harley-Davidson, Hershey, Land O'Frost lunchmeats, Oracle, Red Baron pizza, Symantec, Visa, and Wyndham Hotels & Resorts. Marvel and its parent company Disney secured an estimated $100 million in worldwide marketing support for the film. Notably absent from the promotional lineup were Baskin-Robbins, Burger King, and Dunkin' Donuts, which had partnered with Marvel in the past when their films were distributed by Paramount; Disney generally avoids promotions through fast food outlets.\n\nVideo game\nA video game based on the film was initially planned for simultaneous release. It was intended to be a combination of a first-person shooter and a brawler for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii U, and Microsoft Windows platforms, with THQ as the publisher. The console versions were to be developed by THQ Studio Australia, while Blue Tongue Entertainment was tasked with creating the PC version. However, after THQ shut down both studios, the game was ultimately canceled. Consequently, the intellectual property rights for an Avengers video game reverted to Marvel, which stated that it was exploring potential publishing and licensing opportunities.\nIn May 2012, a collaboration between Ubisoft and Marvel Entertainment was revealed, unveiling their joint project: a motion-controlled game titled Marvel Avengers: Battle for Earth designed for the Wii U and Xbox 360 Kinect. Inspired by the \"Secret Invasion\" storyline, the game showcases 20 different characters. Additionally, Marvel announced the development of a four-chapter mobile game titled Avengers Initiative, with each chapter dedicated to exploring the adventures of Hulk, Captain America, Thor, and Iron Man.\n\nRelease\nTheatrical\nIn February 2012, Disney announced a title change for the film in the United Kingdom to avoid confusion with the British TV series of the same name and its 1998 film adaptation. This caused uncertainty over the film's actual title. Empire magazine reported that the film would be titled Marvel Avengers Assemble, while The Hollywood Reporter said that it would be called simply Avengers Assemble. Marvel's UK website referred to it as Marvel's Avengers Assemble, though David Cox of The Guardian, in arguing that it was one of the worst film titles ever, considered this a production notes error. The British Board of Film Classification and the Irish Film Classification Office listed it as Marvel Avengers Assemble. Frank Lovece in FilmFestivalTraveler.com noted the discrepancy, observing that the film is formally titled \"Marvel's The Avengers\" on screen, despite the absence of an apostrophe on posters. Feige explained the UK title's additional word, emphasizing the thorough decision-making process involved.\nThe film's world premiere took place on April 11, 2012, at Hollywood's El Capitan Theatre. It closed the 11th Annual Tribeca Film Festival with a screening on April 28. For the 2012 U.S. Labor Day weekend, the film received an expanded one-week theatrical push, increasing the number of theaters from 123 to 1,700. The Avengers was the last film released in Phase One of the MCU.\n\nHome media\nThe film was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on Blu-ray Disc, Blu-ray 3D, DVD, and digital download on September 25 in the United States and as early as August 29 in various international markets. Feige mentioned that the Blu-ray version features a new Marvel One-Shot titled Item 47 (2012), along with \"a number of deleted scenes and a few storylines that fell by the wayside during the editing process\". These include \"a few more scenes with the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Maria Hill, played by Cobie Smulders\", and \"some slightly different versions of Maria Hill and Nick Fury's interaction with the World Security Council\".\nThe film was also collected in a 10-disc box set titled \"Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One \u2013 Avengers Assembled\", which includes all of the Phase One films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This box set was released on April 2, 2013. Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment subsequently released the film on Ultra HD Blu-ray on August 14, 2018.\nSome fans have criticized the UK DVD and Blu-ray release for omitting Joss Whedon's audio commentary and altering the scene involving Phil Coulson's death from the film's theatrical version. Disney's UK division stated that the \"less graphic depiction of Agent Coulson's confrontation with Loki\" occurred because \"[e]ach country has its own compliance issues relative to depictions of violence. Unfortunately, another region's elements were inadvertently used to create the UK in-home release\".\nUpon its first week of release on home media in the U.S., the film topped the Nielsen VideoScan First Alert chart, which tracks overall disc sales, as well as the dedicated Blu-ray Disc sales chart. It garnered 72% of unit sales from Blu-ray, setting a record for a new release in which both the DVD and Blu-ray formats were released simultaneously.\nIn July 2024, a Lakota language dub of the film became available on Disney+. Downey, Evans, Hemsworth, Ruffalo, Johansson, and Renner reprised their roles to re-record their lines, with the project spear-headed by Ruffalo. Ruffalo had a previous relationship with the Lakota people and was looking to help further the Lakota's efforts to help revitalize their language.\n\nReception\nBox office\nThe Avengers grossed $623.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $895.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $1.519 billion, making it the third-highest-grossing film of all time, the highest-grossing film of 2012, the highest-grossing comic book adaptation, the highest-grossing superhero film, and the highest-grossing film ever released by Walt Disney Studios, at the time of its release. The film's worldwide opening of $392.5 million ranked as the fourth-largest. The Avengers also became the fifth film distributed by Disney and the twelfth film overall to earn more than $1 billion. It reached this milestone in 19 days, matching the record previously set by Avatar (2009) and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2 (2011). Its grosses exceeded its estimated $220 million production cost 12 days after its release. It was the first Marvel production to generate $1 billion in ticket sales.\n\nUnited States and Canada\nThe film became the third-highest-grossing film of all time, the highest-grossing film of 2012, the highest-grossing film distributed by Disney, the highest-grossing superhero film, and the highest-grossing film based on comics.

The film's Friday gross included an $18.7 million midnight run, a record for a superhero film Without midnight grosses, the film earned the largest opening-day gross ($62.1 million). It also set records for Saturday and Sunday grosses ($69.6 million and $57.1 million, respectively). In total, it earned $207,438,708 for its debut weekend, setting an opening-weekend record, including an IMAX opening-weekend record of $15.3 million and a record for opening-weekend grosses originating from 3D showings ($108 million). The opening-weekend audience was evenly split between those under and over the age of 25, with 60% male, 55% couples, 24% families, and 21% teenagers. Earning $103.1 million on its second weekend, the film set a record for the largest second-weekend gross. Other records set by the film include the biggest weekend per-theater average for a wide release ($47,698 per theater), the fastest film to reach $100 million and each additional $50 million through $550 million, and the largest cumulative gross through every day of release until, and including, its forty-third day (with the exception of its first day). It remained in first place at the box office for three consecutive weekends. The film set a record for the highest monthly share, with its $532.5 million total (through May 31, 2012) accounting for 52% of the total earnings at the box office during May.\n\nRecords\nThe film set the following records upon its theatrical release.\n\nOther territories\nThe film became the third-highest-grossing film of all time, the highest-grossing Disney-distributed film, the highest-grossing film of 2012, and the highest-grossing superhero film.

By Sunday, April 29, it had amassed an opening-weekend total of $185.1 million from 39 countries. It maintained its first-place position at the box office for four consecutive weekends. The film set opening-day records in New Zealand, Malaysia, and Iceland, as well as single-day records in the Philippines. It also achieved both single- and opening-day records in Singapore and Thailand. Additionally, it earned the second-highest-grossing opening day in Australia ($6.2 million), Mexico, the Philippines, and Vietnam.Furthermore, it established opening-weekend records in numerous territories, including Mexico, Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia, Taiwan, the Philippines, Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates, Argentina, Peru, and Central America. It also secured the second-largest five-day opening in Australia ($20.2 million).\nIn the United Kingdom, the film earned \u00a32.5 million ($4.1 million) on its opening day and \u00a315.8 million ($25.7 million) over the weekend, setting a new opening-weekend record for a superhero film. It emerged as the market's highest-grossing superhero film. In Latin America, it set records as the highest-grossing film ($207 million) and the first film to surpass $200 million. It also claimed the top spot as the highest-grossing film in the Philippines, Singapore, and Indonesia. As of February 2021, the film's leading international markets were China ($83 million), United Kingdom ($80.5 million), Brazil ($63.9 million), Mexico ($61.7 million), and Australia ($54.5 million).\n\nCritical response\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 91%, with an average score of 8.1\/10, based on 368 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Thanks to a script that emphasizes its heroes' humanity and a wealth of superpowered set pieces, The Avengers lives up to its hype and raises the bar for Marvel at the movies.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 69 out of 100 based on 43 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade on an \"A+ to F\" scale.\nTodd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave a positive review of the film, remarking, \"It's clamorous, the save-the-world story is one everyone's seen time and again, and the characters have been around for more than half a century in 500 comic book issues. But Whedon and his cohorts have managed to stir all the personalities and ingredients together so that the resulting dish, however familiar, is irresistibly tasty again.\" To Rolling Stone journalist Peter Travers, the film epitomized an exceptional blockbuster. \"It's also the blockbuster,\" Travers said, \"I saw in my head when I imagined a movie that brought together the idols of the Marvel world in one shiny, stupendously exciting package. It's Transformers with a brain, a heart and a working sense of humor.\" Justin Chang of Variety wrote, \"Like a superior, state-of-the-art model built from reconstituted parts, Joss Whedon's buoyant, witty, and robustly entertaining superhero smash-up is escapism of a sophisticated order, boasting a tonal assurance and rich reserves of humor that offset the potentially lumbering and unavoidably formulaic aspects of this 143-minute team-origin story.\" Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times complimented the film's frenetic pace, while Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times commented that it \"provides its fans with exactly what they desire. Whether it is exactly what they deserve is arguable\". Conversely, A. O. Scott of The New York Times believed that \"while The Avengers is hardly worth raging about, its failures are significant and dispiriting. The light, amusing bits cannot overcome the grinding, hectic emptiness, the bloated cynicism that is less a shortcoming of this particular film than a feature of the genre.\"\nThe performances of several cast members were a frequent topic in the critiques. In particular, Mark Ruffalo's portrayal of Dr. Bruce Banner\/the Hulk was well-received by commentators. Joe Neumaier opined that his performance was superior to the rest of the cast; stating, \"Ruffalo is the revelation, turning Banner into a wry reservoir of calm ready to become a volcano.\" Similarly, The New Yorker's Anthony Lane proclaimed Ruffalo's acting to be one of the film's highlights\u2014alongside Downey. The Village Voice's Karina Longworth concluded: \"Ruffalo successfully refreshes the Hulk myth, playing Banner as an adorably bashful nerd-genius who, in contrast to the preening hunks on the team, knows better than to draw attention to himself.\" Travers asserted that the actor resonated a \"scruffy warmth and humor\" vibe, while Turan felt that he surpassed predecessors Edward Norton and Eric Bana in playing the character. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that \"the smartest thing the filmmakers did was to get Mark Ruffalo to play Bruce Banner as a man so sensitive that he's at war, every moment, with himself. (The film finally solves the Hulk problem: He's a lot more fun in small doses.)\"\nReferring to Downey, Joe Morgenstein of The Wall Street Journal\u2014despite complimenting Downey's performance\u2014favored his work in Iron Man over his acting in The Avengers: \"His Iron Man is certainly a team player, but Mr. Downey comes to the party with two insuperable superpowers: a character of established sophistication\u2014the industrialist\/inventor Tony Stark, a sharp-tongued man of the world\u2014and his own quicksilver presence that finds its finest expression in self-irony.\" Neumaier praised Evans, stating that he accurately conveyed his character's internal conflicts.\nCommentators appreciated the character development and dialogue. Associated Press reviewer Christy Lemire wrote that the script \"sparkles as brightly as the special effects; these people may be wearing ridiculous costumes but they're well fleshed-out underneath.\" Scott suggested that certain parts of the film exuded a charm reminiscent of the western film Rio Bravo (1959). Longworth felt that while Whedon's script delved into the backstory of the characters, the film did not explore it \"in a substantive way\".\n\nAccolades\nAt the 85th Academy Awards, The Avengers received a nomination for Best Visual Effects. The film's other nominations include two Annie Awards (winning one), a British Academy Film Award, and three Critics' Choice Movie Awards. In 2017, it was featured as one of the 100 greatest films of all time in Empire magazine's poll of The 100 Greatest Movies.\n\nSequels\nAvengers: Age of Ultron was written and directed by Whedon, and released on May 1, 2015. The film features much of the original cast, alongside new additions including Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch, Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Quicksilver, Paul Bettany as Vision, and James Spader as Ultron. Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame were directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, with a script by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. Infinity War was released on April 27, 2018, followed by Endgame on April 26, 2019. The ensemble cast for both films includes returning actors from previous MCU entries, as well as new characters from other films in the franchise.\n\nSee also\n\"What If... the World Lost Its Mightiest Heroes?\", an episode of the MCU television series What If...? that reimagines some events of this film\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nThe Avengers at IMDb\nThe Avengers at AllMovie\nMarvel's The Avengers at Disney A to Z \nThe Battle of New York: An Avengers Oral History at Thrillist","99":"The Avengers is a British espionage television series, created in 1961, that ran for 161 episodes until 1969. It initially focused on David Keel (Ian Hendry), aided by John Steed (Patrick Macnee). Ian Hendry left after the first series; Steed then became the main character, partnered with a succession of assistants. His most famous assistants were intelligent, stylish, and assertive women: Cathy Gale (Honor Blackman), Emma Peel (Diana Rigg), and Tara King (Linda Thorson). Dresses and suits for the series were made by Pierre Cardin.\nThe series screened as one-hour episodes for its entire run. The first episode, \"Hot Snow\", aired on 7 January 1961. The final episode, \"Bizarre\", aired on 21 April 1969 in the United States, and on 17 May 1969 in the United Kingdom.\nThe Avengers was produced by ABC Weekend TV, a contractor within the ITV network. After a merger with Rediffusion London in July 1968, ABC Weekend became Thames Television, which continued production of the series, subcontracted to ABC Television Films. By 1969, The Avengers was shown in more than 90 countries. ITV produced a sequel series, The New Avengers (1976\u20131977), with Patrick Macnee returning as John Steed, and two new partners. In 2004 and 2007, The Avengers was ranked No. 17 and No. 20 on TV Guide's Top Cult Shows Ever.\n\nPremise\nThe Avengers was marked by different eras as co-stars came and went. The only constant was John Steed, played by Patrick Macnee.\n\nSeries 1 (1961)\nABC Weekend TV produced a single series of Police Surgeon, in which Ian Hendry played police surgeon Geoffrey Brent, from September through December 1960. While Police Surgeon did not last long, viewers praised Ian Hendry, and ABC Television cast him in its new series The Avengers, which replaced Police Surgeon in January 1961.\nThe Avengers began with the episode \"Hot Snow\", in which medical doctor David H. Keel (Hendry) investigates the murder of his fianc\u00e9e, office receptionist Peggy, by a drug ring. A stranger named John Steed who was also investigating the ring appears, and together Dr. Keel and Steed set out to avenge Peggy's death in the first two episodes. Steed asks Dr. Keel to partner with him, as needed, to solve crimes. Ian Hendry was considered the star of the new series, receiving top billing over Patrick Macnee, and Steed did not appear in two of the series' episodes.\nAs the first series of The Avengers progressed, Steed's importance increased, and he carried the final episode solo. While Steed and Dr. Keel used wit while discussing crimes and dangers, the series also depicted the interplay\u2014and often tension\u2014between Dr. Keel's idealism and Steed's professionalism. As seen in one of the three surviving episodes from the first series, \"The Frighteners\", Steed also had informants among the general population to aid his investigations, similar to the \"Baker Street Irregulars\" of Sherlock Holmes.\nThe other regular in the first series was Carol Wilson (Ingrid Hafner), the nurse and receptionist who replaced the slain Peggy. Carol assisted Dr. Keel and Steed in cases, and in at least one episode (\"Girl on the Trapeze\") was very much in the thick of the action, but without being part of Steed's inner circle. Ingrid Hafner had played opposite Ian Hendry as a nurse in one episode of Police Surgeon. The role of Carol Wilson was initially offered to Jan Watson, who turned it down for another film.\nThe series was shot on 405-line videotape using a multicamera setup. There was little provision for editing and virtually no location footage was shot (although the first shot of the first episode consisted of location footage). As was standard practice at the time, videotapes of early episodes of The Avengers were reused. At present, only three complete Series 1 episodes are known to exist and are held in archives as 16-mm film telerecordings: \"Girl on the Trapeze\" (which does not feature Steed), \"The Frighteners\" and \"Tunnel of Fear\". Additionally, the first 15 minutes of the first episode, \"Hot Snow\", also exist as a telerecording; the extant footage ends at the conclusion of the first act, prior to the introduction of John Steed.\nThe missing television episodes were recreated for audio by Big Finish Productions under the title of The Avengers \u2013 The Lost Episodes and star Julian Wadham as Steed, Anthony Howell as Dr Keel and Lucy Briggs-Owen as Carol Wilson.\n\nSeries 2\u20133 (1962\u20131964)\nProduction of the first series was cut short by a strike. By the time production could begin on the second series, Ian Hendry had quit to pursue a film career. Patrick Macnee was promoted to star, and Steed became the focus of the series, initially working with a rotation of three different partners. Dr Martin King (Jon Rollason), a thinly disguised recreation of the Dr. Keel character, saw action in only three episodes, which were produced from scripts written for the first series. Dr. King was intended to be a transitional character between Dr. Keel and Steed's two new female partners, but while the Dr. King episodes were shot first, they were shown out of production order in the middle of the season. The character was thereafter quickly and quietly dropped.\nNightclub singer Venus Smith (Julie Stevens) appeared in six episodes. She was a complete \"amateur\", meaning that she did not have any professional crime-fighting skills as did the two doctors. She was excited to be participating in a spy adventure alongside secret agent Steed (although some episodes\u2014\"The Removal Men\", \"The Decapod\"\u2014indicate she is not always enthusiastic). Nonetheless, she appears to be attracted to him, and their relationship is somewhat similar to that later portrayed between Steed and Tara King. Her episodes featured live musical portions showcasing her singing performances. The character of Venus underwent some revision during her run, adopting more youthful demeanour and dress.\nThe first episode broadcast in the second series introduced the partner who would change the show into the format for which it is most remembered. Honor Blackman played Mrs. Cathy Gale, a self-assured, quick-witted anthropologist who was skilled in judo and had a passion for leather clothes. Widowed during the Mau Mau rebellion years in Kenya, she was the \"talented amateur\" who provided her aid to Steed's cases as a service to her nation. She was said to have been born on 5 October 1930 at midnight, and was reared in Africa. Mrs. Catherine Gale was in her early-to-mid 30s during her tenure, in contrast to female characters in similar series who tended to be younger.\nCatherine Gale was unlike any female character seen before on British TV, and she became a household name. Reportedly, part of her charm was because her earliest appearances were episodes in which dialogue written for Keel was simply transferred to her. Series scriptwriter Dennis Spooner described about this detail: \"There's the famous story of how Honor Blackman played Ian Hendry's part, which is why they stuck her in leather and such\u2014it was so much cheaper than changing the lines!\" In \"Conspiracy of Silence\", she holds her own in a vociferous tactical disagreement with her partner.\nVenus Smith did not return for the third series, and Cathy Gale became Steed's only regular partner. The series established a level of sexual tension between Steed and Cathy Gale, but the writers were not allowed to go beyond flirting and innuendo. Despite this, the relationship between Steed and Catherine Gale was progressive for 1962\u201363. In \"The Golden Eggs,\" it is revealed that Cathy Gale lived in Steed's flat; according to Steed, her rent was to keep the refrigerator well-stocked and to cook for him (she appears to do neither). However, this was said to be a temporary arrangement while Catherine Gale looked for a new home, and Steed was sleeping at a hotel.\nDuring the first series, there were hints that Steed worked for a branch of British Intelligence, and this was expanded in the second series. Steed initially received orders from different superiors, including someone referred to as \"Charles\", and \"One-Ten\" (Douglas Muir). By the third series, the delivery of Steed's orders was not depicted on screen or explained. The secret organisation to which Steed belongs is shown in \"The Nutshell\", and it is Cathy Gale's first visit to their headquarters.\nSmall references to Steed's background were occasionally made. In the Series 3 episode \"Death of a Batman,\" it was said that Steed was with I Corps in the Second World War, and in Munich in 1945. In the Series 4 episode \"The Hour That Never Was,\" Steed attends a reunion of his RAF squadron. Since the ties he wears are either cavalry or old school, it is apparent that he has attended a number of leading public schools.\nA theatrical film version of the series was in its initial planning stages by late 1963, after Series 3 was completed. An early story proposal paired Steed and Catherine Gale with a male and female duo of American agents, to make the movie appeal to the American market. Before the project could gain momentum, Honor Blackman was cast opposite Sean Connery in Goldfinger, requiring her to leave the series.\n\nSeries transformation\nDuring the Gale era, Steed was transformed from a rugged trenchcoat-wearing agent into the stereotypical English gentleman, complete with Savile Row suit, bowler hat and umbrella, with clothes later designed by Pierre Cardin. (Steed had first donned bowler and carried his distinctive umbrella during the first series, as \"The Frighteners\" depicts.) The bowler and umbrella were soon revealed to be full of tricks, including a sword hidden within the umbrella handle and a steel plate concealed in the hat. These items were referred to in the French, German and Polish titles of the series, Chapeau melon et bottes de cuir (\"Bowler hat and leather boots\"), Mit Schirm, Charme und Melone (\"With Umbrella, Charm and Bowler Hat\") and Rewolwer i melonik (\"A Revolver and a Bowler Hat\"), respectively. With his impeccable manners, old-world sophistication and vintage car, Steed came to represent the traditional Englishman of an earlier era.\nBy contrast, Steed's partners were youthful, forward-looking and always attired in the latest mod fashions. Catherine Gale's innovative leather outfits suited her many athletic fight scenes. Honor Blackman became a star in Britain with her black leather outfits and boots (nicknamed \"kinky boots\") and her judo-based fighting style. Patrick Macnee and Honor Blackman even released a novelty song called \"Kinky Boots\". Honor Blackman also carried a pistol in \"Killer Whale\". Some of the clothes seen in The Avengers were designed at the studio of John Sutcliffe, who published the AtomAge fetish magazine.\nSeries scriptwriter Dennis Spooner said that the series would frequently feature Steed visiting busy public places such as the main airport in London without anyone else present in the scene: \"'Can't you afford extras?' they'd ask. Well, it wasn't like that. It's just that Steed had to be alone to be accepted. Put him in a crowd and he sticks out like a sore thumb! Let's face it, with normal people he's weird. The trick to making him acceptable is never to show him in a normal world, just fighting villains who are odder than he is!\"\n\nSeries 4\u20135 (1965\u20131967)\nThe show was sold to the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in 1965, and The Avengers became one of the first British series to be aired on prime-time US television. The US ABC network paid the then-unheard-of sum of $2 million for the first 26 episodes. The average budget for each episode was reportedly \u00a356,000, which was high for the British industry. The fourth series aired in the US from March to the beginning of September 1966. Each episode still finished with the logo of ABC Weekend TV.\nThe US deal meant that the producers could afford to start shooting the series on 35mm film, with production transferring from ABC's television studios in Teddington to the Associated British film studios in Elstree. The use of film, rather than the videotape of the earlier episodes, was essential, because British 405-line video was technically incompatible with the US NTSC videotape format. Filmed productions were standard on US prime-time television at the time. The Avengers continued to be produced in black-and-white.\nThe transfer to film meant that episodes would be shot using the single-camera setup, giving the production greater flexibility. The use of film production and the single-camera production style allowed more sophisticated visuals and camera angles, and more outdoor location shots, all of which greatly improved the look of the series. As was standard on British television filmed production through the 1960s, all location work on Series 4 was shot mute, with the soundtrack created in post-production. Dialogue scenes were filmed in the studio, leading to some jumps between location and studio footage.\n\nNew female partner Mrs. Emma Peel (Diana Rigg) debuted in October 1965. The name of the character derived from a comment by writers, during development, that they wanted a character with \"man appeal\". In an early attempt to incorporate this concept into the character's name, she was called \"Samantha Peel\", shortened to the awkward \"Mantha Peel\". Eventually, the writers began referring to the idea by the verbal shorthand \"M. Appeal\", which gave rise to the character's ultimate name.\nAfter more than 60 actresses had been auditioned, the first choice to play the role was Elizabeth Shepherd. However, after filming one and a half episodes (the pilot, \"The Town of No Return\", and part of \"The Murder Market\"), Elizabeth Shepherd was released. Her on-screen personality was deemed less interesting than that of Honor Blackman's Catherine Gale, and it was decided that she was not right for the role. Another 20 actresses were auditioned before the show's casting director, Dodo Watts, suggested that producers Brian Clemens and Albert Fennell check out a televised drama featuring the relatively unknown Diana Rigg. (She had earlier guested in an episode of The Sentimental Agent that Brian Clemens had written.) Diana Rigg's screen test with Patrick Macnee showed that the two immediately worked well together.\nA prologue was added to the beginning of all the fourth-series episodes for the American broadcasts. This was to clarify some initial confusion audiences had regarding the characters and their mission. In the opener, a waiter holding a champagne bottle falls dead onto a human-sized chessboard, a dagger protruding from a target on his back. Steed and Mrs. Emma Peel (dressed in her trademark leather catsuit) walk up to the body as the voice-over explains: \"Extraordinary crimes against the people, and the state, have to be avenged by agents extraordinary. Two such people are John Steed, top professional, and his partner Emma Peel, talented amateur. Otherwise known as The Avengers\". During this voice-over, Steed pours two drinks from the wine bottle and Mrs. Peel replaces her gun in her boot. They clink glasses and depart together as the screen fades to black and the opening titles begin.\n\nIn contrast to the Gale episodes, there is a lighter, comic touch in Steed's and Mrs. Emma Peel's interactions with each other and their reactions to other characters and situations. Earlier series had a harder tone, with the Gale era including some quite serious espionage dramas. This almost completely disappeared as Steed and Mrs. Emma Peel visibly enjoy topping each other's witticisms. The layer of conflict with Catherine Gale\u2014who on occasion openly resented being used by Steed, often without her permission\u2014is absent from Steed's interaction with Emma Peel. Also, the sexual tension between Steed and Catherine Gale is quite different from the tension between Steed and Emma Peel. In both cases, the exact relationship between the partners is left ambiguous, although they seemed to have carte blanche to visit each other's homes whenever they please, and it is not uncommon for scenes to suggest that Steed had spent the night at Catherine Gale's or Emma Peel's home, or vice versa. Although nothing \"improper\" is displayed, the close chemistry between Steed and Mrs. Emma Peel constantly suggests intimacy between the two.\nScience fiction and fantasy elements (a style later known as Spy-Fi) also began to emerge in storylines. The duo encounters killer robots (\"The Cybernauts\"), telepaths (\"Too Many Christmas Trees\") and giant alien carnivorous plants (\"The Man-Eater of Surrey Green\").\nIn her fourth episode, \"Death at Bargain Prices,\" Mrs. Emma Peel takes an undercover job at a department store. Her uniform for promoting space-age toys is an elaborate leather catsuit plus silver boots, sash and welder's gloves. The suit (minus the silver accessories) became her signature outfit, which she wore primarily for fight scenes in early episodes and in the titles. Some episodes contain a fetishistic undercurrent. In \"A Touch of Brimstone\", Mrs. Peel dresses in a dominatrix outfit of corset, laced boots and spiked collar to become the \"Queen of Sin\".\n\nEmma Peel's avant-garde fashions, featuring bold accents and high-contrast geometric patterns, emphasise her youthful, contemporary personality. For the 1965 season, some of her most memorable outfits were designed by John Bates, including graphic black-and-white Op art mini-coats and accessories, and a silver ensemble comprising a bra bodice, low-slung trousers and jacket. She represents the modern England of the Sixties \u2013 just as Steed, with his vintage style and mannerisms, personifies Edwardian-era nostalgia. According to Patrick Macnee in his book The Avengers and Me, Diana Rigg disliked wearing leather and insisted on a new line of fabric athletic wear for the fifth series. Alun Hughes, who had designed clothing for Diana Rigg's personal wardrobe, was suggested by the actress to design Emma Peel's \"softer\" new wardrobe. Pierre Cardin was brought in to design a new wardrobe for Macnee. In the US, TV Guide ran a four-page photo spread on Diana Rigg's new \"Emmapeeler\" outfits (10\u201316 June 1967). Eight tight-fitting jumpsuits were created, in a variety of bright colours and made of the stretch fabric crimplene.\n\nMove to colour\nAfter one filmed series (of 26 episodes) in black and white, The Avengers began filming in colour for the fifth series in 1966. It was three years before Britain's ITV network began full colour broadcasting. The first 16 episodes of this series were broadcast concurrently in the US, in colour, and the UK, in black and white, from January to May 1967. Eight further episodes were broadcast in the UK beginning in late September, while these episodes were withheld in the US until early 1968, where they would be immediately succeeded by the first batch of episodes featuring Diana Rigg's replacement, Linda Thorson. The American prologue of the fourth series was modified for the colour episodes. The show opened with the caption The Avengers in Color (required by the US ABC for colour series at that time), followed by Steed unwrapping the foil from a champagne bottle and Emma Peel shooting the cork away. Unlike the \"chessboard\" opening of the previous series, this new prologue had no narrative voice-over, and the scene was also included in UK broadcasts of the series. At the end of the closing credits, all previous series had ended with the ABC Weekend TV logo, but the fifth and sixth series \u2014 now made by ABC's sister company A.B.C. Television Films \u2014 instead featured an animation where the letters \"ABC\" were revealed to stand for \"Associated British Corporation\", a name apparently invented for ABC shows exported to the US to avoid confusion with the US ABC network. (The legal name of ABC Weekend TV was originally \"Associated British Cinemas (Television) Ltd\", later shortened to \"A.B.C. Television Ltd\".)\nThe first 16 episodes of the fifth series begin with Emma Peel receiving a call-to-duty message from Steed: \"Mrs. Peel, we're needed\". Emma Peel would be conducting her normal activities when she unexpectedly received a message on a calling card or within a delivered gift, at which point Steed suddenly appeared (usually in her apartment). \nThe series also introduced a comic tagline caption to the episode title, using the format of \"Steed [does this], Emma [does that]\". For example, \"The Joker\" had the opening caption: \"Steed trumps an ace, Emma plays a lone hand\". \"The Joker\" was to a large extent a rewrite of \"Don't Look Behind You\", a black-and-white Cathy Gale episode. Three other colour Emma Peel episodes were rewrites of Cathy Gale episodes.\nThe \"Mrs Peel, we're needed\" scenes and the alternate taglines were dropped after the first 16 episodes, after a break in production, for financial reasons. They were deemed by the UK networks as disposable if The Avengers was to return to ITV screens (Dave Rogers' book The Avengers Anew lists a set for every Steed\/Emma Peel episode except \"The Forget-Me-Knot\").\nStories were increasingly characterised by a futuristic, science-fiction bent, with mad scientists and their creations wreaking havoc. The duo dealt with being shrunk to doll size (\"Mission... Highly Improbable\"), pet cats being electrically altered to become ferocious and lethal \"miniature tigers\" (\"The Hidden Tiger\"), killer automata (\"Return of The Cybernauts\"), mind-transferring machines (\"Who's Who???\") and invisible foes (\"The See-Through Man\").\nThe series parodied its American contemporaries with episodes such as \"The Girl From AUNTIE\", \"Mission... Highly Improbable\" and \"The Winged Avenger\" (spoofing The Man from U.N.C.L.E., Mission: Impossible and Batman, respectively). The show still carried the basic format: Steed and his associate were charged with solving the problem in the space of a 50-minute episode, thus preserving the safety of 1960s Britain.\nHumour was evident in the names and acronyms of the organisations. For example, in \"The Living Dead,\" two rival groups examine reported ghost sightings: FOG (Friends of Ghosts) and SMOG (Scientific Measurement of Ghosts). \"The Hidden Tiger\" features the Philanthropic Union for Rescue, Relief and Recuperation of Cats\u2014PURRR\u2014led by characters named Cheshire, Manx and Angora.\nThe series also occasionally adopted a metafictional tone, coming close to breaking the fourth wall. In the Series 5 episode \"Something Nasty in the Nursery\", Emma Peel directly refers to the series' storytelling convention of having potentially helpful sources of information killed off just before she or Steed arrive. This then occurs a few minutes later. In the tag scene for the same episode, Steed and Emma Peel tell viewers\u2014indirectly\u2014to tune in next week.\nDiana Rigg's stunt double was stuntwoman Cyd Child, though stuntman Peter Elliot doubled for Diana Rigg in a stunt dive in \"The Bird Who Knew Too Much\".\n\nDiana Rigg's departure\nDiana Rigg was initially unhappy with the way she was treated by the show's producers. During her first series, she learned that she was being paid less than the cameraman. She demanded a raise to put her more on a par with her co-star, or she would leave the show. The producers gave in, thanks to the show's great popularity in the US. At the end of the fifth series in 1967, Diana Rigg left to pursue other projects. This included following Honor Blackman to play a leading role in a James Bond film, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, as James Bond's wife Tracy Bond.\nPatrick Macnee and Diana Rigg remained lifelong friends.\nOn 25 October 2015, to mark 50 years of Emma Peel, the BFI (British Film Institute) screened an episode of The Avengers followed by an onstage interview with Diana Rigg, during which she discussed her reasons for leaving the show and Patrick Macnee's reaction to her departure.\n\nSeries 6 (1968\u20131969)\nWhen Diana Rigg left the series in October 1967, the British network executives decided that the current series formula, despite resulting in popular success, could not be pursued further. Thus, they decided that a \"return to realism\" was appropriate for the sixth series (1968\u201369). Brian Clemens and Albert Fennell were replaced by John Bryce, producer of most of the Cathy Gale-era episodes.\nJohn Bryce had a difficult situation to handle. He had to find a replacement for Diana Rigg and shoot the first seven episodes of the new series, which were supposed to be shipped to the US together with the last eight Emma Peel colour episodes. Bryce signed his then-girlfriend, 20-year-old newcomer Linda Thorson, as the new female co-star and chose the name Tara King for her character. Linda Thorson played the role with more innocence in mind and at heart, and unlike the previous partnerships with Cathy Gale and Emma Peel, the writers allowed subtle hints of romance to blossom between Steed and Tara King. Tara King also differed from Steed's previous partners in that she was a fully fledged (albeit initially inexperienced) agent working for Steed's organisation; his previous partners had all been (in the words of the prologue used for American broadcasts of the first Rigg series) talented amateurs. Bryce wanted Tara to be blonde, so Linda Thorson's brown hair was bleached. However, the process badly damaged Linda Thorson's hair, so she had to wear wigs for the first third of her episodes, until her own hair grew back. Her natural brown hair was not seen until the episode, \"All Done with Mirrors.\"\nProduction of the first seven episodes of the sixth series began, but the financial problems and internal difficulties undermined John Bryce's effort. He only managed to complete three episodes: \"Invitation to a Killing\" (a 90-minute episode introducing Tara King), \"The Great, Great Britain Crime\" (some of its original footage was reused in the 1969 episode \"Homicide and Old Lace\"), and \"Invasion of the Earthmen\" (which survived relatively intact except for the scenes in which Tara wears a brown wig).\nAfter a rough cut screening of these episodes to studio executives, John Bryce was fired and Brian Clemens and Albert Fennell were summoned back. At their return, a fourth episode called \"The Murderous Connection\" was in its second day of production. After revising the script, it was renamed as \"The Curious Case of the Countless Clues\" and production resumed. Production of the episode \"Split!\", a leftover script from the Emma Peel colour series, proceeded. Two completely new episodes were also shot: \"Get-A-Way\", and \"Look (Stop Me If You've Heard This One) But There Were These Two Fellers\".\n\nDennis Spooner said of the event:Brian left The Avengers for about three episodes, someone took over, and when Brian came back, it was in a terrible state. He was faced with doing a rewrite on a film they'd already shot. The episode had a story error where Steed leaves for a destination. The villains then realise this and pursue him \u2013 yet arrive there before Steed does. It was fixed by having a character ask Steed 'What took you so long?', to which he replies 'I came the pretty way'. \"You can only do that on The Avengers you see. It was just my favourite show to work on.\nBrian Clemens and Albert Fennell decided to film a new episode to introduce Tara King. This, the third episode filmed for the sixth series, was titled \"The Forget-Me-Knot\" and bade farewell to Emma Peel and introduced her successor, a trained but inexperienced agent named Tara King. It would be broadcast as the first episode of the sixth series. Tara debuts in dynamic style: when Steed is called to Headquarters, he is attacked and knocked down by trainee agent Tara King, who mistakes him for her training partner.\nNo farewell scenes for Emma Peel had been shot when Diana Rigg left the series. She was recalled for \"The Forget-Me-Knot\", through which Emma acts as Steed's partner as usual. Diana Rigg also filmed a farewell scene for Emma that appeared as the tag scene of the episode. It was explained that Emma's husband, Peter Peel, was found alive and rescued, and she left the British secret service to be with him. Emma visits Steed to say goodbye, and while leaving she passes Tara on the stairway giving the advice that \"he likes his tea stirred anti-clockwise\". Steed looks out of the window as a departing Emma enters the Bentley driven by Peter, who from a distance seems to resemble Steed (and was played by Steed's regular stunt double, with bowler hat and umbrella).\nJohn Bryce's original episode introducing Tara, \"Invitation to a Killing\", was revised as a regular 60-minute episode named \"Have Guns Will Haggle\". These episodes, together with \"Invasion of the Earthmen\" and the last eight Emma Peel colour episodes, were shipped to the US in February 1968.\nFor this series the government official who gave Steed his orders was depicted on screen. Mother, introduced in \"The Forget-Me-Knot,\" is a man in a wheelchair. The role was taken by Patrick Newell, who had played different roles in two earlier episodes, most recently in Series 5. Mother's headquarters would shift from place to place, including one episode in which his complete office was on the top level of a double-decker bus. Several James Bond films of the 1970s would make use of a similar gimmick for Bond's briefings.\nAdded later as a regular was Mother's mute Amazonian assistant, Rhonda, played by uncredited actress Rhonda Parker. There was one appearance by an agency official code-named \"Father\", a blind older woman played by Iris Russell. (Iris Russell had appeared in the series several times previously in other roles.) In one episode, \"Killer\", Steed is paired with Lady Diana Forbes Blakeney (Jennifer Croxton) while King is on holiday.\nScriptwriter Dennis Spooner later reflected: \"When I wrote 'Look (Stop Me If You've Heard This One) But There Were These Two Fellers', that was definitely the last series. They were going to make no more, so in that series we went right over the top; we went really weird, because they knew there weren't going to be any more\".\nDennis Spooner said the series \"worked because it became a parody on itself, almost. You can only do that so long.\" He attributes the overall success of the show to its light approach: \"We spoofed everything; we took Mission: Impossible, Bad Day at Black Rock, High Noon, The Dirty Dozen, The Birds... we took them all. The film buffs used to love it. There were always lines in it that people knew what we were talking about\".\nThe revised series continued to be broadcast in the US. The episodes with Linda Thorson as Tara King proved to be highly rated in Europe and the UK. However, in the US, the ABC network chose to air it opposite the number-one show in the country at the time, Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In. Steed and Tara King could not compete, and the show was cancelled in the US. Without this vital commercial backing, production could not continue in Britain either, and the series ended in May 1969. The final scene of the final episode (\"Bizarre\") has Steed and Tara King, champagne glasses in hand, accidentally launching themselves into orbit aboard a rocket, as Mother breaks the fourth wall and says to the audience \"They'll be back!\", before adding in shock \"They're unchaperoned up there!\"\n\nCast\nPatrick Macnee as John Steed (Series 1\u20136)\nIan Hendry as Dr David Keel (Series 1)\nHonor Blackman as Cathy Gale (Series 2\u20133)\nJon Rollason as Dr Martin King (Series 2)\nJulie Stevens as Venus Smith (Series 2)\nDiana Rigg as Emma Peel (Series 4\u20135)\nLinda Thorson as Tara King (Series 6)\n\nProduction\nMusic\nThe 1961 series featured a jazz-influenced theme by John Dankworth. Library music was used sparsely as a soundtrack, sometimes with variations based on the main theme. Dankworth's theme music was reworked for the third series. John Dankworth's first theme was recorded on the Columbia label, on a 45rpm single, and a new recording, similar to the reworked television theme was issued on Fontana in 1963. A very faithful cover version was released by Johnny Gregory.\nWhen Diana Rigg joined the series in 1965, the opening credits of the series were redesigned and new theme music by Laurie Johnson was introduced. This was based on a previously released title on LP, called \"The Shake\" (which capitalised on \"The Shake\" dance craze of the '60s). For the colour series (1967), a percussion section was added to accompany the new teaser sequence at the start of each episode. Laurie Johnson re-scored the theme when Linda Thorson joined the series, adding a counter-melody on trumpet, based on the leitmotif for Tara King from the final Diana Rigg episode \"The Forget-Me-Knot.\" The new theme debuted in the closing titles of the episode \"The Forget-Me-Knot,\" which introduced Linda Thorson. It was altogether more dynamic, and included a much more frenetic percussion section, for the revised teaser sequence. Importantly, the filmed episodes contained specially composed scores by Johnson. To accompany Steed's request, \"Mrs. Peel \u2013 we're needed!\", he composed a brief 'sting', and there was also a special theme for 'Emma'. For the 'Linda Thorson' series, a characteristic piece was composed to accompany the tag scene, at the end of each episode. Many of the most memorable cues from the Rigg\/Thorson series, including the opening, and closing titles themes, and the 'Tag Scene' were released commercially on CD in 2009.\nOwing to a professional commitment to score for the film Hot Millions (starring Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith), Laurie Johnson requested assistance from his keyboard player, Howard Blake, who scored some of the episodes of the final season, as well as additional music for other episodes which Laurie Johnson did not have time to complete. These were composed in a style remarkably similar to Laurie Johnson's. In 2011, to mark the 50th anniversary of the series, these almost-complete scores by Howard Blake\u2212including Laurie Johnson's themes for the main and end titles\u2014were issued on a double-CD set. Of the original Johnson theme, countless cover versions have been released on vinyl and CD, and the opening motif was retained on the series The New Avengers.\nLaurie Johnson subsequently collaborated with Brian Clemens on other projects, including the theme for The New Avengers.\n\nCars\nThe cars used in the series became almost as famous as the actors. From the 4th series on, Steed's signature cars were six vintage, green 1926\u20131928 Bentley racing or town cars, including Blower Bentleys and Bentley Speed Sixes (although, uniquely, in \"The Thirteenth Hole\" he drives a Vauxhall 30-98). In the final series, he drove two yellow Rolls-Royces \u2013 a 1923 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost and a 1927 Rolls-Royce New Phantom. Peel drove Lotus Elan convertibles (a white 1964 and a powder blue 1966), which, like her clothes, emphasised her independence and vitality. During the first Peel series (Series 4), each episode ended with a short, humorous scene of the duo leaving the scene of their most recent adventure in some unusual vehicle.  Mother occasionally appeared in a silver Rolls-Royce. Tara King drove an AC 428 and a Lotus Europa. Lady Diana Forbes Blakeney drove an MGC Roadster.\n\nProduction team\nSydney Newman, who would later go on to spearhead the creation of Doctor Who for the BBC, never received screen credit as the creator of The Avengers. In his memoir, The Avengers and Me, Patrick Macnee interviewed Newman about this. Newman explained that he never sought on-screen credit on the series because during his previous tenure at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, such credits were not given, and he never thought to get one for The Avengers.\nThe production team changed during the series' long run, particularly between the third and fourth series, but the influence of Brian Clemens was felt throughout. He wrote the second episode and became the series' most prolific scriptwriter. Succeeding producers Leonard White and John Bryce, Julian Wintle became the producer of the 4th series with Brian Clemens credited as associate producer and Albert Fennell credited as \"In charge of production\". For series 5, made by A.B.C. Television Films (which was created during the run-up to ABC Weekend TV and Associated-Rediffusion forming Thames TV) Clemens and Fennell became co-producers, with Wintle as executive producer. For series 6, after its initial producer John Bryce left, Clemens and Fennell returned as co-producers; early episodes also credit Julian Wintle as consultant to the series and Philip Levene as story consultant.\nRay Austin became the fight arranger for series 4 and 5, introducing kung fu to the series. Ray Austin had been training with Chee Soo and they worked techniques from Feng Shou kung fu and tai chi into the fight scenes and credit sequences. Ray Austin, Diana Rigg and Chee Soo were later awarded a Guinness world record as the first people to show kung fu on television. Later he became a prolific television director. Joe Dunne took over for series 6.\n\nEpisodes\nSix series of The Avengers were made between 1961 and 1969. There was an enforced break in filming and transmission towards the end of series five due to financial problems. Television researcher Andrew Pixley and authors Paul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping in their book The Avengers Dossier: The Unauthorised and Unofficial Guide consider the last eight episodes produced after the break as constituting a short series six, and therefore count seven series in total. Within the internal production of The Avengers the last eight episodes were considered to be a continuation of series five.\n\nReception\nIn Canada and the United States\nAlthough telerecordings of the second and third series were seen in Canada as early as 1963, the first two series of The Avengers were not broadcast on television in the United States. The American ABC purchased the rights to broadcast seasons 4 and 5 in the United States in 1965. The sale of The Avengers to United States television prompted a change in production style from the 405-line British multi-camera stand to the single-camera shooting method, originated on 35mm film.\nThe series' stunt man and stunt arranger Ray Austin expressed the opinion that the show's violence ultimately harmed its popular success in the United States. There The Avengers was given a late timeslot due to its violence: \"They did that with the first Avengers here [in the U.S.], with Diana Rigg. They put us on at 11:30 pm on CBS  [sic], because it was too violent\". Austin goes on to explain that US television follows a \"different code\". Austin said that on The Avengers \"we were determined to do the show our way, the English way, and no one was going to stop us! And, indeed, no one did stop us. We never, never got to prime time. And it was our own faults, because we would not comply to the Midwest. That's where the money comes from in this country, nowhere else. Forget Los Angeles, forget New York\u2014you have to aim for the Midwest. If the Midwest watches your show, you've made it\". In fact the first and second series of Emma Peel episodes mainly aired at 10:00 pm on ABC. The final Rigg episodes and all the Linda Thorson episodes mainly ran at 7:30 pm, also on ABC.\nAmerican censors objected to some content, in particular the episode \"A Touch of Brimstone\", which featured a modern-day version of the Hellfire Club and climaxed with Emma being dressed in a skimpy corset costume with spiked collar and high-heeled boots to become the Queen of Sin, and being attacked with a whip by guest star Peter Wyngarde. The American broadcast network refused to air it. In total five episodes from the first Emma Peel series were not initially broadcast by ABC. These were: \"A Surfeit of H2O\", \"Silent Dust\" (which featured Emma being attacked with a horsewhip), \"Quick-Quick Slow Death\", \"A Touch of Brimstone\" and \"Honey for the Prince\" (in which Emma performed the dance of the seven veils), although they were seen in later syndicated repeats.\nEarlier Cathy Gale and Venus Smith episodes had aired in Canada before the arrival of Mrs. Peel. US audiences saw the 1962\u20131964 Gale and Smith episodes of the series for the first time in the early 1990s when they were broadcast on the A&E Network. No Keel episode of the series was ever repeatedly broadcast outside Britain, contributing to the fact nearly all first-series episodes are now lost, and even in the UK only one surviving episode, \"The Frighteners\", was rebroadcast (as part of a run of classic episodes on Channel 4 in early 1993, otherwise mostly consisting of Gale episodes).\n\nHome media\nOnly three complete episodes from the show's first series, plus a portion of another episode, are known to exist, as 16mm film telerecordings. These are \"The Frighteners\" (an extract of which is playing on a television in the film Quadrophenia), \"Girl on the Trapeze\", which was found in the UCLA Film and Television Archive via an internet search of their on-line database, and \"Tunnel of Fear\", which was found in 2016. Additionally, part of the show's first episode was also found in the United States. The footage is of the episode's first 21 minutes, up to the first commercial break.\nAll series 2 and series 3 episodes survive as 16mm telerecordings. These have been released to DVD, as have all of the Emma Peel and Tara King episodes, which were shot on film. The two earlier-found surviving complete Keel episodes, plus the remnant of the first episode, have also been released in the UK and US, but are not currently available in the US. None of the original videotapes of series 1, 2 and 3 survive.\nFrom the late 1990s to the early 2000s, A&E TV Home Entertainment (under license from Canal+ Image International) released the remaining surviving series on Region 1 DVD in North America, with newly remastered picture and sound quality.\nSeries 4, 5 and 6 were remastered and released on Blu-ray by Studio Canal.\n\nSequel\nThe New Avengers\nThe sustained popularity of the Tara King episodes in France led to a 1975 French television advertisement for Laurent-Perrier champagne, in which Thorson and Macnee reprised their roles. The advertisement's success spurred financing interest in France for new episodes of The Avengers.\nThe result was a new series, The New Avengers. Patrick Macnee reprised the role of Steed, with two new partners, Mike Gambit (Gareth Hunt) and Purdey (Joanna Lumley). It aired on ITV in the UK in 1976\u20131977, CTV in Canada, CBS in the United States (in 1978\u201379) and TF1 in France (series 1 in 1976\u20131977 and series 2 in 1979). The final four episodes were almost completely produced by Canadian interests and were filmed there. In some markets they carried the title The New Avengers in Canada.\nAlthough Macnee was the only actor from the original series to reprise his role, archival footage of Diana Rigg allowed Emma Peel to make a cameo appearance in a second-season episode \"K is for Kill: The Tiger Awakes\", while Macnee's first co-star, Ian Hendry, made a guest appearance as a different character in the episode \"To Catch a Rat\".\n\nSpin-offs\nNovels\nA number of original novels based on the series were published in the 1960s. The first by Douglas Enefer, published by Consul Books, was the only 60s novel to feature Cathy Gale. Panther Books published four novels written by John Garforth featuring Emma Peel in the United Kingdom in 1967; Berkley Medallion Books reprinted these in the United States. After Panther stopped publishing Avengers novels in the UK, Berkley Medallion continued publishing original novels of their own: one featuring Peel and four featuring Tara King for the US market only; three by Keith Laumer in 1968; and two by Norman Daniels 1968\/69. Berkley Medallion later re-printed all nine novels with new covers that featured photos of both Rigg and Thorson, regardless of which Avengers girl appeared in the novel. The two novels published by Hodder and Stoughton in 1965\/66 were co-written by Patrick Macnee, making him one of the first actors to write licensed spin-off fiction of their own shows. The Macnee novels, Deadline and Dead Duck, were reprinted in the UK by Titan Books in standard paperback in 1994 and in France by Huitieme Art (1995 & 1996). They were also published in the US for the first time by TV Books in 1998. Titan reissued the books in trade paperback format (with the same covers) to coincide with the release of the 1998 feature film.\nThe 1990 novel Too Many Targets by John Peel featured all of Steed's partners (David Keel, Cathy Gale, Emma Peel and Tara King) with the exception of Venus Smith and Dr Martin King.\n\nThe Avengers, Douglas Enefer, 1963\nDeadline, Patrick Macnee and Peter Leslie, 1965\nDead Duck, Macnee and Leslie, 1966\nThe Floating Game, John Garforth, 1967\nThe Laugh Was on Lazarus, Garforth, 1967\nThe Passing of Gloria Munday, Garforth, 1967\nHeil Harris!, Garforth, 1967\nThe Afrit Affair, Keith Laumer, 1968\nThe Drowned Queen, Laumer, 1968\nThe Gold Bomb, Laumer, 1968\nThe Magnetic Man, Norman A.

A Tara short story, produced only in photocopied supplement format\nVol. 4 (1994). Contains two stories, Moonlight Express and The Spoilsports.\nToo Many Targets, John Peel and Rogers, 1990.\nThe Avengers, Julie Kaewert, 1998 (film novelisation)\nA short story by Peter Leslie entitled \"What's a Ghoul Like You Doing in a Place Like This?\" appeared in The Television Crimebusters Omnibus, a hardback anthology edited by Peter Haining, first published by Orion in 1994 (this Steed and Tara story first appeared in the 1969 UK Avengers annual, from Atlas publications). Both of the Macnee\/Leslie UK paperback titles were translated and published in Portugal in 1967 as Os Vingadores: O Dia Depois De Amanha (Deadline) and Os Vingadores: O Pato Morto (Dead Duck) by Deaga. All four UK John Garforth Panther book paperbacks were translated and published by Roman in France (1967), a paperback omnibus edition was published in 1998 by Fleuve Noir. Three of the Garforth paperbacks were also translated and published by Heyne in Germany (1967\/68) (Heil Harris! was not translated for obvious reasons) and a German hardback omnibus edition of the three titles was published by Lichtenberg (1968), reprinted in paperback by Heyne in 1998. All four titles were also translated and published in the Netherlands by Bruna (1967) and in Chile by Zig-Zag (1968).\n\nComics\nThe first UK Avengers comic strips, featuring Steed and Cathy Gale, first appeared in regional TV listings magazines Look Westward and The Viewer from 14 September 1963 to 9 May 1964 (and later in 1964, re-printed in the Manchester Evening News). This run consisted of four serials.\nSteed and Mrs Peel comic strips began in Polystyle Publications' TV Comic in issue #720, dated 2 October 1965, beginning after the TV debut of Emma Peel, and ran until issue #771, dated 24 September 1966 \u2013 this run consisted of 10 serials plus one 4-page one-off in TV Comic Holiday Special (June 1966). At that point the rights were sold to publishers D.C. Thomson & Co. Ltd, where the next version of the strip appeared in issue #199, dated 10 December 1966, of Diana the popular paper for girls. Its run ended in issue #224, dated 2 June 1967, with art by Emilio Frejo and Juan Gonzalez Alacrojo \u2013 this run consisted of 8 serials.\nEarlier, The Growing Up of Emma Peel comic strip had appeared in June and Schoolfriend comic from issue #52, dated 29 January 1966, to issue #63, dated 16 April 1966. This had featured the adventures of 14-year-old Emma Knight and was run concurrent with the TV Comic strip and consisted of 11 instalments.\nThe Avengers returned to TV Comic issue #877, dated 5 October 1968, just after Tara King debuted on TV, the Tara & Steed strip continued until issue #1077, dated 5 August 1972. This run consisted of 28 serials plus a 4-page one-off in TV Comic Holiday Special 1972. Also in 1966 Thorpe & Porter published a 68-page Avengers comic featuring Steed & Peel, with original art by Mick Anglo and Mick Austin \u2014 this consisted of four 16-page stories.\nA few Avengers-related comic books have been published in the USA. They are not named The Avengers because the rights to the names \"Avengers\" and \"New Avengers\" are held by Marvel Comics for use with their Avengers comics depicting a team of superheroes called The Avengers. Gold Key Comics published one issue of John Steed Emma Peel in 1968 (subtitled The Avengers on the Indicia page), which included two newly coloured and reformatted The Avengers strips from TV Comic.\nA 3-issue limited entitled Steed and Mrs. Peel appeared in 1990\u20131992 under the Acme Press\/Eclipse Comics imprint; it featured a three-part story, \"The Golden Game\" in issues #1\u20133, by Grant Morrison and a two-part story, in issues #2 & #3, \"A Deadly Rainbow\" by Anne Caulfield; both strips had art by Ian Gibson. Boom! Studios reprinted this series in six issues in early 2012, and later published a new ongoing series written by Mark Waid and Caleb Monroe which lasted 12 issues. Boom! subsequently announced a six-issue follow-up series, Steed and Mrs. Peel: We're Needed, which was launched in the summer of 2014. Despite issue #1 showing \"1 of 6\", only 3 issues were produced (\"2 of 3\" and \"3 of 3\" showing on the other issues, with the cover for issue #3 being the one originally planned for issue #4 which was planned to be the start of another 3-issue story).\nIn the UK, where hardback annuals are traditionally produced for sale at Christmas, The Avengers first appeared in TV Crimebusters Annual (1962) and featured a 7-page comic strip with Dr David Keel titled The Drug Pedlar. Atlas Publications produced three The Avengers hardback Annuals for 1967, 1968 and 1969, which also featured original Avengers comic strips featuring Steed, Emma Peel, and Tara King, as well as text stories.\nThe TV Comic Avengers strips and the 1966 Avengers comic and a few comic strips from the Annuals have been translated and published in Germany, the Netherlands, France, and Chile.\nThe Avengers also have made a number of cameo appearances in comics over the years:\n\nIn 1991's Doctor Who Magazine #173, Gary Russell and artists Mike Collins and Steve Pini show Captain Britain about to hit John Steed when Emma Peel shows up behind him.\nEmma Peel and John Steed were seen among the crowd in a bar scene in Kingdom Come #2 (1996) by Mark Waid and Alex Ross.\nEmma Peel and John Steed appeared unnamed in Superman #13 (1988) by John Byrne and Karl Kesel.\nA crossover series, Batman '66 Meets Steed and Mrs. Peel, was launched in June 2016 as a joint effort between DC Comics and Boom! Studios.\nAlan Moore's League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is littered with oblique references to events and characters in The Avengers, with three unnamed characters that are clearly Purdey, Tara and Emma appearing at the end of the book \"Century: 2009\".\n\nStage play\nA stage adaptation was produced in Britain in 1971, written by TV series veterans Brian Clemens and Terence Feely, and directed by Leslie Phillips. It starred Simon Oates as Steed, Sue Lloyd as new partner Hannah Wild, and Kate O'Mara as villainess Madame Gerda. All three had guest roles in the original series.\nA character named Hana Wilde (played by Charlotte Rampling) had essentially acted as Steed's partner in series five's \"The Superlative Seven\", an episode in which Emma Peel appears only briefly. According to John Peel in his overview of \"The Superlative Seven\", Charlotte Rampling was rumoured to be grooming up to replace Diana Rigg in this story, but nothing ever came of that\".\n\nRadio series\nA radio series was transmitted between 6 December 1971 and 28 December 1973 on Springbok Radio, the English-language service of the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC); it was recorded at Sonovision Studios in Johannesburg, produced by Dave Gooden, the original TV scripts were adapted and directed by Tony Jay, for the first six months and Dennis Folbigge for the remainder. South Africa did not have national television until 1976. The episodes were adapted from both Emma Peel and Tara King episodes (with Tara changed to Emma Peel throughout). The Avengers were played by two British expatriate actors, Donald Monat as Steed and Diane Appleby as Mrs Peel, with Hugh Rouse as the tongue-in-cheek narrator. The stories were adapted into five-episode serials under Tony Jay and six- and seven-episode serials under Dennis Folbigge, of approximately 15 minutes each (including adverts) and stripped across the week, Monday-Friday, on Springbok Radio.\nCurrently only 19 complete serials survive, all from reel-to-reel off-air recordings made by John Wright in 1972. Also, the first three episodes of a remake of Escape in Time currently exist. Episodes 1 and 2 are copies from the original Sonovision tapes, and episode 3 is from an off-air recording, on audio cassette, made by Barbara Peterson; the rest of this serial is still missing. These episodes are also known to have been transmitted in New York on station WBAI on 99.5 FM, from 1977 to the early 1990s, and are currently being transmitted on Miami station WRGP on early Monday mornings.\nCopies from the original off-air recordings have been restored by Alan and Alys Hayes, and can be heard at their \"The Avengers Declassified\" website and its sister website \"Avengers on the Radio\".\nMany more serials were broadcast during its two-year run on South African radio; it is thought 83 serials were made and transmitted, but no other episodes are known to exist at present.\n\nFilm\nPlans for a feature-length adaptation based upon the series circulated during the 1960s, 1980s and 1990s, with Mel Gibson at one point being considered a front-runner for the role of Steed. Ultimately, the 1998 film, starring Uma Thurman as Emma Peel and Ralph Fiennes as John Steed, with Sean Connery as the villain, received extremely negative reviews from critics and fans, and is a notorious commercial failure.\n\nAudio\nIn June 2013, Big Finish Productions signed a license with StudioCanal to produce full-cast audio productions of 12 lost first season episodes. The main cast includes Julian Wadham as Steed, Anthony Howell as Dr David Keel, and Lucy Briggs-Owen as Carol Wilson. The stories are adapted for audio by John Dorney.\nIn January 2014, Volume One, containing the first four stories, (\"Hot Snow\", \"Brought to Book\", \"Square Root of Evil\" and \"One for the Mortuary\") was released. Volume Two, containing the next four stories, (\"Ashes of Roses\", \"Please Don't Feed the Animals\", \"The Radioactive Man\" and \"Dance with Death\") was released in July 2014. Volume Three, containing the next four stories, was released in January 2015.\nIn March 2014, Big Finish extended the audio recreation programme to include all 26 season one episodes, including the then-two extant stories. A total of seven boxed sets were released.\n\nProposed reboots\nIn a 2023 interview, Charlie Higson said he and Paul Whitehouse had been offered an opportunity to helm a new series, but had declined.\nOn 18 January 2024, it was announced that Mickey Down and Konrad Kay were developing a reboot for StudioCanal.\n\nSee also\nList of The Avengers and The New Avengers cast members\nAvengerland, a variant of Metro-land\nHoney West\nThe Saint\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nThe Avengers by Dave Rogers (ITV Books in association with Michael Joseph Ltd., 1983)\nThe Avengers Anew by Dave Rogers (Michael Joseph Ltd., 1985)\nThe Complete Avengers by Dave Rogers (Boxtree Ltd., in Great Britain, 1989; St. Martin's Press, in America, 1989)\nThe Ultimate Avengers by Dave Rogers (Boxtree Ltd., in Great Britain, 1995)\nThe Avengers and Me by Patrick Macnee and Dave Rogers (New York: TV Books, 1997).\nThe Avengers Companion by Alain Carraz\u00e9 and Jean-Luc Putheaud, with Alex J.

Impressed by that book's strong sales, Martin Goodman, the owner of Marvel Comics predecessor Timely Comics, asked Stan Lee to create a title featuring a similar team of superheroes for Marvel. Lee recounts in Origins of Marvel Comics:\n\nMartin mentioned that he had noticed one of the titles published by National Comics seemed to be selling better than most. It was a book called The  [sic] Justice League of America and it was composed of a team of superheroes. ... 'If the Justice League is selling,' spoke he, 'why don't we put out a comic book that features a team of superheroes?'\nMuch like the Justice League, the Avengers were an assemblage of pre-existing superhero characters created by Lee and Jack Kirby. Kirby did the artwork for the first eight issues only, in addition to doing the layouts for issues #14\u201316. This initial series, published bi-monthly through issue #6 (July 1964) and monthly thereafter, ran through issue #402 (Sept. 1996), with spinoffs including several annuals, miniseries and a giant-size quarterly sister series that ran briefly in the mid-1970s. Marvel filed for a trademark for \"The Avengers\" in 1967 and the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued the registration in 1970.\nBetween 1996 and 2004, Marvel relaunched the primary Avengers title three times. In 1996, the \"Heroes Reborn\" line, in which Marvel contracted outside companies to produce four titles, included a new volume of The Avengers. It took place in an alternate universe, with a revamped history unrelated to mainstream Marvel continuity. The Avengers vol. 2 was written by Rob Liefeld and penciled by Jim Valentino, and ran for 13 issues (Nov. 1996\u2013Nov. 1997). The final issue, which featured a crossover with the other Heroes Reborn titles, returned the characters to the main Marvel Universe.\nThe Avengers vol. 3 relaunched and ran for 84 issues from February 1998 to August 2004. To coincide with what would have been the 500th issue of the original series, Marvel changed the numbering, and The Avengers #500-503 (Sept.\u2013 Dec. 2004), the one-shot Avengers Finale (Jan. 2005) became the \"Avengers Disassembled\" storyline and final issues. Avengers vol. 4 debuted in July 2010 and ran until January 2013. Vol. 5 was launched in February 2013. After Secret Wars, a new Avengers team debuted, dubbed the All-New, All-Different Avengers, starting with a Free Comic Book Day preview.\n\n1960s\nIn the first issue, the Avengers team began with Ant-Man (Hank Pym), Hulk (Bruce Banner), Iron Man (Anthony Stark), Thor, and the Wasp (Janet van Dyne). The roster changed almost immediately after the first issue; in the second issue, Ant-Man became Giant-Man, and at the end of the issue, Hulk quit the team. Issue #4 brought the title's first major milestone: the revival and return of Captain America (Steve Rogers).\n\n1970s\nThe creative team of writer Roy Thomas and artist John Buscema introduced new characters such as Arkon in issue #75 (April 1970) and Red Wolf in #80 (Sept. 1970). The team's adventures increased in scope as the team crossed into an alternate dimension and battled the Squadron Supreme, and fought in the Kree-Skrull War, which guest-starred the Kree hero, Mar-Vell\/Captain Marvel. Novelist Harlan Ellison plotted two stories for the series. The first (\"The Summons of Psyklop\") was published in issue #88 (May 1971) and the second (\"Five Dooms to Save Tomorrow\") in #101 (July 1972).\nWriter Steve Englehart introduced Mantis, who joined the team along with the reformed Swordsman.\nDuring the summer of 1973, Englehart and artists Bob Brown and Sal Buscema produced \"The Avengers-Defenders Clash\" storyline which crossed over between the two team titles. This eight-issue story was the first summertime cross-title event, and was very popular with readers.\nGeorge P\u00e9rez became the title's artist with issue #141 (Nov. 1975) which saw the start of a seven-part story featuring the Squadron Supreme and the Serpent Crown. In 2010, Comics Bulletin ranked Englehart's run on The Avengers eighth on its list of the \"Top 10 1970s Marvels\".\nAfter Englehart departed and a seven-issue stint by Gerry Conway, Jim Shooter began as writer, generating several classic adventures, including \"The Bride of Ultron\", the \"Nefaria Trilogy\", and \"The Korvac Saga\". Shooter introduced the character of Henry Peter Gyrich, the Avengers' liaison to the United States National Security Council. The true origins of Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch were revealed in a three-part story that ran in issues #185-187 (July-Sept. 1979).\n\n1980s\nThe first major development was the breakdown of Henry Pym, which writer Roger Stern resolved this by having Pym outwit Egghead and defeated the latest incarnation of the Masters of Evil single-handedly, and proved his innocence.\nStern developed several major storylines, such as \"Ultimate Vision\"; the formation of the West Coast Avengers; and \"Avengers Under Siege\". Rogue, who would later become a member of the X-Men, was introduced in The Avengers Annual #10 (1981) by writer Chris Claremont and artist Michael Golden.\nStern created the villain, Nebula, who falsely claimed to be the granddaughter of Thanos. Following Stern's departure, Walt Simonson wrote the series briefly but left due to editorial conflicts.\nJohn Byrne took over writing both West Coast Avengers and The Avengers and merged the two separate Avengers teams into one team with two bases. Byrne's contributions included a revamping of the Vision, and the discovery that the children of the Scarlet Witch and the Vision were actually illusions. The Avengers titles in late 1989 were involved in the major crossover event \"Acts of Vengeance\".\n\n1990s\nBob Harras and Steve Epting took over the title in the summer of 1991 and introduced a stable lineup with ongoing story lines and character development. Their primary antagonists in this run were the mysterious Proctor and his team of other-dimensional Avengers known as the Gatherers.\nThis culminated in \"Operation: Galactic Storm\", a 19-part storyline that ran through all Avengers-related titles and showcased a conflict between the Kree and the Shi'ar Empire.\nMarvel contracted out The Avengers and three related titles \u2014 Captain America, Fantastic Four, and Iron Man to former Marvel artists Jim Lee and Rob Liefeld, two of the founding creators of Image Comics. While The Avengers was relaunched as a new series, the \"Heroes Reborn\" line ended after a year as planned and the license reverted to Marvel.\nWriter Kurt Busiek and penciler George P\u00e9rez launched a new volume of the series with The Avengers vol. 3, #1 (Feb. 1998). Busiek concurrently wrote the limited series Avengers Forever. Busiek's run included many of the Avengers' traditional villains.\n\n2000s\nSuccessor writer Geoff Johns dealt with the aftermath of Busiek's Kang arc, as the Avengers were granted international authority by the United Nations. Chuck Austen followed as writer. Writer Brian Michael Bendis then rebooted the series with the \"Avengers Disassembled\" storyline.\n\n2010s\nAll four Avengers series (The Mighty Avengers, New Avengers, Dark Avengers, and Avengers: The Initiative) were canceled, and a new ongoing series titled Avengers was launched in May 2010, written by Brian Michael Bendis and penciled by John Romita Jr.\nIn 2012, a biweekly Avengers title was launched, written by Jonathan Hickman and drawn by different artists for each story arc. After Secret Wars, a new Avengers title (vol. 6) dubbed the All-New, All-Different Avengers launched in 2015 written by Mark Waid, with alternating artwork by Mahmud Asrar and Adam Kubert, and covers by Alex Ross. Mark Waid and Alex Ross continued with Avengers vol. 7, which launched in 2017, with artwork by Mike del Mundo.\nIt was relaunched once again in 2018 as part of Marvel's \"Fresh Start\" relaunch featuring a creative by Jason Aaron (w) and Ed McGuinness (pen).\n\nContributors\nVol. 1 (1963\u20131996, 2004, 2017\u20132018)\nWriters\nPencilers\nVol. 2 (1996\u20131997)\nWriters\nPencilers\nVol. 3 (1998\u20132004)\nWriters\nPencilers\nVol. 4 (2010\u20132013)\nWriters\nPencilers\nVol. 5 (2013\u20132015)\nWriters\nPencilers\nVol. 6 (2015\u20132016)\nWriters\nPencilers\nVol. 7 (2017)\nWriters\nPencilers\nVol. 8 (2018\u20132023)\nWriters\nPencilers\nVol. 9 (2023\u2013present)\nWriters\nPencilers\nCast\nCollected editions\nAvengers Vol. 1\nOmnibus\nMarvel Masterworks\n(hardcover only after Volume 6)\n\nEpic Collections\nOther Collections\nAvengers Vol. 2\nAvengers Vol. 3\nOmnibus\nComplete Collections\nNB: The Avengers Assemble volumes comprise most of the Busiek and P\u00e9rez run.\n\nHardcovers\nNB: The Avengers Assemble volumes and Avengers: Disassembled are oversized.\n\nTrade Paperbacks\nAvengers Vol. 4\nAvengers Vol. 5\nAvengers Vol. 5, entirely written by Jonathan Hickman, is best read in tandem with his concurrent New Avengers Vol. 3.

It was released by Hollywood Records on May 1, 2012. A separate soundtrack and concept album, titled Avengers Assemble (Music from and Inspired by the Motion Picture), by various artists was also released on the same date.\n\nThe Avengers (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\nIn November 2011, Marvel announced that Alan Silvestri, who scored Captain America: The First Avenger, would write and compose the score for The Avengers (making him the first composer to score more than one movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe). Silvestri stated, \"This is actually a very unique experience [for me]. I've worked on films where there have been a number of stars and certainly worked on films where there have been characters of equal weight in terms of their level of importance and profile in the film, but this one is somewhat extreme in that regard because each of these characters has their own world and it's a very different situation. It's very challenging to look for a way to give everyone the weight and consideration they need, but at the same time the film is really about the coming together of these characters, which implies that there is this entity called the Avengers, which really has to be representative of all of them together.\" Silvestri recorded the score at Abbey Road Studios in London, England. Avengers director Joss Whedon described the score as \"old school\", saying \"the score is very old-fashioned, which is why [Silvestri] was letter perfect for this movie because he can give you the heightened emotion, the [Hans Zimmer] school of 'I'm just feeling a lot right now!' but he can also be extraordinarily cue and character specific, which I love.\" Silvestri reprises his themes from Captain America: The First Avenger, and introduced new ones - including the theme for Black Widow, which is \"a lonely, plucked theme with an Eastern European flavor to define this character\". The score album was released on May 1, 2012.\n\nTrack listing\nSimultaneously with the digital release, the album was physically released by Hollywood Records, Marvel Music, and Intrada Records. Several tracks on this release are longer than on the digital album and there is one additional track, \"Interrogation\".\n\nAvengers Assemble (Music from and Inspired by the Motion Picture)\nIn March 2012, American alternative rock band Soundgarden announced through their official Facebook page that they had written a song to be included on the film's soundtrack, entitled \"Live to Rise\". The song was released on April 17, 2012, as a free digital download during its first week of availability in the iTunes Store. Additionally, Indian rock band Agnee released a music video for their single \"Hello Andheron\", which served as the theme song for the Indian release of the film. The following day, Marvel released the album's full track listing, which was released by Hollywood Records on May 1, 2012. A cover of AC\/DC's song \"Shoot to Thrill\", performed by Theory of a Deadman, was originally to be included on the album, but was removed for unknown reasons.\n\nTrack listing\nNone of these songs, with the exception of \"Live to Rise,\" are heard in the film.\n\nCharts\nReferences\nExternal links\nMusic video of \"Live to Rise\"\nMusic video of \"Comeback\"","102":"The Avengers is a cancelled first-person brawler video game set to be released in 2012, to coincide with the release of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film of the same name. The game was not tied or based around the film, but rather an original story, inspired by the \"Secret Invasion\" storyline in the comics.\n\nGameplay\nGameplay was to be co-op, between four players offline and online, with teamwork being an essential mechanic. Each of the playable characters, such as Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, and Thor, would have a unique play style. Iron Man being able to fly while the Hulk had the strongest melee attacks. Assist attacks allowed players to stun enemies, leaving them open to be finished off by other players, such as Thor summoning lightning with Captain America finishing off the opponent using his shield. Players could also earn experience points from performing a series of melee attack combos on stunned enemies, which would go on to unlock additional abilities. \"Hero boosts\" used by the player could increase stats of other players depending on the character, such as Iron Man creating energy shields around allies for a limited time. Other characters, such as Black Widow, Hawkeye, War Machine, Ms. Marvel, the Fantastic Four, and Ant-Man, were also considered to be unlockable characters or included as NPCs.\nThe Skrull army were to have unique abilities based on a variety of superheroes such as the Fantastic Four, X-Men, and the Avengers, with bosses, such as Veranke and a giant Super-Skrull.\n\nDevelopment and cancellation\nIn 2010, THQ acquired the rights from Marvel with development handled by THQ Studio Australia with outsourced development handled by Blue Tongue Entertainment to create a video game based on several characters from the Avengers. The game chosen to be in first-person came from the developers wanting to try something different from previous games based on Marvel's properties, wanting the player to see through the eyes of characters such as Captain America, Hulk, Thor and Iron Man. The story was to be an original one borrowing elements from the \"Secret Invasion\" story in the comics with Brian Michael Bendis, who wrote the arc, brought in to script the game's story.\nPlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 were the main consoles of development with Blue Tongue Entertainment handling the PC port. Plans for a Wii U was also considered around the system's launch and console features such as the Kinect for a mode called \"Avengers Training Academy\" which would have the player take control of a rookie superhero to fight along The Avengers using motion controls, but both were later cut during pre-production.\nDuring mid 2011, the game was struggling to keep up with development with THQ's financial problems with Homefront and the uDraw peripheral costing the company $100 million and the value of the Australian dollar to rise, causing THQ to pay their employees in Australia more than their domestic divisions which led to the decision to shut down both THQ Studio Australia and Blue Tongue Entertainment. In the last few weeks of the developers being shut down, they reached out to Marvel Entertainment in hopes to continue funding and developing the title, which Marvel refused to with the game officially being cancelled.\nAfter the game's cancellation, THQ sold off their properties, with Ubisoft acquiring the license to make their own tie-in game to the film, borrowing some of the game's concepts and story to create Marvel Avengers: Battle for Earth for Xbox 360 and Wii U, released on October 20, 2012.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nUnseen64 on the history of The Avengers Video Game","103":"The Avengers is a British espionage television series, created in 1961, that ran for 161 episodes until 1969. It initially focused on David Keel (Ian Hendry), aided by John Steed (Patrick Macnee). Ian Hendry left after the first series; Steed then became the main character, partnered with a succession of assistants. His most famous assistants were intelligent, stylish, and assertive women: Cathy Gale (Honor Blackman), Emma Peel (Diana Rigg), and Tara King (Linda Thorson). Dresses and suits for the series were made by Pierre Cardin.\nThe series screened as one-hour episodes for its entire run. The first episode, \"Hot Snow\", aired on 7 January 1961. The final episode, \"Bizarre\", aired on 21 April 1969 in the United States, and on 17 May 1969 in the United Kingdom.\nThe Avengers was produced by ABC Weekend TV, a contractor within the ITV network. After a merger with Rediffusion London in July 1968, ABC Weekend became Thames Television, which continued production of the series, subcontracted to ABC Television Films. By 1969, The Avengers was shown in more than 90 countries. ITV produced a sequel series, The New Avengers (1976\u20131977), with Patrick Macnee returning as John Steed, and two new partners. In 2004 and 2007, The Avengers was ranked No. 17 and No. 20 on TV Guide's Top Cult Shows Ever.\n\nPremise\nThe Avengers was marked by different eras as co-stars came and went. The only constant was John Steed, played by Patrick Macnee.\n\nSeries 1 (1961)\nABC Weekend TV produced a single series of Police Surgeon, in which Ian Hendry played police surgeon Geoffrey Brent, from September through December 1960. While Police Surgeon did not last long, viewers praised Ian Hendry, and ABC Television cast him in its new series The Avengers, which replaced Police Surgeon in January 1961.\nThe Avengers began with the episode \"Hot Snow\", in which medical doctor David H. Keel (Hendry) investigates the murder of his fianc\u00e9e, office receptionist Peggy, by a drug ring. A stranger named John Steed who was also investigating the ring appears, and together Dr. Keel and Steed set out to avenge Peggy's death in the first two episodes. Steed asks Dr. Keel to partner with him, as needed, to solve crimes. Ian Hendry was considered the star of the new series, receiving top billing over Patrick Macnee, and Steed did not appear in two of the series' episodes.\nAs the first series of The Avengers progressed, Steed's importance increased, and he carried the final episode solo. While Steed and Dr. Keel used wit while discussing crimes and dangers, the series also depicted the interplay\u2014and often tension\u2014between Dr. Keel's idealism and Steed's professionalism. As seen in one of the three surviving episodes from the first series, \"The Frighteners\", Steed also had informants among the general population to aid his investigations, similar to the \"Baker Street Irregulars\" of Sherlock Holmes.\nThe other regular in the first series was Carol Wilson (Ingrid Hafner), the nurse and receptionist who replaced the slain Peggy. Carol assisted Dr. Keel and Steed in cases, and in at least one episode (\"Girl on the Trapeze\") was very much in the thick of the action, but without being part of Steed's inner circle. Ingrid Hafner had played opposite Ian Hendry as a nurse in one episode of Police Surgeon. The role of Carol Wilson was initially offered to Jan Watson, who turned it down for another film.\nThe series was shot on 405-line videotape using a multicamera setup. There was little provision for editing and virtually no location footage was shot (although the first shot of the first episode consisted of location footage). As was standard practice at the time, videotapes of early episodes of The Avengers were reused. At present, only three complete Series 1 episodes are known to exist and are held in archives as 16-mm film telerecordings: \"Girl on the Trapeze\" (which does not feature Steed), \"The Frighteners\" and \"Tunnel of Fear\". Additionally, the first 15 minutes of the first episode, \"Hot Snow\", also exist as a telerecording; the extant footage ends at the conclusion of the first act, prior to the introduction of John Steed.\nThe missing television episodes were recreated for audio by Big Finish Productions under the title of The Avengers \u2013 The Lost Episodes and star Julian Wadham as Steed, Anthony Howell as Dr Keel and Lucy Briggs-Owen as Carol Wilson.\n\nSeries 2\u20133 (1962\u20131964)\nProduction of the first series was cut short by a strike. By the time production could begin on the second series, Ian Hendry had quit to pursue a film career. Patrick Macnee was promoted to star, and Steed became the focus of the series, initially working with a rotation of three different partners. Dr Martin King (Jon Rollason), a thinly disguised recreation of the Dr. Keel character, saw action in only three episodes, which were produced from scripts written for the first series. Dr. King was intended to be a transitional character between Dr. Keel and Steed's two new female partners, but while the Dr. King episodes were shot first, they were shown out of production order in the middle of the season. The character was thereafter quickly and quietly dropped.\nNightclub singer Venus Smith (Julie Stevens) appeared in six episodes. She was a complete \"amateur\", meaning that she did not have any professional crime-fighting skills as did the two doctors. She was excited to be participating in a spy adventure alongside secret agent Steed (although some episodes\u2014\"The Removal Men\", \"The Decapod\"\u2014indicate she is not always enthusiastic). Nonetheless, she appears to be attracted to him, and their relationship is somewhat similar to that later portrayed between Steed and Tara King. Her episodes featured live musical portions showcasing her singing performances. The character of Venus underwent some revision during her run, adopting more youthful demeanour and dress.\nThe first episode broadcast in the second series introduced the partner who would change the show into the format for which it is most remembered. Honor Blackman played Mrs. Cathy Gale, a self-assured, quick-witted anthropologist who was skilled in judo and had a passion for leather clothes. Widowed during the Mau Mau rebellion years in Kenya, she was the \"talented amateur\" who provided her aid to Steed's cases as a service to her nation. She was said to have been born on 5 October 1930 at midnight, and was reared in Africa. Mrs. Catherine Gale was in her early-to-mid 30s during her tenure, in contrast to female characters in similar series who tended to be younger.\nCatherine Gale was unlike any female character seen before on British TV, and she became a household name. Reportedly, part of her charm was because her earliest appearances were episodes in which dialogue written for Keel was simply transferred to her. Series scriptwriter Dennis Spooner described about this detail: \"There's the famous story of how Honor Blackman played Ian Hendry's part, which is why they stuck her in leather and such\u2014it was so much cheaper than changing the lines!\" In \"Conspiracy of Silence\", she holds her own in a vociferous tactical disagreement with her partner.\nVenus Smith did not return for the third series, and Cathy Gale became Steed's only regular partner. The series established a level of sexual tension between Steed and Cathy Gale, but the writers were not allowed to go beyond flirting and innuendo. Despite this, the relationship between Steed and Catherine Gale was progressive for 1962\u201363. In \"The Golden Eggs,\" it is revealed that Cathy Gale lived in Steed's flat; according to Steed, her rent was to keep the refrigerator well-stocked and to cook for him (she appears to do neither). However, this was said to be a temporary arrangement while Catherine Gale looked for a new home, and Steed was sleeping at a hotel.\nDuring the first series, there were hints that Steed worked for a branch of British Intelligence, and this was expanded in the second series. Steed initially received orders from different superiors, including someone referred to as \"Charles\", and \"One-Ten\" (Douglas Muir). By the third series, the delivery of Steed's orders was not depicted on screen or explained. The secret organisation to which Steed belongs is shown in \"The Nutshell\", and it is Cathy Gale's first visit to their headquarters.\nSmall references to Steed's background were occasionally made. In the Series 3 episode \"Death of a Batman,\" it was said that Steed was with I Corps in the Second World War, and in Munich in 1945. In the Series 4 episode \"The Hour That Never Was,\" Steed attends a reunion of his RAF squadron. Since the ties he wears are either cavalry or old school, it is apparent that he has attended a number of leading public schools.\nA theatrical film version of the series was in its initial planning stages by late 1963, after Series 3 was completed. An early story proposal paired Steed and Catherine Gale with a male and female duo of American agents, to make the movie appeal to the American market. Before the project could gain momentum, Honor Blackman was cast opposite Sean Connery in Goldfinger, requiring her to leave the series.\n\nSeries transformation\nDuring the Gale era, Steed was transformed from a rugged trenchcoat-wearing agent into the stereotypical English gentleman, complete with Savile Row suit, bowler hat and umbrella, with clothes later designed by Pierre Cardin. (Steed had first donned bowler and carried his distinctive umbrella during the first series, as \"The Frighteners\" depicts.) The bowler and umbrella were soon revealed to be full of tricks, including a sword hidden within the umbrella handle and a steel plate concealed in the hat. These items were referred to in the French, German and Polish titles of the series, Chapeau melon et bottes de cuir (\"Bowler hat and leather boots\"), Mit Schirm, Charme und Melone (\"With Umbrella, Charm and Bowler Hat\") and Rewolwer i melonik (\"A Revolver and a Bowler Hat\"), respectively. With his impeccable manners, old-world sophistication and vintage car, Steed came to represent the traditional Englishman of an earlier era.\nBy contrast, Steed's partners were youthful, forward-looking and always attired in the latest mod fashions. Catherine Gale's innovative leather outfits suited her many athletic fight scenes. Honor Blackman became a star in Britain with her black leather outfits and boots (nicknamed \"kinky boots\") and her judo-based fighting style. Patrick Macnee and Honor Blackman even released a novelty song called \"Kinky Boots\". Honor Blackman also carried a pistol in \"Killer Whale\". Some of the clothes seen in The Avengers were designed at the studio of John Sutcliffe, who published the AtomAge fetish magazine.\nSeries scriptwriter Dennis Spooner said that the series would frequently feature Steed visiting busy public places such as the main airport in London without anyone else present in the scene: \"'Can't you afford extras?' they'd ask. Well, it wasn't like that. It's just that Steed had to be alone to be accepted. Put him in a crowd and he sticks out like a sore thumb! Let's face it, with normal people he's weird. The trick to making him acceptable is never to show him in a normal world, just fighting villains who are odder than he is!\"\n\nSeries 4\u20135 (1965\u20131967)\nThe show was sold to the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in 1965, and The Avengers became one of the first British series to be aired on prime-time US television. The US ABC network paid the then-unheard-of sum of $2 million for the first 26 episodes. The average budget for each episode was reportedly \u00a356,000, which was high for the British industry. The fourth series aired in the US from March to the beginning of September 1966. Each episode still finished with the logo of ABC Weekend TV.\nThe US deal meant that the producers could afford to start shooting the series on 35mm film, with production transferring from ABC's television studios in Teddington to the Associated British film studios in Elstree. The use of film, rather than the videotape of the earlier episodes, was essential, because British 405-line video was technically incompatible with the US NTSC videotape format. Filmed productions were standard on US prime-time television at the time. The Avengers continued to be produced in black-and-white.\nThe transfer to film meant that episodes would be shot using the single-camera setup, giving the production greater flexibility. The use of film production and the single-camera production style allowed more sophisticated visuals and camera angles, and more outdoor location shots, all of which greatly improved the look of the series. As was standard on British television filmed production through the 1960s, all location work on Series 4 was shot mute, with the soundtrack created in post-production. Dialogue scenes were filmed in the studio, leading to some jumps between location and studio footage.\n\nNew female partner Mrs. Emma Peel (Diana Rigg) debuted in October 1965. The name of the character derived from a comment by writers, during development, that they wanted a character with \"man appeal\". In an early attempt to incorporate this concept into the character's name, she was called \"Samantha Peel\", shortened to the awkward \"Mantha Peel\". Eventually, the writers began referring to the idea by the verbal shorthand \"M. Appeal\", which gave rise to the character's ultimate name.\nAfter more than 60 actresses had been auditioned, the first choice to play the role was Elizabeth Shepherd. However, after filming one and a half episodes (the pilot, \"The Town of No Return\", and part of \"The Murder Market\"), Elizabeth Shepherd was released. Her on-screen personality was deemed less interesting than that of Honor Blackman's Catherine Gale, and it was decided that she was not right for the role. Another 20 actresses were auditioned before the show's casting director, Dodo Watts, suggested that producers Brian Clemens and Albert Fennell check out a televised drama featuring the relatively unknown Diana Rigg. (She had earlier guested in an episode of The Sentimental Agent that Brian Clemens had written.) Diana Rigg's screen test with Patrick Macnee showed that the two immediately worked well together.\nA prologue was added to the beginning of all the fourth-series episodes for the American broadcasts. This was to clarify some initial confusion audiences had regarding the characters and their mission. In the opener, a waiter holding a champagne bottle falls dead onto a human-sized chessboard, a dagger protruding from a target on his back. Steed and Mrs. Emma Peel (dressed in her trademark leather catsuit) walk up to the body as the voice-over explains: \"Extraordinary crimes against the people, and the state, have to be avenged by agents extraordinary. Two such people are John Steed, top professional, and his partner Emma Peel, talented amateur. Otherwise known as The Avengers\". During this voice-over, Steed pours two drinks from the wine bottle and Mrs. Peel replaces her gun in her boot. They clink glasses and depart together as the screen fades to black and the opening titles begin.\n\nIn contrast to the Gale episodes, there is a lighter, comic touch in Steed's and Mrs. Emma Peel's interactions with each other and their reactions to other characters and situations. Earlier series had a harder tone, with the Gale era including some quite serious espionage dramas. This almost completely disappeared as Steed and Mrs. Emma Peel visibly enjoy topping each other's witticisms. The layer of conflict with Catherine Gale\u2014who on occasion openly resented being used by Steed, often without her permission\u2014is absent from Steed's interaction with Emma Peel. Also, the sexual tension between Steed and Catherine Gale is quite different from the tension between Steed and Emma Peel. In both cases, the exact relationship between the partners is left ambiguous, although they seemed to have carte blanche to visit each other's homes whenever they please, and it is not uncommon for scenes to suggest that Steed had spent the night at Catherine Gale's or Emma Peel's home, or vice versa. Although nothing \"improper\" is displayed, the close chemistry between Steed and Mrs. Emma Peel constantly suggests intimacy between the two.\nScience fiction and fantasy elements (a style later known as Spy-Fi) also began to emerge in storylines. The duo encounters killer robots (\"The Cybernauts\"), telepaths (\"Too Many Christmas Trees\") and giant alien carnivorous plants (\"The Man-Eater of Surrey Green\").\nIn her fourth episode, \"Death at Bargain Prices,\" Mrs. Emma Peel takes an undercover job at a department store. Her uniform for promoting space-age toys is an elaborate leather catsuit plus silver boots, sash and welder's gloves. The suit (minus the silver accessories) became her signature outfit, which she wore primarily for fight scenes in early episodes and in the titles. Some episodes contain a fetishistic undercurrent. In \"A Touch of Brimstone\", Mrs. Peel dresses in a dominatrix outfit of corset, laced boots and spiked collar to become the \"Queen of Sin\".\n\nEmma Peel's avant-garde fashions, featuring bold accents and high-contrast geometric patterns, emphasise her youthful, contemporary personality. For the 1965 season, some of her most memorable outfits were designed by John Bates, including graphic black-and-white Op art mini-coats and accessories, and a silver ensemble comprising a bra bodice, low-slung trousers and jacket. She represents the modern England of the Sixties \u2013 just as Steed, with his vintage style and mannerisms, personifies Edwardian-era nostalgia. According to Patrick Macnee in his book The Avengers and Me, Diana Rigg disliked wearing leather and insisted on a new line of fabric athletic wear for the fifth series. Alun Hughes, who had designed clothing for Diana Rigg's personal wardrobe, was suggested by the actress to design Emma Peel's \"softer\" new wardrobe. Pierre Cardin was brought in to design a new wardrobe for Macnee. In the US, TV Guide ran a four-page photo spread on Diana Rigg's new \"Emmapeeler\" outfits (10\u201316 June 1967). Eight tight-fitting jumpsuits were created, in a variety of bright colours and made of the stretch fabric crimplene.\n\nMove to colour\nAfter one filmed series (of 26 episodes) in black and white, The Avengers began filming in colour for the fifth series in 1966. It was three years before Britain's ITV network began full colour broadcasting. The first 16 episodes of this series were broadcast concurrently in the US, in colour, and the UK, in black and white, from January to May 1967. Eight further episodes were broadcast in the UK beginning in late September, while these episodes were withheld in the US until early 1968, where they would be immediately succeeded by the first batch of episodes featuring Diana Rigg's replacement, Linda Thorson. The American prologue of the fourth series was modified for the colour episodes. The show opened with the caption The Avengers in Color (required by the US ABC for colour series at that time), followed by Steed unwrapping the foil from a champagne bottle and Emma Peel shooting the cork away. Unlike the \"chessboard\" opening of the previous series, this new prologue had no narrative voice-over, and the scene was also included in UK broadcasts of the series. At the end of the closing credits, all previous series had ended with the ABC Weekend TV logo, but the fifth and sixth series \u2014 now made by ABC's sister company A.B.C. Television Films \u2014 instead featured an animation where the letters \"ABC\" were revealed to stand for \"Associated British Corporation\", a name apparently invented for ABC shows exported to the US to avoid confusion with the US ABC network. (The legal name of ABC Weekend TV was originally \"Associated British Cinemas (Television) Ltd\", later shortened to \"A.B.C. Television Ltd\".)\nThe first 16 episodes of the fifth series begin with Emma Peel receiving a call-to-duty message from Steed: \"Mrs. Peel, we're needed\". Emma Peel would be conducting her normal activities when she unexpectedly received a message on a calling card or within a delivered gift, at which point Steed suddenly appeared (usually in her apartment). \nThe series also introduced a comic tagline caption to the episode title, using the format of \"Steed [does this], Emma [does that]\". For example, \"The Joker\" had the opening caption: \"Steed trumps an ace, Emma plays a lone hand\". \"The Joker\" was to a large extent a rewrite of \"Don't Look Behind You\", a black-and-white Cathy Gale episode. Three other colour Emma Peel episodes were rewrites of Cathy Gale episodes.\nThe \"Mrs Peel, we're needed\" scenes and the alternate taglines were dropped after the first 16 episodes, after a break in production, for financial reasons. They were deemed by the UK networks as disposable if The Avengers was to return to ITV screens (Dave Rogers' book The Avengers Anew lists a set for every Steed\/Emma Peel episode except \"The Forget-Me-Knot\").\nStories were increasingly characterised by a futuristic, science-fiction bent, with mad scientists and their creations wreaking havoc. The duo dealt with being shrunk to doll size (\"Mission... Highly Improbable\"), pet cats being electrically altered to become ferocious and lethal \"miniature tigers\" (\"The Hidden Tiger\"), killer automata (\"Return of The Cybernauts\"), mind-transferring machines (\"Who's Who???\") and invisible foes (\"The See-Through Man\").\nThe series parodied its American contemporaries with episodes such as \"The Girl From AUNTIE\", \"Mission... Highly Improbable\" and \"The Winged Avenger\" (spoofing The Man from U.N.C.L.E., Mission: Impossible and Batman, respectively). The show still carried the basic format: Steed and his associate were charged with solving the problem in the space of a 50-minute episode, thus preserving the safety of 1960s Britain.\nHumour was evident in the names and acronyms of the organisations. For example, in \"The Living Dead,\" two rival groups examine reported ghost sightings: FOG (Friends of Ghosts) and SMOG (Scientific Measurement of Ghosts). \"The Hidden Tiger\" features the Philanthropic Union for Rescue, Relief and Recuperation of Cats\u2014PURRR\u2014led by characters named Cheshire, Manx and Angora.\nThe series also occasionally adopted a metafictional tone, coming close to breaking the fourth wall. In the Series 5 episode \"Something Nasty in the Nursery\", Emma Peel directly refers to the series' storytelling convention of having potentially helpful sources of information killed off just before she or Steed arrive. This then occurs a few minutes later. In the tag scene for the same episode, Steed and Emma Peel tell viewers\u2014indirectly\u2014to tune in next week.\nDiana Rigg's stunt double was stuntwoman Cyd Child, though stuntman Peter Elliot doubled for Diana Rigg in a stunt dive in \"The Bird Who Knew Too Much\".\n\nDiana Rigg's departure\nDiana Rigg was initially unhappy with the way she was treated by the show's producers. During her first series, she learned that she was being paid less than the cameraman. She demanded a raise to put her more on a par with her co-star, or she would leave the show. The producers gave in, thanks to the show's great popularity in the US. At the end of the fifth series in 1967, Diana Rigg left to pursue other projects. This included following Honor Blackman to play a leading role in a James Bond film, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, as James Bond's wife Tracy Bond.\nPatrick Macnee and Diana Rigg remained lifelong friends.\nOn 25 October 2015, to mark 50 years of Emma Peel, the BFI (British Film Institute) screened an episode of The Avengers followed by an onstage interview with Diana Rigg, during which she discussed her reasons for leaving the show and Patrick Macnee's reaction to her departure.\n\nSeries 6 (1968\u20131969)\nWhen Diana Rigg left the series in October 1967, the British network executives decided that the current series formula, despite resulting in popular success, could not be pursued further. Thus, they decided that a \"return to realism\" was appropriate for the sixth series (1968\u201369). Brian Clemens and Albert Fennell were replaced by John Bryce, producer of most of the Cathy Gale-era episodes.\nJohn Bryce had a difficult situation to handle. He had to find a replacement for Diana Rigg and shoot the first seven episodes of the new series, which were supposed to be shipped to the US together with the last eight Emma Peel colour episodes. Bryce signed his then-girlfriend, 20-year-old newcomer Linda Thorson, as the new female co-star and chose the name Tara King for her character. Linda Thorson played the role with more innocence in mind and at heart, and unlike the previous partnerships with Cathy Gale and Emma Peel, the writers allowed subtle hints of romance to blossom between Steed and Tara King. Tara King also differed from Steed's previous partners in that she was a fully fledged (albeit initially inexperienced) agent working for Steed's organisation; his previous partners had all been (in the words of the prologue used for American broadcasts of the first Rigg series) talented amateurs. Bryce wanted Tara to be blonde, so Linda Thorson's brown hair was bleached. However, the process badly damaged Linda Thorson's hair, so she had to wear wigs for the first third of her episodes, until her own hair grew back. Her natural brown hair was not seen until the episode, \"All Done with Mirrors.\"\nProduction of the first seven episodes of the sixth series began, but the financial problems and internal difficulties undermined John Bryce's effort. He only managed to complete three episodes: \"Invitation to a Killing\" (a 90-minute episode introducing Tara King), \"The Great, Great Britain Crime\" (some of its original footage was reused in the 1969 episode \"Homicide and Old Lace\"), and \"Invasion of the Earthmen\" (which survived relatively intact except for the scenes in which Tara wears a brown wig).\nAfter a rough cut screening of these episodes to studio executives, John Bryce was fired and Brian Clemens and Albert Fennell were summoned back. At their return, a fourth episode called \"The Murderous Connection\" was in its second day of production. After revising the script, it was renamed as \"The Curious Case of the Countless Clues\" and production resumed. Production of the episode \"Split!\", a leftover script from the Emma Peel colour series, proceeded. Two completely new episodes were also shot: \"Get-A-Way\", and \"Look (Stop Me If You've Heard This One) But There Were These Two Fellers\".\n\nDennis Spooner said of the event:Brian left The Avengers for about three episodes, someone took over, and when Brian came back, it was in a terrible state. He was faced with doing a rewrite on a film they'd already shot. The episode had a story error where Steed leaves for a destination. The villains then realise this and pursue him \u2013 yet arrive there before Steed does. It was fixed by having a character ask Steed 'What took you so long?', to which he replies 'I came the pretty way'. \"You can only do that on The Avengers you see. It was just my favourite show to work on.\nBrian Clemens and Albert Fennell decided to film a new episode to introduce Tara King. This, the third episode filmed for the sixth series, was titled \"The Forget-Me-Knot\" and bade farewell to Emma Peel and introduced her successor, a trained but inexperienced agent named Tara King. It would be broadcast as the first episode of the sixth series. Tara debuts in dynamic style: when Steed is called to Headquarters, he is attacked and knocked down by trainee agent Tara King, who mistakes him for her training partner.\nNo farewell scenes for Emma Peel had been shot when Diana Rigg left the series. She was recalled for \"The Forget-Me-Knot\", through which Emma acts as Steed's partner as usual. Diana Rigg also filmed a farewell scene for Emma that appeared as the tag scene of the episode. It was explained that Emma's husband, Peter Peel, was found alive and rescued, and she left the British secret service to be with him. Emma visits Steed to say goodbye, and while leaving she passes Tara on the stairway giving the advice that \"he likes his tea stirred anti-clockwise\". Steed looks out of the window as a departing Emma enters the Bentley driven by Peter, who from a distance seems to resemble Steed (and was played by Steed's regular stunt double, with bowler hat and umbrella).\nJohn Bryce's original episode introducing Tara, \"Invitation to a Killing\", was revised as a regular 60-minute episode named \"Have Guns Will Haggle\". These episodes, together with \"Invasion of the Earthmen\" and the last eight Emma Peel colour episodes, were shipped to the US in February 1968.\nFor this series the government official who gave Steed his orders was depicted on screen. Mother, introduced in \"The Forget-Me-Knot,\" is a man in a wheelchair. The role was taken by Patrick Newell, who had played different roles in two earlier episodes, most recently in Series 5. Mother's headquarters would shift from place to place, including one episode in which his complete office was on the top level of a double-decker bus. Several James Bond films of the 1970s would make use of a similar gimmick for Bond's briefings.\nAdded later as a regular was Mother's mute Amazonian assistant, Rhonda, played by uncredited actress Rhonda Parker. There was one appearance by an agency official code-named \"Father\", a blind older woman played by Iris Russell. (Iris Russell had appeared in the series several times previously in other roles.) In one episode, \"Killer\", Steed is paired with Lady Diana Forbes Blakeney (Jennifer Croxton) while King is on holiday.\nScriptwriter Dennis Spooner later reflected: \"When I wrote 'Look (Stop Me If You've Heard This One) But There Were These Two Fellers', that was definitely the last series. They were going to make no more, so in that series we went right over the top; we went really weird, because they knew there weren't going to be any more\".\nDennis Spooner said the series \"worked because it became a parody on itself, almost. You can only do that so long.\" He attributes the overall success of the show to its light approach: \"We spoofed everything; we took Mission: Impossible, Bad Day at Black Rock, High Noon, The Dirty Dozen, The Birds... we took them all. The film buffs used to love it. There were always lines in it that people knew what we were talking about\".\nThe revised series continued to be broadcast in the US. The episodes with Linda Thorson as Tara King proved to be highly rated in Europe and the UK. However, in the US, the ABC network chose to air it opposite the number-one show in the country at the time, Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In. Steed and Tara King could not compete, and the show was cancelled in the US. Without this vital commercial backing, production could not continue in Britain either, and the series ended in May 1969. The final scene of the final episode (\"Bizarre\") has Steed and Tara King, champagne glasses in hand, accidentally launching themselves into orbit aboard a rocket, as Mother breaks the fourth wall and says to the audience \"They'll be back!\", before adding in shock \"They're unchaperoned up there!\"\n\nCast\nPatrick Macnee as John Steed (Series 1\u20136)\nIan Hendry as Dr David Keel (Series 1)\nHonor Blackman as Cathy Gale (Series 2\u20133)\nJon Rollason as Dr Martin King (Series 2)\nJulie Stevens as Venus Smith (Series 2)\nDiana Rigg as Emma Peel (Series 4\u20135)\nLinda Thorson as Tara King (Series 6)\n\nProduction\nMusic\nThe 1961 series featured a jazz-influenced theme by John Dankworth. Library music was used sparsely as a soundtrack, sometimes with variations based on the main theme. Dankworth's theme music was reworked for the third series. John Dankworth's first theme was recorded on the Columbia label, on a 45rpm single, and a new recording, similar to the reworked television theme was issued on Fontana in 1963. A very faithful cover version was released by Johnny Gregory.\nWhen Diana Rigg joined the series in 1965, the opening credits of the series were redesigned and new theme music by Laurie Johnson was introduced. This was based on a previously released title on LP, called \"The Shake\" (which capitalised on \"The Shake\" dance craze of the '60s). For the colour series (1967), a percussion section was added to accompany the new teaser sequence at the start of each episode. Laurie Johnson re-scored the theme when Linda Thorson joined the series, adding a counter-melody on trumpet, based on the leitmotif for Tara King from the final Diana Rigg episode \"The Forget-Me-Knot.\" The new theme debuted in the closing titles of the episode \"The Forget-Me-Knot,\" which introduced Linda Thorson. It was altogether more dynamic, and included a much more frenetic percussion section, for the revised teaser sequence. Importantly, the filmed episodes contained specially composed scores by Johnson. To accompany Steed's request, \"Mrs. Peel \u2013 we're needed!\", he composed a brief 'sting', and there was also a special theme for 'Emma'. For the 'Linda Thorson' series, a characteristic piece was composed to accompany the tag scene, at the end of each episode. Many of the most memorable cues from the Rigg\/Thorson series, including the opening, and closing titles themes, and the 'Tag Scene' were released commercially on CD in 2009.\nOwing to a professional commitment to score for the film Hot Millions (starring Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith), Laurie Johnson requested assistance from his keyboard player, Howard Blake, who scored some of the episodes of the final season, as well as additional music for other episodes which Laurie Johnson did not have time to complete. These were composed in a style remarkably similar to Laurie Johnson's. In 2011, to mark the 50th anniversary of the series, these almost-complete scores by Howard Blake\u2212including Laurie Johnson's themes for the main and end titles\u2014were issued on a double-CD set. Of the original Johnson theme, countless cover versions have been released on vinyl and CD, and the opening motif was retained on the series The New Avengers.\nLaurie Johnson subsequently collaborated with Brian Clemens on other projects, including the theme for The New Avengers.\n\nCars\nThe cars used in the series became almost as famous as the actors. From the 4th series on, Steed's signature cars were six vintage, green 1926\u20131928 Bentley racing or town cars, including Blower Bentleys and Bentley Speed Sixes (although, uniquely, in \"The Thirteenth Hole\" he drives a Vauxhall 30-98). In the final series, he drove two yellow Rolls-Royces \u2013 a 1923 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost and a 1927 Rolls-Royce New Phantom. Peel drove Lotus Elan convertibles (a white 1964 and a powder blue 1966), which, like her clothes, emphasised her independence and vitality. During the first Peel series (Series 4), each episode ended with a short, humorous scene of the duo leaving the scene of their most recent adventure in some unusual vehicle.  Mother occasionally appeared in a silver Rolls-Royce. Tara King drove an AC 428 and a Lotus Europa. Lady Diana Forbes Blakeney drove an MGC Roadster.\n\nProduction team\nSydney Newman, who would later go on to spearhead the creation of Doctor Who for the BBC, never received screen credit as the creator of The Avengers. In his memoir, The Avengers and Me, Patrick Macnee interviewed Newman about this. Newman explained that he never sought on-screen credit on the series because during his previous tenure at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, such credits were not given, and he never thought to get one for The Avengers.\nThe production team changed during the series' long run, particularly between the third and fourth series, but the influence of Brian Clemens was felt throughout. He wrote the second episode and became the series' most prolific scriptwriter. Succeeding producers Leonard White and John Bryce, Julian Wintle became the producer of the 4th series with Brian Clemens credited as associate producer and Albert Fennell credited as \"In charge of production\". For series 5, made by A.B.C. Television Films (which was created during the run-up to ABC Weekend TV and Associated-Rediffusion forming Thames TV) Clemens and Fennell became co-producers, with Wintle as executive producer. For series 6, after its initial producer John Bryce left, Clemens and Fennell returned as co-producers; early episodes also credit Julian Wintle as consultant to the series and Philip Levene as story consultant.\nRay Austin became the fight arranger for series 4 and 5, introducing kung fu to the series. Ray Austin had been training with Chee Soo and they worked techniques from Feng Shou kung fu and tai chi into the fight scenes and credit sequences. Ray Austin, Diana Rigg and Chee Soo were later awarded a Guinness world record as the first people to show kung fu on television. Later he became a prolific television director. Joe Dunne took over for series 6.\n\nEpisodes\nSix series of The Avengers were made between 1961 and 1969. There was an enforced break in filming and transmission towards the end of series five due to financial problems. Television researcher Andrew Pixley and authors Paul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping in their book The Avengers Dossier: The Unauthorised and Unofficial Guide consider the last eight episodes produced after the break as constituting a short series six, and therefore count seven series in total. Within the internal production of The Avengers the last eight episodes were considered to be a continuation of series five.\n\nReception\nIn Canada and the United States\nAlthough telerecordings of the second and third series were seen in Canada as early as 1963, the first two series of The Avengers were not broadcast on television in the United States. The American ABC purchased the rights to broadcast seasons 4 and 5 in the United States in 1965. The sale of The Avengers to United States television prompted a change in production style from the 405-line British multi-camera stand to the single-camera shooting method, originated on 35mm film.\nThe series' stunt man and stunt arranger Ray Austin expressed the opinion that the show's violence ultimately harmed its popular success in the United States. There The Avengers was given a late timeslot due to its violence: \"They did that with the first Avengers here [in the U.S.], with Diana Rigg. They put us on at 11:30 pm on CBS  [sic], because it was too violent\". Austin goes on to explain that US television follows a \"different code\". Austin said that on The Avengers \"we were determined to do the show our way, the English way, and no one was going to stop us! And, indeed, no one did stop us. We never, never got to prime time. And it was our own faults, because we would not comply to the Midwest. That's where the money comes from in this country, nowhere else. Forget Los Angeles, forget New York\u2014you have to aim for the Midwest. If the Midwest watches your show, you've made it\". In fact the first and second series of Emma Peel episodes mainly aired at 10:00 pm on ABC. The final Rigg episodes and all the Linda Thorson episodes mainly ran at 7:30 pm, also on ABC.\nAmerican censors objected to some content, in particular the episode \"A Touch of Brimstone\", which featured a modern-day version of the Hellfire Club and climaxed with Emma being dressed in a skimpy corset costume with spiked collar and high-heeled boots to become the Queen of Sin, and being attacked with a whip by guest star Peter Wyngarde. The American broadcast network refused to air it. In total five episodes from the first Emma Peel series were not initially broadcast by ABC. These were: \"A Surfeit of H2O\", \"Silent Dust\" (which featured Emma being attacked with a horsewhip), \"Quick-Quick Slow Death\", \"A Touch of Brimstone\" and \"Honey for the Prince\" (in which Emma performed the dance of the seven veils), although they were seen in later syndicated repeats.\nEarlier Cathy Gale and Venus Smith episodes had aired in Canada before the arrival of Mrs. Peel. US audiences saw the 1962\u20131964 Gale and Smith episodes of the series for the first time in the early 1990s when they were broadcast on the A&E Network. No Keel episode of the series was ever repeatedly broadcast outside Britain, contributing to the fact nearly all first-series episodes are now lost, and even in the UK only one surviving episode, \"The Frighteners\", was rebroadcast (as part of a run of classic episodes on Channel 4 in early 1993, otherwise mostly consisting of Gale episodes).\n\nHome media\nOnly three complete episodes from the show's first series, plus a portion of another episode, are known to exist, as 16mm film telerecordings. These are \"The Frighteners\" (an extract of which is playing on a television in the film Quadrophenia), \"Girl on the Trapeze\", which was found in the UCLA Film and Television Archive via an internet search of their on-line database, and \"Tunnel of Fear\", which was found in 2016. Additionally, part of the show's first episode was also found in the United States. The footage is of the episode's first 21 minutes, up to the first commercial break.\nAll series 2 and series 3 episodes survive as 16mm telerecordings. These have been released to DVD, as have all of the Emma Peel and Tara King episodes, which were shot on film. The two earlier-found surviving complete Keel episodes, plus the remnant of the first episode, have also been released in the UK and US, but are not currently available in the US. None of the original videotapes of series 1, 2 and 3 survive.\nFrom the late 1990s to the early 2000s, A&E TV Home Entertainment (under license from Canal+ Image International) released the remaining surviving series on Region 1 DVD in North America, with newly remastered picture and sound quality.\nSeries 4, 5 and 6 were remastered and released on Blu-ray by Studio Canal.\n\nSequel\nThe New Avengers\nThe sustained popularity of the Tara King episodes in France led to a 1975 French television advertisement for Laurent-Perrier champagne, in which Thorson and Macnee reprised their roles. The advertisement's success spurred financing interest in France for new episodes of The Avengers.\nThe result was a new series, The New Avengers. Patrick Macnee reprised the role of Steed, with two new partners, Mike Gambit (Gareth Hunt) and Purdey (Joanna Lumley). It aired on ITV in the UK in 1976\u20131977, CTV in Canada, CBS in the United States (in 1978\u201379) and TF1 in France (series 1 in 1976\u20131977 and series 2 in 1979). The final four episodes were almost completely produced by Canadian interests and were filmed there. In some markets they carried the title The New Avengers in Canada.\nAlthough Macnee was the only actor from the original series to reprise his role, archival footage of Diana Rigg allowed Emma Peel to make a cameo appearance in a second-season episode \"K is for Kill: The Tiger Awakes\", while Macnee's first co-star, Ian Hendry, made a guest appearance as a different character in the episode \"To Catch a Rat\".\n\nSpin-offs\nNovels\nA number of original novels based on the series were published in the 1960s. The first by Douglas Enefer, published by Consul Books, was the only 60s novel to feature Cathy Gale. Panther Books published four novels written by John Garforth featuring Emma Peel in the United Kingdom in 1967; Berkley Medallion Books reprinted these in the United States. After Panther stopped publishing Avengers novels in the UK, Berkley Medallion continued publishing original novels of their own: one featuring Peel and four featuring Tara King for the US market only; three by Keith Laumer in 1968; and two by Norman Daniels 1968\/69. Berkley Medallion later re-printed all nine novels with new covers that featured photos of both Rigg and Thorson, regardless of which Avengers girl appeared in the novel. The two novels published by Hodder and Stoughton in 1965\/66 were co-written by Patrick Macnee, making him one of the first actors to write licensed spin-off fiction of their own shows. The Macnee novels, Deadline and Dead Duck, were reprinted in the UK by Titan Books in standard paperback in 1994 and in France by Huitieme Art (1995 & 1996). They were also published in the US for the first time by TV Books in 1998. Titan reissued the books in trade paperback format (with the same covers) to coincide with the release of the 1998 feature film.\nThe 1990 novel Too Many Targets by John Peel featured all of Steed's partners (David Keel, Cathy Gale, Emma Peel and Tara King) with the exception of Venus Smith and Dr Martin King.\n\nThe Avengers, Douglas Enefer, 1963\nDeadline, Patrick Macnee and Peter Leslie, 1965\nDead Duck, Macnee and Leslie, 1966\nThe Floating Game, John Garforth, 1967\nThe Laugh Was on Lazarus, Garforth, 1967\nThe Passing of Gloria Munday, Garforth, 1967\nHeil Harris!, Garforth, 1967\nThe Afrit Affair, Keith Laumer, 1968\nThe Drowned Queen, Laumer, 1968\nThe Gold Bomb, Laumer, 1968\nThe Magnetic Man, Norman A.

Both of the Macnee\/Leslie UK paperback titles were translated and published in Portugal in 1967 as Os Vingadores: O Dia Depois De Amanha (Deadline) and Os Vingadores: O Pato Morto (Dead Duck) by Deaga. All four UK John Garforth Panther book paperbacks were translated and published by Roman in France (1967), a paperback omnibus edition was published in 1998 by Fleuve Noir. Three of the Garforth paperbacks were also translated and published by Heyne in Germany (1967\/68) (Heil Harris! was not translated for obvious reasons) and a German hardback omnibus edition of the three titles was published by Lichtenberg (1968), reprinted in paperback by Heyne in 1998. All four titles were also translated and published in the Netherlands by Bruna (1967) and in Chile by Zig-Zag (1968).\n\nComics\nThe first UK Avengers comic strips, featuring Steed and Cathy Gale, first appeared in regional TV listings magazines Look Westward and The Viewer from 14 September 1963 to 9 May 1964 (and later in 1964, re-printed in the Manchester Evening News). This run consisted of four serials.\nSteed and Mrs Peel comic strips began in Polystyle Publications' TV Comic in issue #720, dated 2 October 1965, beginning after the TV debut of Emma Peel, and ran until issue #771, dated 24 September 1966 \u2013 this run consisted of 10 serials plus one 4-page one-off in TV Comic Holiday Special (June 1966). At that point the rights were sold to publishers D.C. Thomson & Co. Ltd, where the next version of the strip appeared in issue #199, dated 10 December 1966, of Diana the popular paper for girls. Its run ended in issue #224, dated 2 June 1967, with art by Emilio Frejo and Juan Gonzalez Alacrojo \u2013 this run consisted of 8 serials.\nEarlier, The Growing Up of Emma Peel comic strip had appeared in June and Schoolfriend comic from issue #52, dated 29 January 1966, to issue #63, dated 16 April 1966. This had featured the adventures of 14-year-old Emma Knight and was run concurrent with the TV Comic strip and consisted of 11 instalments.\nThe Avengers returned to TV Comic issue #877, dated 5 October 1968, just after Tara King debuted on TV, the Tara & Steed strip continued until issue #1077, dated 5 August 1972. This run consisted of 28 serials plus a 4-page one-off in TV Comic Holiday Special 1972. Also in 1966 Thorpe & Porter published a 68-page Avengers comic featuring Steed & Peel, with original art by Mick Anglo and Mick Austin \u2014 this consisted of four 16-page stories.\nA few Avengers-related comic books have been published in the USA. They are not named The Avengers because the rights to the names \"Avengers\" and \"New Avengers\" are held by Marvel Comics for use with their Avengers comics depicting a team of superheroes called The Avengers. Gold Key Comics published one issue of John Steed Emma Peel in 1968 (subtitled The Avengers on the Indicia page), which included two newly coloured and reformatted The Avengers strips from TV Comic.\nA 3-issue limited entitled Steed and Mrs. Peel appeared in 1990\u20131992 under the Acme Press\/Eclipse Comics imprint; it featured a three-part story, \"The Golden Game\" in issues #1\u20133, by Grant Morrison and a two-part story, in issues #2 & #3, \"A Deadly Rainbow\" by Anne Caulfield; both strips had art by Ian Gibson. Boom! Studios reprinted this series in six issues in early 2012, and later published a new ongoing series written by Mark Waid and Caleb Monroe which lasted 12 issues. Boom! subsequently announced a six-issue follow-up series, Steed and Mrs. Peel: We're Needed, which was launched in the summer of 2014. Despite issue #1 showing \"1 of 6\", only 3 issues were produced (\"2 of 3\" and \"3 of 3\" showing on the other issues, with the cover for issue #3 being the one originally planned for issue #4 which was planned to be the start of another 3-issue story).\nIn the UK, where hardback annuals are traditionally produced for sale at Christmas, The Avengers first appeared in TV Crimebusters Annual (1962) and featured a 7-page comic strip with Dr David Keel titled The Drug Pedlar. Atlas Publications produced three The Avengers hardback Annuals for 1967, 1968 and 1969, which also featured original Avengers comic strips featuring Steed, Emma Peel, and Tara King, as well as text stories.\nThe TV Comic Avengers strips and the 1966 Avengers comic and a few comic strips from the Annuals have been translated and published in Germany, the Netherlands, France, and Chile.\nThe Avengers also have made a number of cameo appearances in comics over the years:\n\nIn 1991's Doctor Who Magazine #173, Gary Russell and artists Mike Collins and Steve Pini show Captain Britain about to hit John Steed when Emma Peel shows up behind him.\nEmma Peel and John Steed were seen among the crowd in a bar scene in Kingdom Come #2 (1996) by Mark Waid and Alex Ross.\nEmma Peel and John Steed appeared unnamed in Superman #13 (1988) by John Byrne and Karl Kesel.\nA crossover series, Batman '66 Meets Steed and Mrs. Peel, was launched in June 2016 as a joint effort between DC Comics and Boom! Studios.\nAlan Moore's League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is littered with oblique references to events and characters in The Avengers, with three unnamed characters that are clearly Purdey, Tara and Emma appearing at the end of the book \"Century: 2009\".\n\nStage play\nA stage adaptation was produced in Britain in 1971, written by TV series veterans Brian Clemens and Terence Feely, and directed by Leslie Phillips. It starred Simon Oates as Steed, Sue Lloyd as new partner Hannah Wild, and Kate O'Mara as villainess Madame Gerda. All three had guest roles in the original series.\nA character named Hana Wilde (played by Charlotte Rampling) had essentially acted as Steed's partner in series five's \"The Superlative Seven\", an episode in which Emma Peel appears only briefly. According to John Peel in his overview of \"The Superlative Seven\", Charlotte Rampling was rumoured to be grooming up to replace Diana Rigg in this story, but nothing ever came of that\".\n\nRadio series\nA radio series was transmitted between 6 December 1971 and 28 December 1973 on Springbok Radio, the English-language service of the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC); it was recorded at Sonovision Studios in Johannesburg, produced by Dave Gooden, the original TV scripts were adapted and directed by Tony Jay, for the first six months and Dennis Folbigge for the remainder. South Africa did not have national television until 1976. The episodes were adapted from both Emma Peel and Tara King episodes (with Tara changed to Emma Peel throughout). The Avengers were played by two British expatriate actors, Donald Monat as Steed and Diane Appleby as Mrs Peel, with Hugh Rouse as the tongue-in-cheek narrator. The stories were adapted into five-episode serials under Tony Jay and six- and seven-episode serials under Dennis Folbigge, of approximately 15 minutes each (including adverts) and stripped across the week, Monday-Friday, on Springbok Radio.\nCurrently only 19 complete serials survive, all from reel-to-reel off-air recordings made by John Wright in 1972. Also, the first three episodes of a remake of Escape in Time currently exist. Episodes 1 and 2 are copies from the original Sonovision tapes, and episode 3 is from an off-air recording, on audio cassette, made by Barbara Peterson; the rest of this serial is still missing. These episodes are also known to have been transmitted in New York on station WBAI on 99.5 FM, from 1977 to the early 1990s, and are currently being transmitted on Miami station WRGP on early Monday mornings.\nCopies from the original off-air recordings have been restored by Alan and Alys Hayes, and can be heard at their \"The Avengers Declassified\" website and its sister website \"Avengers on the Radio\".\nMany more serials were broadcast during its two-year run on South African radio; it is thought 83 serials were made and transmitted, but no other episodes are known to exist at present.\n\nFilm\nPlans for a feature-length adaptation based upon the series circulated during the 1960s, 1980s and 1990s, with Mel Gibson at one point being considered a front-runner for the role of Steed. Ultimately, the 1998 film, starring Uma Thurman as Emma Peel and Ralph Fiennes as John Steed, with Sean Connery as the villain, received extremely negative reviews from critics and fans, and is a notorious commercial failure.\n\nAudio\nIn June 2013, Big Finish Productions signed a license with StudioCanal to produce full-cast audio productions of 12 lost first season episodes. The main cast includes Julian Wadham as Steed, Anthony Howell as Dr David Keel, and Lucy Briggs-Owen as Carol Wilson. The stories are adapted for audio by John Dorney.\nIn January 2014, Volume One, containing the first four stories, (\"Hot Snow\", \"Brought to Book\", \"Square Root of Evil\" and \"One for the Mortuary\") was released. Volume Two, containing the next four stories, (\"Ashes of Roses\", \"Please Don't Feed the Animals\", \"The Radioactive Man\" and \"Dance with Death\") was released in July 2014. Volume Three, containing the next four stories, was released in January 2015.\nIn March 2014, Big Finish extended the audio recreation programme to include all 26 season one episodes, including the then-two extant stories. A total of seven boxed sets were released.\n\nProposed reboots\nIn a 2023 interview, Charlie Higson said he and Paul Whitehouse had been offered an opportunity to helm a new series, but had declined.\nOn 18 January 2024, it was announced that Mickey Down and Konrad Kay were developing a reboot for StudioCanal.\n\nSee also\nList of The Avengers and The New Avengers cast members\nAvengerland, a variant of Metro-land\nHoney West\nThe Saint\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nThe Avengers by Dave Rogers (ITV Books in association with Michael Joseph Ltd., 1983)\nThe Avengers Anew by Dave Rogers (Michael Joseph Ltd., 1985)\nThe Complete Avengers by Dave Rogers (Boxtree Ltd., in Great Britain, 1989; St. Martin's Press, in America, 1989)\nThe Ultimate Avengers by Dave Rogers (Boxtree Ltd., in Great Britain, 1995)\nThe Avengers and Me by Patrick Macnee and Dave Rogers (New York: TV Books, 1997).\nThe Avengers Companion by Alain Carraz\u00e9 and Jean-Luc Putheaud, with Alex J.

When episodes began, Sam Brennan owned a newspaper for which Dion Patrick worked as a reporter. Patrick also sought to maintain law and order as a member of a group  of vigilantes headed by storekeeper Jack McGivern.\nBecause the program's sponsors \"were uneasy about glorifying vigilantes\", the producers changed the characters and cast. In March 1958 Matthew Wayne came to San Francisco. He bought a saloon and soon was elected as the city's sheriff. Wayne became the main character, with McGivern and Patrick being phased out.\nThe second season began with Wayne as the city marshal, whose efforts were supported by a police department of 50 people. New characters in that season were Wilma Fansler, a widowed young operator of a gambling establishment, and Jeremy Pitt, an attorney who was \"friend and foil to the marshal\".\n\nCast\nDion Patrick - Adam Kennedy\nJack McGivern - Sean McClory\nMartha McGivern - Nan Leslie\nSam Brennan - Herbert Rudley\nMatthew Wayne - Richard Coogan\nSchaab - Howard Caine\nWilma Fansler - Carole Mathews\nJeremy Pitt - Art Fleming\n\nGuest stars\nEpisode list\nSeason 1: 1957\u201358\nSeason 2: 1958\u201359\nProduction\nProducer Louis F.

Felix Feist replaced him in January 1958. The Californians initially was broadcast on Tuesdays from 10 to 10:30 p.m. Eastern Time. In April 1959 it was moved to 9 - 9:30 p.m. E. T. on Tuesdays, and in July 1959 it was moved to Thursdays from 7:30 to 8 p.m. E. T.\nThe Californians theme song, \"I've Come to California\", was sung by the Ken Darby Singers. Darby also scored the program.\nThe Californians had competition from The West Point Story, which was broadcast by the American Broadcasting Company, and The $64,000 Question by CBS. In its second season, the western competed with The Garry Moore Show on CBS and the crime\/police reality show Confession, hosted by Jack Wyatt, on ABC.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nThe Californians at IMDb","105":"The Cowboys  is an American Western television series based on the 1972 motion picture of the same name. It aired on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) television network from February 6 to May 8, 1974. The series starred Jim Davis, Diana Douglas, Moses Gunn, A Martinez, Robert Carradine and Clay O'Brien. David Dortort produced the series. The television show followed the exploits of seven boys who worked on a ranch in 1870s New Mexico.\nThe Cowboys was conceived as an hour-long series, but ABC decided to reduce the running time to a half-hour format. The format change did not lead to increased viewers, and the show was the victim of early cancellation. As a traditional television Western, it was an aberration compared to most television trends of the 1970s (as most had ended production several years prior, and only Gunsmoke was still in production by then).\nGuest stars included Cal Bellini as Wa-Cha-Ka in \"The Indian Givers\", Kevin Hagen as Josh Redding in \"Death on a Fast Horse\", and Lurene Tuttle as Grandma Jesse in \"Many a Good Horse Died\".\n\nCast\nDiana Douglas as Annie Andersen\nJim Davis as Marshal Bill Winter\nMoses Gunn as Jebediah Nightlinger\nA Martinez as Cimarron (Cowboy)\nRobert Carradine as Slim (Cowboy)\nSean Kelly as Jimmy (Cowboy)\nKerry MacLane as Homer (Cowboy)\nClint Howard as Steve (Cowboy)\nMitch Brown as Hardy (Cowboy)\nClay O'Brien as Weedy (Cowboy)\n\nGuest stars\nEach guest star made only one appearance.\n\nTed Gehring as Eben Graff\nDeForest Kelley as Jack Potter\nCal Bellini as Wa-Cha-Ka\nKevin Hagen as Josh Redding\nLurene Tuttle as Grandma Jesse\nStafford Repp as Army Captain\nIan Wolfe as Padre\nJohn McKee as Foley\nWalter Brooke as Reager\nJohn Carradine as Oscar Schmidt\nJack Perkins\nPippa Scott as Chief\n\nEpisodes\nThe following is a list of episodes.\n\nExternal links\nThe Cowboys at IMDb","106":"The Forest Rangers is a Canadian television series that ran from 1963 to 1965.

Early episodes of the series were broadcast in serialized form as part of a CBC children's series entitled Razzle Dazzle, hosted by Alan Hamel and Michelle Finney.\nThis was the first appearance in a major series by Gordon Pinsent. He left the series in 1965 to star in Quentin Durgens, M.P.. In 1966 the series was adapted into a comic strip by British comics artist John Gillatt, which appeared in the British comic magazine Tiger.\nThe show was also run in syndication in the United States from 1965 to 1966.\nIn June 2004, there was a reunion for ex-cast and fans just south of Kleinburg, where the show was originally filmed.

The series was produced by Herb Klynn and Jules Engel of Format Films, Hollywood, and designed and made at the Halas and Batchelor Cartoon Film studios in London, England & Artransa Park Film Studios in Australia.\nIn 1980, Filmation produced another Lone Ranger cartoon series.\n\nOverview\nThe adventures in this Lone Ranger series were similar in tone and nature to CBS' prime-time Weird Western, The Wild Wild West, in that some of the plots were bizarre and had elements of science fiction and steampunk technology included in the story. One of the Lone Ranger's archenemies in the animated series was a dwarf named Tiny Tom and his giant henchman named Goliath; an analogue to The Wild Wild West's Dr. Miguelito Loveless and his giant companion Voltaire. Other supervillain-style foes in the series included the Fly, the Frog People, the Black Widow, the Queen Bee, the Iron Giant, Mephisto, Mr. Happy, Mr. Midas, the Rainmaker and Shandarr the Puppetmaster.\n\nCast\nMichael Rye \u2014 Lone Ranger\nShepard Menken \u2014 Tonto\nDick Beals \u2014 Tiny Tom\nAgnes Moorehead \u2014 The Black Widow\nHans Conried \u2014 Mephisto\nPaul Winchell \u2014 The Rainmaker\n\nProduction\nThe Lone Ranger's voice was provided by Michael Rye {r.n. John Michael Riorden Billsbury}, and Shepard Menken provided that of Tonto. The narrator in the opening titles was Marvin Miller, whose narration ran:\n\nWhen the factories first began to send their pall of smoke over the cities, and farmlands of the East offered only the barest living, Americans turned their faces toward the West. They poured into the new territory by the thousands--fording the mighty rivers, climbing the mountains, fighting Indians and outlaws--praying...toiling...dying.\nIt was a hard land, a hostile land. Only the strong survived...a new American breed--the pioneer.\nIn this forge upon this anvil was hammered out a man who became a legend...a daring and resourceful man who hated thievery and oppression.\nHis face masked...his true name unknown...with his faithful Indian companion at his side, he thundered across the West on his great white stallion, appearing out of nowhere to strike down injustice and outlawry...and then, vanishing as mysteriously as he came.\nHis sign: a silver bullet.\n\nHis name: The Lone Ranger!!!\nOther guest voices were provided by Paul Winchell, Agnes Moorehead, and Hans Conried.\nThe animation was limited. But the backgrounds had a dark style, with blocks of color elided from the line, which visually set the show apart from many other cartoon TV series of the time. The distinct atmospheric music was composed by Vic Schoen, who also provided the powerful arrangement of Gioachino Rossini's William Tell Overture for the show's memorable opening sequence. Along with the Halas and Batchelor animators, the background department, led by Tom Bailey, Ted Petengel and designer Chris Miles, were responsible for setting the graphic style. The drawings were produced by chinagraph pencil on cell. Colored papers were cut or torn under or against the lines of the background, producing a dramatic and rich textural effect.\n\nList of episodes\nReferences\nExternal links\nThe Lone Ranger at IMDb\nLone Ranger Fanclub Archived 2016-01-13 at the Wayback Machine\nDescription at Pazaz Entertainment","108":"The fourth and final season of The O.C., an American teen drama television series, aired in the United States from November 2, 2006, to February 22, 2007, and consisted of 16 episodes. The O.C's final season aired Thursdays at 9:00 p.m. ET in the United States on Fox, a terrestrial television network. Fox tested a new timeslot by airing the second episode on Wednesday at 9:00 p.m. ET against ABC's Lost and CBS's Criminal Minds. With Lost about to enter a three-month hiatus, Fox hoped that changing the timeslot for The O.C. would attract back viewers it had lost since the end of the previous season; however, the move was unsuccessful and the show returned to its Thursday timeslot.\nThe season was released on DVD as a five-disc boxed set under the title The O.C.: The Complete Fourth Season on May 22, 2007, by Warner Home Video. The season was also made available in the American versions of Zune and iTunes Store. Before the season premiered on television, it was available through on demand streaming. In the US, streaming was available from October 26, 2006, at 3:01 a.m. ET onwards, through Fox Interactive Media's MySpace and MyFoxLocal stations.\nIn Canada, the fourth season was simulcast on the terrestrial CTV Television Network. Additionally, as a result of an agreement between Warner Bros. Television and CTV, the first episode was available to be streamed from October 30, 2006, at 12:00 p.m. ET onwards, through the CTV Broadband Network. In the United Kingdom the season premiered on January 9, 2007, on E4, and in Australia it was broadcast by Network Ten on November 7, 2006, at 8:30 p.m. (local time).\n\nSynopsis\nLife after high school hasn't been great for the graduates of Harbor high. Ryan, Julie, and Summer have trouble adjusting to life without Marissa. Taylor ran into some trouble. Back in Newport for her Junior year, Kaitlin begins to act out. Sandy and Kirsten face another bombshell life puts in their lap or oven. Seth tries to find his calling. Ryan gets an unexpected visitor who helps Julie out of her grief.\n\nCast and characters\nEpisodes\nNotes\n^\u2020  - The second episode was shown first in Canada on Tuesday, November 7 at 8:00 p.m. ET on CTV. In the United States the episode aired the next day at 9:00 p.m. ET.\n\nCrew\nThe season was produced by Warner Bros. Television, College Hill Pictures and Wonderland Sound and Vision. The executive producers were Bob DeLaurentis, creator Josh Schwartz and Wonderland co-founders McG and Stephanie Savage. Ian Toynton and John Stephens served as co-executive producers. The staff writers were Schwartz, Savage, Stephens, J.J. Philbin, Leila Gerstein and Mark Fish. The regular directors throughout the season were Toynton, Michael Lange, Norman Buckley and Patrick Norris.\n\nCast\nThe fourth season had star billing for eight major roles. Rachel Bilson as Summer, Adam Brody as Seth, Melinda Clarke as Julie, Peter Gallagher as Sandy, Benjamin McKenzie as Ryan, and Kelly Rowan as Kirsten all returned to the main cast. Former main cast member Mischa Barton did not return because her character, Marissa, died in the third season finale. Autumn Reeser as recent high school graduate Taylor Townsend, and Willa Holland as Marissa's younger sister Kaitlin both joined the main cast, having previously held recurring roles. Other cast members returning in recurring roles include Cam Gigandet as Volchok, Erin Foster as Heather, Michael Nouri as Summer's father Dr. Neil Roberts, Paula Trickey as Taylor's mother Veronica, and Ashley Hartman who starred as Holly Fischer in the first season. Additionally former main cast member Tate Donovan returned as Jimmy Cooper in a non-canonical appearance.\nActors who left the cast include Ryan Donowho (Johnny), Jeri Ryan (Charlotte), Shaun Duke (Henry Griffin), Kayla Ewell (Casey), and Nikki Reed (Sadie). New members who joined the cast include Kevin Sorbo as Ryan's father Frank; Gary Grubbs as an oil merchant who calls himself The Bullit; Brandon Quinn as Bullit's son Spencer; Chris Pratt as an environmental activist nicknamed Che; and Wayne Dalglish and Corey Price as Luke Ward's younger twin brothers Brad and Eric. New guest stars who joined in recurring roles include Tia Carrere as Dean Torres, singer Chris Brown as lonely band geek Will Tutt, Henri Lubatti as Taylor's ex-husband Henri-Michel de Momourant, and Steve-O in a cameo role as an unnamed marine.\n\nReception\nWhile ratings were lower than those of the third season, the final season is generally regarded by fans and critics as an improvement on the third. Variety's Josef Adalian said that \"[the show] is once again in great creative shape\". He added that \"the scripts are snappy, the plots make sense, the acting's solid, [and] the music is appropriately indie\" but criticized Fox for \"throwing away\" the show by giving it the Thursday 9:00 p.m. timeslot. The difficult timeslot Adalian was referring to was against two other very popular shows, CSI and Grey's Anatomy. With a later start to the season in November the premiere attracted 3.4 million viewers,\nwhich was a series low and marked a 55 percent decrease in the 18\u201349 demographic, from the third season premiere. The first half of the season averaged 4.06 million viewers, with the season as a whole averaging 4.6 million viewers. This increase was mostly due to 6.7 million viewers, 76 percent more than the season average, tuning in to see the final ever installment of The O.C.\nDue to a combination of low ratings and the death of Marissa in season three, it was rumored that the show would not return for a fifth season. In June 2006, Fox confirmed that \"the current order for The O.C. is 16 episodes\", but added that there was a chance to add more installments. In September 2006, Rachel Bilson said that she felt \"like the show is over\", and co-star Kelly Rowan stated that many of the cast realized the show was close to being cancelled. Rowan said that \"when [the fourth season] was picked up for just 16 episodes this year the cast had a feeling the end was near\".\nOn January 3, 2007, Fox announced that The O.C. was to be cancelled. In a statement, Schwartz said \"This feels like the best time to bring the show to its close\" adding that \"what better time to go out than creatively on top\". A campaign was launched to save the show and over half a million people signed an official petition at www.fox.com\/oc\/savetheoc. There were rumors that the show would be saved, and a move to The CW was mooted; however, The CW president Dawn Ostroff, whose company is partly owned by Warner Bros, confirmed in January 2007 that while the move was discussed, it was decided against.\nSchwartz said that the cancellation of the show \"was really creatively liberating, not worrying about ratings.\" Belinda Acosta of The Austin Chronicle agreed praising the show's \"new energy\" and its ability to successfully cover \"the transition between high school and college that other series have stumbled over\". Entertainment Weekly's Ken Tucker commented that the fourth season was \"a succession of terrific subplots\" and praised new main cast member Taylor \"as a fine, funny love interest for Ryan\". Greg Elwell of DVD Talk described Bullit as \"the breakout character of the season\" but commented that the seasons \"dark opening (...) didn't do much to keep viewers around\". IGN's Eric Goldman was also critical saying that \"as amusing as Che was, his inclusion into some later episodes gets a bit tired\". Goldman also commented that \"the second half of Season 4 wasn't quite as solid as the first [half]\"; however, he added that while the fourth season had to prove itself again as an enjoyable watch \"Josh Schwartz rose to this challenge (...) once again creating a show that was witty and self-aware\".\n\nDVD release\nThe DVD release of season four was released by Warner Bros. in the US on 22 May 2007 after it had completed broadcast on television. As well as every episode from the season, the DVD release features bonus material including unaired scenes, featurettes, and audio commentary on the series finale.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nEpisode guide at Warner Bros.' The OC Insider\nThe O.C. at IMDb","109":"Trackdown is an American Western television series starring Robert Culp that aired on CBS between 1957 and 1959. The series was produced by Dick Powell's Four Star Television and filmed at the Desilu-Culver Studio. Trackdown was a spin-off of Powell's anthology series, Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre.\n\nOverview\nTrackdown stars Robert Culp as Texas Ranger Hoby Gilman. It is set in the 1870s after the American Civil War. In early episodes, stories focused on Gilman going to different Texas towns in pursuit of wanted fugitives. At midseason, the series became set in the town of Porter, Texas. Episodes touched on multiple Western themes and topics, so it was known as \"the thinking man's Western\".\nGilman is the de facto sheriff in Porter. His friends in the town include Henrietta Porter (portrayed by Ellen Corby). She is the widow of the town's founder and owns The Porter Enterprise newspaper. Occasionally, Gilman's duties as a Texas Ranger took him out of town, where he used his fast gun to \"track down\" and apprehend wanted criminals throughout the Lone Star State.\nThe pilot episode, \"Badge of Honor\", directed by Arthur Hiller, aired on Zane Grey Theatre on May 3, 1957. Gilman, then an ex-Confederate cavalry officer, returns to his Central Texas hometown, called \"Crawford\", after the war. He finds the town under the  control of a ruthless gang led by an ex-Confederate colonel, Boyd Nelson (played by Gary Merrill). The town sheriff (portrayed by Tom Tully) is a drunken shell of a man Gilman had once known, who is afraid to face the outlaws. When a Texas Ranger came to arrest Colonel Nelson, he is fatally shot in the back. His Ranger badge falls on the dusty road. Gilman, who previously had served with the Texas Rangers, was weary of the Civil War and did not want to continue as a lawman, but after learning of the Ranger's death, he picks up the badge and finishes the job of bringing Nelson and his gang to justice.\nTrackdown carried the endorsement of both the State of Texas and the Texas Rangers, an accolade no other Western television series has received. Some episodes were inspired by the files of the Rangers.\n\nEpisodes\nSeason 1: 1957\u201358\nSeason 2: 1958\u201359\nBackground and production\nDevelopment\nAll Trackdown episodes were produced by Vincent Fennelly. John Robinson wrote 14 segments, including the pilot. Richard Donner was one of the directors. Sam Peckinpah wrote one episode, \"The Town\", about a cowardly community afraid to resist the clutches of an outlaw gang, but he did not direct any Trackdown episodes.\nRobert Culp wrote one episode, titled \"Back to Crawford\", which features his then-wife, Nancy Asch-Culp. The episode was directly related to the first regular series episode, \"The Marple Brothers\", as Nancy portrayed a former childhood friend of Hoby's, Merrilee Quintana, with whom Hoby was once in love, who was out to kill his sister Norah as revenge for his killing her young husband in the line of duty, and who was one of the evil Marple Brothers he encountered in Episode 1. Gilman's sister was played by actress Peggy Webber, reprising her role from the series pilot.\nIn an interview, Robert Culp stated that Trackdown was conceived by its creators as \"the Western Dragnet\". The pilot of the series was written by John Robinson, who, according to Culp in that same interview, was partly responsible for the creation of Dragnet.\nThe series narrator was character actor Ed Prentiss.\n\nGuest stars\nRelease\nSyndication\nFrom 2016 to 2020, episodes of Trackdown aired Saturday mornings on MeTV.\n\nCultural references\nThe episode, \"The End of the World\", received considerable media attention after Donald Trump was elected president of the United States in 2016, nearly 60 years after the episode first aired. In the episode, a rabble-rousing doomsayer named Walter Trump (played by Lawrence Dobkin) comes to town. He scares the townsfolk with talk of an impending disaster and claims to be the only person who can save them \u2013 by building a wall. He also threatens to sue Hoby when accused of dishonesty. By the end of the episode, he is arrested as a conman and fraud. The coincidental similarity to Donald Trump's name and proposed border wall was noted.\nA Vanity Fair author wrote, \"Of all the books and movies that presaged the rise of our reality-TV President... none are so eerily on the nose as this once-obscure, 1958 episode of Trackdown in which a demagogue named Trump attempts to convince a town that only he can save its citizens... by building a wall.\" The Wrap asked, \"Want to talk about a weird coincidence?.... Some may call this episode titled 'The End of the World' the ultimate illustration of life imitating art, considering the episode aired May 9, 1958... it is pretty amusing, especially when the TV character threatens, 'Be careful, son. I can sue you.'\" The San Francisco Chronicle stated, \"The character's speech is so similar to the President-elect's, it almost seems as if Donald Trump borrowed some catchphrases from Walter Trump.\"\n\nCritical response\nA review in the trade publication Variety described Trackdown as \"a moderately good western half-hour telefilm with a moderately good star performer\". The review complimented characterizations but said the plot \"was as loaded with holes as the villains were\".\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nTrackdown at IMDb","110":"Three ships of the United States Navy have borne the name Avenger.\n\nUSS Avenger (1863), was a side-wheel ram, transferred from the Army to the Navy in 1863, and decommissioned and sold in 1865.\nUSS Avenger (SP-2646), was leased and commissioned by the Navy in May 1918, and decommissioned in December 1918.\nUSS Avenger (MCM-1), is an Avenger-class mine countermeasures ship, launched in 1985 and decommissioned on 30 September 2014.\n\nFictional ships\nThe 1979 novel, Inoculate!, features a fictional submarine named USS Avenger\n\nSee also\nUSS Avenge\nHMS Avenger\n\nSources\n This article incorporates text from the public domain Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships.

They are set on the fantasy world of Orb. The reader takes the part of a young monk\/ninja, named Avenger, initially on a quest to avenge his foster father's murder and recover stolen scrolls. Later books presented other challenges for Avenger to overcome, most notably taking over and ruling a city.\nThe world of Orb was originally created by Mark Smith for a Dungeons & Dragons game he ran while a pupil at Brighton College in the mid-1970s. Orb was also used as the setting for the 1984 Fighting Fantasy gamebook Talisman of Death, and one of the settings in the 1985 Falcon gamebook Lost in Time, both by Smith and Thomson.\nEach book has a disclaimer at the front against performing any of the ninja related feats in the book as \"They could lead to serious injury or death to an untrained user\".\nThe sixth book, Inferno!, ends on a cliffhanger with Avenger trapped in the web of the Black Widow, Orb's darkest blight. As no new books were released, the fate of Avenger and Orb was unknown. Mark Smith has confirmed that the cliffhanger ending was deliberate.\nIn August 2013, the original creators of the series were working with Megara Entertainment to develop re-edited hardcover collector editions of the gamebooks (including a new prequel (Book 0) and sequel (book 7)), and potentially a role-playing game based on the series. The two new books plus the six re-edited original books were reprinted in paperback format  by Megara Entertainment in 2014, and made available as PDFs in 2019.\n\nBooks and publication history\nThe original series comprises six books:\n\nAvenger! (1985)\nAssassin! (1985)\nUsurper! (1985)\nOverlord! (1986)\nWarbringer! (1986)\nInferno! (1987)\nThe sixth book ended on a cliffhanger, which was not resolved until 27 years later. Interviewed in 2012, Mark Smith explained: \"Our publishers Hodder and Stoughton originally had signed for seven books but they cancelled the last in a fit of pique, which is why Inferno! ends so unsatisfactorily \u2013 they re-wrote the end themselves to kill the series. The story here is that the then CEO of Hodder, Eddie Bell, left to become CEO of Harper Collins ...

Avenger could also choose from a list of ninja skills such as Acrobatics or Poison Needle spitting, and used a variety of appropriate weaponry, such as a garotte and shuriken. Luck also played in part in the form of Fate tests to see if Fate smiled on you, or turned her back. Avenger could also enhance his skill by using \"Inner Force\", similar to qi energy.\nDuring the series Avenger could learn new skills, such as \"Shinren,\" a means of understanding people's intentions by observing subtle clues.\n\nCharacters\nThe books had a large number of opponents and recurring characters.\n\nEnemies\nTyutchev, Cassandra and Thaum \u2013 A trio of chaos worshippers, who revere the chaos god Anarchil.

It was the first hour-long, weekly scheduled dramatic series with continuing characters to last a full season on network television. However, the three reporters functioned independently of each other, meaning that the series was essentially three different ones sharing a time slot and title.\nThis program was aired at 9 p.m. (Eastern Time) Thursdays from September 1956 to February 1957, when it was moved to Mondays at 8:30. It was not renewed for a second season, and the last prime time broadcast under this title was in September 1957.  However, when a gap developed in the ABC schedule in February 1959, the episodes starring Dane Clark (only) were then rebroadcast under the title Deadline for Action. The last of these repeat episodes was broadcast on September 13, 1959.\nThe series sometimes delved into topics that were controversial for its era. They included profiteering, nuclear testing, and prison reform.\n\nCast\nDane Clark as Dan Miller\nGeorge Brent as Dean Evans\nMercedes McCambridge as Katherine Wells\n\nEpisodes\nProduction\nThe producers were Don Sharpe and Warren Lewis.

The White Eagles fought in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina during the Yugoslav Wars.\nIn the 2003 Vojislav \u0160e\u0161elj indictment from the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the group is included as an alleged party in a joint criminal enterprise of ethnic cleansing, in which SRS leader \u0160e\u0161elj allegedly took part. In the indictment the group is identified as \"volunteer units including 'Chetniks', or \u0160e\u0161eljevci\" (Serbian Cyrillic: \u0428\u0435\u0448\u0435\u0459\u0435\u0432\u0446\u0438). This association was denied by \u0160e\u0161elj. On 31 March 2016, he was acquitted in a first-instance verdict on all counts by the ICTY, a ruling which still holds today, barring an unrelated conviction from its successor (International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals) for instigating deportation of Croats from the Serbian village of Hrtkovci.\n\nName\nAlthough the group's members were occasionally referred to as Chetniks,  The name White Eagles comes from an anti-communist organisation that was formed during World War II and continued a guerrilla war against Tito's government after the war.  White Eagle refers to the national symbol of Serbia, the double headed white eagle under a crown.\n\nHistory\nThe White Eagles paramilitary group was formed in late 1990 by Dragoslav Bokan and Mirko Jovi\u0107. The group split into different factions as Bokan and Jovi\u0107 went their separate ways in 1992. Jovi\u0107 called for \"a Christian, Orthodox Serbia with no Muslims and no unbelievers\".\n\u0160e\u0161elj states that the group was started by Jovi\u0107 but they got out of his control. According to \u0160e\u0161elj, the White Eagles and Arkan's Tigers operated with help from the Yugoslav counterintelligence service.\n\nWar crimes\nParamilitary units are responsible for some of the most brutal aspects of \"ethnic cleansing\". Two of the units that have played a major role in the \"ethnic cleansing\" campaign in BiH, the \"Cetniks\" associated with Vojislav \u0160e\u0161elj and the \"Tigers\" associated with \u017deljko Ra\u017enatovi\u0107 (Arkan), have been active in the Republic of Serbia as well. Seselj's followers have reportedly waged \"ethnic cleansing\" campaigns against ethnic minorities in Serbia's provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo.\nTestimony at the International War Crimes Tribunal indicates that the White Eagles were responsible for a number of atrocities during the Croatian and Bosnian wars, including: the Vo\u0107in massacre, Vi\u0161egrad massacre, crimes at Fo\u010da, Gacko and others. Various members of the White Eagles were indicted by the Tribunal. Mitar Vasiljevi\u0107 received a fifteen-year sentence. Former head, Milan Luki\u0107, received a life sentence for his war crimes which include murdering men, women and children. It has been also reported that White Eagles managed a detention camp in Lije\u0161\u0107e, near Bosanski Brod.\n\nReappearance\nIn December 2010 a group called \"White Eagles\" (Serbian: \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u041e\u0440\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438 \/ Beli Orlovi) took responsibility for the killing of Kosovo's Bosniak leader \u0160efko Salkovi\u0107 in the north of Kosovo.

The first, The Way of the Tiger, is a beat 'em up released by Gremlin Graphics for the Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, MSX, Commodore 16 and Commodore 64. This game has Avenger fighting with staves and swords as well as utilizing unarmed combat (Avenger rarely used weapons apart from shuriken in the books).\nWay of the Tiger II: Avenger is an action-adventure made by Gremlin Graphics in 1986, for the computers Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum and MSX. In the game's story, Yaemon the Grand Master of Flame has killed the player's foster-father Naijish and stolen the Scrolls of Kettsuin. To recover the scrolls, the player has to find enough keys to penetrate the Quench Heart Keep, and then kill each of the three guards. The game is viewed from top-down perspective  and superficially resembles Gauntlet.\n\nReception\nChris Elliott reviewed Assassin! and Avenger!' for White Dwarf #71, giving it an overall rating of 8 out of 10, and stated that \"Plot and atmosphere may be a bit 'Kung Fu meets AD&D', but both add a few new twists to the adventure gamebook formula, and deserve credit for that. Overall, good entertainment value.\"\nIn the inaugural issue of The Games Machine, John Woods noted that \"the great appeal of these books is the detailed unarmed combat system. The rules have illustrations of the great variety of kicks, punches and throws available, and the player selects the best move to use against each opponent.\"\n\nSee also\nChoose Your Own
